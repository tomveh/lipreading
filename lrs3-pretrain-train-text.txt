AND PROBABLY THE THIRD TIME YOU WILL COME DIRECTLY TO THIS ROOM WITHOUT GETTING LOST BECAUSE YOU'VE MEMORIZED
AND I'VE REALLY FALLEN IN LINE WITH THIS REALLY WELL ALL MY LIFE
A GOOD METAPHOR FOR THIS AND ACTUALLY SOMETHING I WAS EXPERIENCING LITERALLY AT THE TIME IS A SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA BECAUSE
AND IT'S INVOLVED THE TRANSFORMATION OF MY LIFE FROM ONE CHARACTERIZED BY
I ALSO WANTED TO BUILD A BODY OF KNOWLEDGE AROUND MY PROJECT SO THAT I COULD LEARN HOW TO REPAIR OR EVEN MAKE SOME OF THE
AND FOR ME THIS WAS OVERWHELMING AND DEPRESSING AND PARALYZING
BY UTILIZING STREAMING VIDEO TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIAL MEDIA INTERACTIVITY I WAS ABLE TO CREATE A SPACE
BACK IN 2006 I DECIDED TO HAVE SOME FUN ONE DAY AND AS AN EXPERIMENT I RECORDED MYSELF PLAYING A
MORE PEOPLE THAN HAD EVER SEEN ME PLAY IN ALL THE YEARS OF MY LIFE COMBINED
HOW COULD I MAKE THEM FEEL LIKE THEY ARE IN THE SAME ROOM AS ME NOT JUST LISTENING BUT ACTIVELY CONTRIBUTING
VERY LITTLE RASCALS OUR GANG STYLE
THIS IS WHAT THE NEXT EDDY MURPHY COULD DO THIS IS WHAT YOU COULD CO
MIGHT NOT BE AS GOOD AS OFTEN AS THE PROFESSIONAL STUFF BUT YOU'D BE ABLE TO COMPENSATE FOR THE LACK OF
NOW YOU CAN'T BE CANCELED
I STILL CAN'T TIE WHEN I WAS 10 IT MUST HAVE BEEN WORSE
THAT'S GOING TO BE REALLY DIFFERENT
IF THEY DON'T LIKE YOUR ARTICLE THE WAY YOU WROTE THEY'LL REJECT IT
AND SOMETIMES I GET INTO MY HEAD TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THEM ABOUT WHAT LIFE WAS LIKE BEFORE THE
AND THIS IS EXTREMELY UNUSUAL I MEAN YOU GO BACK INTO HISTORY
I KNEW I WAS SERIOUS ABOUT IT BECAUSE I WENT INTO MY DAD'S WARDROBE CLOSET TOOK OUT LIKE HIS BEST SHIRT I'M SURE HE WAS THRILLED
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION
I WAS JOKING EARLIER IF YOU TAKE A BIG STAR LIKE AN EDDY MURPHY SOMEBODY WHO REQUIRED LIKE THEY
I MEAN TO A KID GROWING UP IN THE 1970S TELEVISION WAS A KIND OF MEDIA GOD I GUESS YOU COULD
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WHEN FIVE YEARS FROM NOW TEN YEARS FORM
WE'RE LIVING IN AN ERA WHERE MEDIA IS TRANSITIONING FROM A SORT OF AN ARISTOCRATIC
ACCESS TO AN AUDIENCE HAS BEEN DEMOCRATIZED
BUT THEY HAVEN'T SHUT YOU DOWN IF THEY DON'T DO THAT NOW THAT'S WHAT'S DIFFERENT THAN BEFORE
WE ARE LIVING THROUGH A TIME THAT IS A CREATIVITY REVOLUTION
I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THAT FOR AN EARLIER TIME PERIOD
WHAT IS ONE PERCENT OF A BILLION
IT'S 10 MILLION
THEY'LL GET A HALF MILLION PEOPLE WATCHING THAT SHOW AND IT'LL BE A DISASTER
THE REAL TRANSFORMATION HERE IS THAT MEDIA HAS BEEN DEMOCRATIZED
THAT'S WHAT'S DIFFERENT NOW
SOUNDED LIKE A GREAT IDEA RIGHT
AND MY DAUGHTER THINK THIS IS HYSTERICAL BY THE WAY
SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT IMMORTALITY IN A SENSE AND THE ABILITY TO GO AND CREATE SOMETHING AND
NOTHING THAT A NETWORK NEWS PROGRAM WHATEVER PUT ON TV BUT MY DAUGHTER LOVES IT
NOW YOU CAN'T HAVE ACCESS TO AN AUDIENCE SHUTDOWN
WHAT THAT MEANS IS YOU'RE LIVING IN THE FIRST ERA EVER WHERE YOU CAN DECIDE TO BE A PART OF MEDIA
THE SAILS MAY GATHER ENERGY FROM THE SOLAR WIND
ATMOSPHERIC PARTICLES GOT ENOUGH ENERGY TO BREAK FREE FROM THE GRAVITY OF THE PLANET ESCAPING AWAY TO SPACE NEVER
THE MAGNETIC FIELD MAY GATHER ENERGY FROM THE SOLAR WIND THAT ALLOWS EVEN MORE ATMOSPHERIC ESCAPE TO HAPPEN
THERE ARE TWO WAYS IF WE'RE GOING TO REDUCE THINGS A LITTLE BIT
7 MILLION SPECIES
THIS CAN'T HAPPEN ON MARS TODAY
THE ATMOSPHERE OF MARS TODAY IS TOO THIN AND TOO COLD FOR WATER TO BE STABLE AS A LIQUID
THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL THING ABOUT DNA IS THAT IT'S STABLE
WHY IS THAT
NOW ADMITTEDLY WE DO NOT HAVE THE PERFECT EXAMPLES YET IN HUMAN BEINGS
THIS IS WHERE THE STORY GETS A LITTLE STRANGE AND TO ME VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE FOR A LONG TIME
IT'S CALLED EPIGENETIC INHERITANCE
AND THAT'S TRUE YOU CAN'T CHANGE YOUR GENES
IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY AT SCIENCE FROM THE LAST FEW DECADES A VERY DIFFERENT LESSON EMERGES
WE ARE DESIGNED TO UPGRADE ON OUR OWN
USING MRI SCANS NEUROSCIENTISTS HAVE SEEN THE SUBTLE PHYSICAL CHANGES IN THE
WELL IT MEANS THAT WE CAN COME UP WITH A NEW THOUGHT A NEW ACTIVITY PATTERN WITHOUT KNOWING BEFORE
EVERY EFFICIENT PROCEDURE WILL BE REPLACED BY ALGORITHMS EVENTUALLY
HE MIGHT'VE HEARD THE WORD SMOKE DETECTOR ONLY ONCE OR TWICE BUT THAT WAS ENOUGH FOR HIM TO UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF THE
READ SOMETHING YOU DISAGREE WITH HAVE A PRODUCTIVE ARGUMENT WITH A FRIEND TRY TO SEE THINGS FROM THE OTHER
BUT THE OPPOSITE
WHAT DO I MEAN BY MISTAKE
SO FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE YOU HAVE TO SAY OKAY THE BRAIN IS EVERYTHING BUT PERFECT
MANY PEOPLE THINK IT ALL STARTS WITH DATA
JUST LIKE THE BRAIN
IT IS PEOPLE WHO ARE VICTIMS OF HOMOPHOBIA OR TRANSPHOBIA WHO ARE ALREADY VULNERABLE IN SOCIETY
CONSENT SHOULD BE OUR FOCUS BECAUSE WE WANT A BETTER WORLD AND WE WANT THE INTERNET TO BE A DRIVER OF A BETTER WORLD
WE HEAR THIS TALK OF PRIVACY ALL THE TIME IT'S ALWAYS LIKE OH INTERNET PRIVACY THEY ARE LOOKING UP YOUR PRIVATE
OR WE DECIDE THAT YOU COULD PUBLISH A PICTURE OF A PERSON WITHOUT ASKING THEM
THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO NEED THEIR PRIVACY MOST
I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT
I WE SHIFT THE CONVERSATION TO CONSENT WE MAKE IT MUCH MORE EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING WITH
IF WE DON'T FOCUS ON CONSENT IT WILL BE AT THE COST OF POLITICAL DISSIDENTS IT WILL BE AT THE COST OF SEXUAL AND GENDER MINORITIES
I THINK WE ALL HAVE A PRETTY REGULAR LIFE BUT WE ALL ALSO WANT THE
FOR SOME PEOPLE THEY WOULDN'T MIND BUT I DO MIND
WE NEED TO PUT THE FOCUS ON THE INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS TO CONSENT
IT WAS NOT A PROBLEM FOR THEM BUT IT WAS A PROBLEM FOR ME
IT MIGHT SEEM LIKE A WEIRD WORDING TO YOU BUT I REALLY HOPE BY THE END OF THIS TALK THAT CONSENT IS GOING TO BE A CENTRAL TENET OF HOW YOU
ALL THESE THINGS ARE RELATED IT ALL ABOUT INTERNET RIGHTS
AS OF TODAY
I FOUNDED A NON PROFIT ORGANIZATION CALLED KIDS RIGHT TO KNOW
MEANWHILE THE ORGANIC FARMER IS HELD LIABLE TO FIX THE PROBLEM
IT ALL STARTED WITH MY SPEECH IN GRADE SIX TO INFORM MY CLASSMATES
I WATCHED PEOPLE PURCHASE LARGE AMOUNTS OF CHIPS DIPS SODAS AND LEMONADES WITHOUT EVER KNOWING THE INGREDIENTS HAD BEEN
CANADA AND THE US ARE THE ONLY TWO INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS IN THE WORLD THAT DON'T REQUIRE MANDATORY
ANYONE WHO WAS MARCHING AGAINST MONSANTO WAS STUPID
THIS STUDY WAS DONE BY THE JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU THAT THIS CORN WAS NOT ENGINEERED TO TASTE BETTER OR TO GIVE YOU MORE NUTRIENTS OR TO BE
SOUNDS LIKE A TASTY AFTER SCHOOL SNACK TO YOU
NEW AND IMPROVED
WE WERE ALL THINKING WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT AND OUR COMMISIONARY IN THE EU LEWANDOWSKI SAID
IF YOU GO TO SWITZERLAND AND PEOPLE TELL YOU HOW WAS IN WARSAW
HE SAID IMPOSSIBLE PROTOCOLS BLA BLA BLA CALL FERNANDES AND TELL HIM TO DO IT
IT'S SUCH A DYNAMIC VIBRANT PLACE
THINK ABOUT HUNDRED BIGGEST COMPANIES IN THE WORLD
FOR YEARS WE WERE DISREGARDED PEOPLE WERE NOT INTERESTED IN WHAT POLES THINK
YOU'RE ALWAYS LATE THOUGH BECAUSE YOU JUST CAN'T DRUM UP THE NERVE
SO FUNNY I MET HER AT A CONFERENCE I SAW HER AT THE CONFERENCE
SO YOU ALREADY KNOW THE RULES
AND FOR SEVERAL WEEKS WE WORKED ON FACIAL EXPRESSIONS POSTURE BODY
BUT AFTER SHE LEAVES YOU FIGURE IT OUT SO YOU STAY THERE FOR A WHILE BECAUSE YOU'RE REALLY EMBARRASSED AND YOU'RE FIGHTING BACK TEARS AND
SO YOU START EATING KALE AND PARSLEY GARNISH FROM THE NOW EMPTY TRAY AND LECTURE YOUR CO
I'M A TEMPLE GRANDIN GROUPIE
IN THE END MAKING A GOOD FORTH IMPRESSION WASN'T ENOUGH TO WIN OVER THOSE PARTICULAR COLLEAGUES BUT
LIKE WITH MOST THINGS IN MY LIFE I RESEARCHED I ATTENDED CONFERENCES I HAD
HE WAS WILLING TO LOOK BEYOND MY LACK OF SOCIAL FINESSE IN THE WORK PLACE PASSED THE FIRST SECOND AND
WE ALL LIKE TO TICK OFF OUR BOXES
AND OF COURSE TEMPLE GRANDIN
AND TO LOOK AT TOYS WITHOUT TOUCHING
RICH AMAZING STORIES OF ALL REAL PEOPLE
IF YOU ARE A WILLING ASPIE ALLIED
AND YOU KIND OF LIKE IT THAT WAY BECAUSE IN REAL LIFE THERE IS NO EDIT FUNCTION
WHAT ARE YOU STARING AT
BUT THEN YOU THINK THEY MIGHT NOT AND YOU'RE NEVER QUITE SURE WHICH IT IS UNTIL SOMEBODY TELLS YOU OFF
SO INSTEAD YOU ANSWER
IT IS NOT AN EXCUSE TO REMAIN STUCK IN RIGIDITY AND INTOLERANCE
EVERYTHING IS RELIANT ON THESE COMPUTERS WORKING
9 MILLION U
FOR EXAMPLE THE ELEVATORS IN THIS BUILDING MOST LIKELY ARE CONTROLLED BY ONE OF THESE
AND EVEN IF WE ARE ABLE TO FIND ONLINE CRIMINALS QUITE OFTEN THERE IS NO OUTCOME
THE PC VIRUS PROBLEM IS 25 YEARS OLD NOW
AND THIS REALLY IS SOMETHING WHICH CREATES COMPLETELY NEW PROBLEMS FOR US
JAIN AND THAT BANK ACCOUNT HAD 14
LIGHT MATTERS FOR FUNCTION AND THEREFORE FOR HEALTH AND WATER MATTERS FOR
AND WHY DO YOU FEEL GOOD
SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THIS WERE A MUSCLE CELL THE PROTEINS WOULD BE IN ONE
THERE ARE SOME SUBSTANCES THAT ARE KNOWN THROUGH THE MILLENIA TO BE GOOD FOR HEALTH AND
WELL IT MIGHT BE SOME PSYCHOLOGICAL ISSUE BUT YOU'RE CONNECTING YOURSELF TO THE EARTH AND THE
SO WE UNDERGO NOT JUST PLANTS WE UNDERGO THE FIRST STEP IN
WELL YEAH I THINK SO
AND I'LL SHOW YOU ALSO THAT THAT LEADS TO MANY INSIGHTS IN TERMS OF OUR OWN HEALTH
BUT I WANT TO BE MORE SPECIFIC
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT
NOBODY WILL EVER DO THIS
A LOT OF WEDDINGS AT THAT HOTEL
AND IF YOU TELL ME THAT IGNORANCE AND THE LACK OF EDUCATION IS NOT A PROBLEM
IGNORANCE IS THE FIRST ENEMY OF THE U
SO I COME BACK TO MY INITIAL POINT
JAPAN HAS MADE AN ANNOUNCEMENT
YOU'RE BUILDING ON PEOPLE'S IDEAS AND VALUES THAT PERHAPS THEY'RE
AND THEN SOMEONE SAYS HOW SHOULD I KNOW
SOMETIMES YOU THINK THINGS ARE IMPOSSIBLE
AND GOD SHOOK HIS HEAD AND SAID NOT THIS YEAR NOT THIS DECADE PERHAPS NOT EVEN IN YOUR LIFETIME
AMERICA HAS MADE ITS FIRST DISPOSITION ON THIS WITH THE BILL THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA SHOULD BE
BUT WE DID GET AN AGREEMENT ON CLIMATE CHANGE
THEY DON'T DEAL WITH THE PROBLEMS
AND WE WOULD HELP THEM ADAPT
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT EVERYBODY DOES EXACTLY THE SAME THING BECAUSE WE'VE ACTUALLY GOT TO DO MORE FINANCIALLY TO HELP THE POOREST
I JUST THINK WE'RE NOT SEEING AT THE MOMENT THE HUGE OPPORTUNITIES OPEN TO US BY THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO
BUT OF COURSE THE TASK IS TO CREATE THE INSTITUTIONS THAT MAKE THAT GLOBAL SOCIETY WORK
SO YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A HEALTHY SENSE OF PATRIOTISM THAT'S ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO REALIZE THAT THIS WORLD HAS CHANGED FUNDAMENTALLY AND THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE CANNOT BE SOLVED BY ONE
IN FACT EVERY MAJOR HOUSEHOLD NAME IS ALLOWING YOU TO INTERACT WITH THEIR
I SAY THAT AS SOMEBODY WHO HAS PIONEERED TRANS MEDIA STORYTELLING
SO TAKING STORIES ACROSS PLATFORMS
BEING EMBARRASSED OF WHO YOU REALLY ARE
DEMOCRACY IN ALL ITS TRAPPINGS FREE ELECTIONS TOWN HALLS ENDLESS DEBATES ABOUT
TOO MESSY TOO UNPREDICTABLE TOO CONSTRAINING FOR YOUR TASTE
IN EARLY FEBRUARY 2014 A FEW WEEKS BEFORE RUSSIA WOULD INVADE CRIMEA A PHONE CALL IS POSTED
IT'S GOOD FOR YOUR HEALTH AND FOR YOUR PRODUCTIVITY
8 BILLION TIMES A DAY THAT TUNE IS PLAYED
IF WE ALL DO THAT WE MOVE TO A STATE THAT I LIKE TO THINK WILL BE SOUND LIVING IN THE WORLD
THAT'S AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE UP OR DOWN
SO IF I WERE TO PLAY THIS
MUSIC IS VERY POWERFUL AND UNFORTUNATELY IT'S VENEERING COMMERCIAL SPACES OFTEN INAPPROPRIATELY
I HOPE THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS
SO I DECIDED TO CONDUCT MY OWN LITTLE EXPERIMENT
LET'S OPEN OUR HEARTS AND OUR MINDS LET'S OPEN OUR EARS AND OUR MOUTHS AND LET'S
BUT PERHAPS THE MOST MEMORABLE MEETING I HAD OUT OF ALL OF THESE WAS WHEN I FOUND MYSELF
MIND YOU MY TEENAGE SELF BRISTLED AT SUCH A SUGGESTION BECAUSE I HAD IT ALL FIGURED OUT ON MY OWN
I'VE BEEN OFF MEDICATION FOR ALMOST THREE YEARS NOW
SO NOW I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE SCIENCE
I PULLED OFF ITS BAG
YOU CAN CHECK THEM OUT
GRANDPA TAUGHT ME ABOUT THE QUIET AND COHESIVE WAYS OF THE WOODS AND HOW MY FAMILY WAS KNIT INTO
I WENT TO MY FIRST BAG WITH THE BIRCH
I RAN MY GEIGER COUNTER OVER ITS LEAVES
STATES CAN ALSO BORROW MORE AND USUALLY AT A LOWER COST WHICH AGAIN HELPS TO INCREASE PUBLIC EXPENDITURE
THE ONLY THING THAT CAN PREVENT PROGRESS IS A FAILURE TO ADMIT THAT LOOKING BEYOND THE CURRENT PARADIGM CAN BE USEFUL
SHARE IT WITH OTHER PEOPLE
I KNEW IT WAS EITHER A BARRED OWL OR A GREY HORNED OWL JUST PROTECTING ITS BREEDING TERRITORY
IT WAS A DATA POINT I COULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN ANY OTHER WAY
WHERE DID THE BIRDS GO
THEY CAN ANSWER IMPORTANT QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE ABOUT THE WORLD
FOR THREE YEARS STEPHEN JR FLEW AROUND NOBODY ACTUALLY SAW HIM
THAT IS FLYING TO THE MOON BACK AND FORTH THREE TIMES
THE CORNELL LAB OF ORNITHOLOGY HAS A LEADING CITIZEN SCIENCE PROGRAM WHERE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT BIRDS
YOU ARE IN A TEDX AUDIENCE I KNOW YOU ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT OTHER THINGS
BE A GOOD CITIZEN
THE STORY EVOLVED MORE PEOPLE HAD THEIR CAPS STOLEN THE CITY PUT UP SOME SIGNS IT
I WANT YOU TO WALK AWAY THINKING THAT BIRDS ARE AWESOME THEIR STORIES MATTER AND THAT YOU CAN
IT JUST SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE
AS A SURGEON HE THOUGHT I AM HAVING A STROKE OR I HAVE BEEN HIT BY LIGHTNING
WE HAD A GOOD SENSE OF HUMOR ABOUT IT
WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THAT
HE FIGURED OUT WHERE IT WAS
THEN IT FLIES SOUTH FOR ANOTHER SUMMER
AND SCIENTISTS WERE READY FOR THIS PIECE OF EVIDENCE
TEN DAYS AFTER I HAD MARKED IT IN OREGON SOMEONE IN CALIFORNIA TOOK ITS PICTURE
IT WAS FEARLESS
IT BECAME A NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL STORY
AS MY FRIEND RYAN JACKS WHO WAS ATTACKED BY OWL CAPONE ONE MORNING JOGGING IN THE PARK SHARED WITH THE PAPER HE
IF YOU SEE A BIRD TAKE YOUR TIME LOOK AT IT TAKE A PICTURE SHARE IT
IT BREEDS IN AN ARCTIC SUMMER WITH A DAY OF ALMOST 24 HOURS LONG
THEY SORT OF FLY OFF AND GO AWAY
DAVID DO WHAT YOU CARE ABOUT
WE KNEW A LOT ABOUT HER LIFE AND THE DAY SHE DIED
THIS IS A YOUNG BIRD
SHE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST BIRDS TO HAVE THIS TAG
A GERMAN PERSON WHO WASN'T A SCIENTIST SHOT THIS BIRD
SHE BRED SHE HAD A FAMILY AND THEN STAGGERED THE WORLD
THINK ABOUT INSECTS
MANY TIMES THEY ARE PROTEINS
NOW I LOVED THOSE AMERICAN AND BRITISH BOOKS I READ
NOW I'VE LAUGHED EVERY TIME I'VE READ THIS
TODAY IF A PERSON'S FACE THAT IN THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT THEY WOULD MAKE A DECISION ONE WAY OR THE OTHER AND WE WOULD SAID
IT BECOMES A MUCH BETTER PROPOSITION TO ALWAYS USE A UBER RATHER THAN HAD THEIR OWN CAR
IF THERE'S A PEDESTRIAN THEY WOULD DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO AVOID THEM
THEY CLAIM TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT IN 8 HOURS OF TRAINING AND NOW THEY HAVE A ROBOT THAT CAN DO THAT
OH MY GOSH WE BETTER DO SELF DRIVING CARS WE CAN'T RELY ON GOOGLE'S SELF DRIVING CARS SO THEY STARTED A RESEARCH
DECIDED TO RUN INTO THE MOTORCYCLIST
RISK DYING YOURSELF OR SHOULD YOU RISK KILLING THE MOTORCYCLIST
WITH SELF DRIVING CARS THEY CAN DRIVE ALL THE TIME SO MUCH BETTER USE OF THE HARDWARE
THEY ARE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT PEDESTRIANS
THAT HAS LED TO WHAT PEOPLE HAS CALLING
IN THIS SITUATION WHAT SHOULD YOU DO
YOU CAN HAVE THE CAR APPROPRIATE FOR THE THING
MOST CARS TODAY JUST SITTING IN A PARKING LOT OR SITTING IN YOUR DRIVEWAY AND THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING
IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO WORK IN THE TECHNOLOGY AREA
THEY ARE THE WORLD'S LARGEST JOB CREATORS ABOUT 50000 NEW DIRVERS SIGN UP FOR
IT HAD A BUNCH OF INPUTS EACH INPUT HAD A WEIGHT COMBINE THOSE INPUTS WEIGHTED BY THESE WEIGHTS AND PRODUCE AN
THEY BEGAN TO USE THIS KIND OF NETWORK TO LEARN HOW TO RECOGNIZE SPEECH FOR EXAMPLE
PEDESTRIAN CHICKEN IN MOUNTAIN VIEW YOU'LL SEE A GOOGLE SELF DRIVING CAR IF YOU'RE A PEDESTRIAN AND YOU'RE ABOUT TO
LOUIS MY ENTIRE LIFE
WHEN MICHAEL BROWN JR
THAT'S SOMEONE WHO REALLY SEES US AS PART OF THE FAMILY
AND PEOPLE GENERALLY ASK ME WHY
AND IT WAS A TOPIC OF SHAME AND NO ONE REALLY WANTED TO TALK ABOUT IT
AND IT HAPPENS WHEN THERE'S A MISMATCH BETWEEN THE QUALITY AND THE QUANTITY OF RELATIONSHIPS THAT WE HAVE AND
I WAS SELF HARMING EVERY DAY
DURING MY TEENAGE YEARS WHEN I WAS MOST DESPERATE SAMARITANS BECAME MY LIFELINE
SO I'M NOW ON A MISSION TO HELP ORGANIZATIONS SOLVE THEIR WICKED PROBLEMS BY
IT DIDN'T WORK ALL THAT WELL
WE CAN REFUEL THIS VERY QUICKLY JUST BY PUTTING MORE FUEL INTO IT AND THE DEVICE IS UNCHANGED
IT'S THE LONE GUY IN A WOMEN'S STUDIES CLASS THE LONE WOMAN IN A COMPUTER SCIENCE CLASS THE BUDDING FEMINIST WHOSE TRYING TO
THIS WASN'T HOME YET
IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN THAT POWERFUL CRYSTALLIZATION OF ROOT FEELING
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN ON THAT PLANE OR ON THAT TRIP TO ISRAEL
MY VERY IDENTITY FELT LIKE IT WAS BEING CHALLENGED AND CALLED INTO QUESTION
WE CAN ALL AGREE ON THAT
I DIDN'T COME TO THAT GRAND INSIGHT QUICKLY
IT'S BEING DONE BY SOME IN THE INDUSTRY BUT NOT ENOUGH SO WE'RE PUSHING A LAW IN CONGRESS CALLED THE SAFE SEAFOOD ACT AND I'M VERY
FIFTY NINE PERCENT OF THE TUNA WE TESTED WAS MISLABELED
WE KNOW THAT WE CAN MANAGE OUR FISHERIES SUSTAINABLY
AND RED SNAPPER WE TESTED 120 SAMPLES AND ONLY SEVEN OF THEM WERE REALLY RED SNAPPER SO GOOD LUCK FINDING A RED
THIS DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PEAK FISH
IF WE DO A FEW SIMPLE THINGS IN TARGETED PLACES WE CAN BRING OUR FISHERIES BACK AND USE THEM TO
DO WE HAVE TO FIX FISHERIES MANAGEMENT IN ALL OF THOSE COUNTRIES
IN MOST OF THE CEREMONIES I NOTICED THAT MOST OF THE WOMEN AND GIRLS WERE NOT IN SIGHT
ONCE AT A FESTIVAL A MAN ASKED ME HOW I DARED PUT A DRUM IN BETWEEN MY LEGS
SOME FEAR HOW SOCIETY WILL PERCEIVE THEM
I NEED TO TALK ABOUT THE TRICORDER
HUMAN BEINGS DON'T LIKE TO BE TOLD WHAT TO DO WE'RE PROUD CREATURES WE THINK WE KNOW
SO HE SAW AT FIRST HAND JUST HOW HORRIFIC LIFE IS WITHOUT
HE IMAGINES WHAT THE WORLD WOULD BE LIKE WITHOUT A GOVERNMENT WHERE EVERYONE IS EQUAL
AND THE THIRD REASON THAT HOBBES GIVES FOR WHY THE STATE OF NATURE IS A STATE OF WAR IS THAT THERE ARE SOME OF
AND WE PLANTED ON PRAIRIE
CARING FOR THE PEOPLE CARING FOR NATURE SHARING
FIRST JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ME
BUT THESE ARE REALLY HIGH PERFORMANCE ATHLETIC ANIMALS
WHY IS THAT
BY THE INDIANS
TAKE A BEER MAT AND ROTATE IT BY A QUARTER OF A TURN THEN FLIP IT
IT WAS A VERY DELIBERATE ACT
AND THIS ENABLES US TO DISTINGUISH WHY THE SYMMETRIES OF THESE OBJECTS THEY BOTH HAVE SIX SYMMETRIES
IF I TOLD YOU 20 OR LESS STAND UP
IT'S ALMOST LIKE THE CONCEPT OF NUMBER BEING DEVELOPED FOR SYMMETRY
I CREATE MATHEMATICAL OBJECTS SYMMETRICAL OBJECTS USING GALOIS' LANGUAGE IN VERY HIGH
SO I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU THE CHANCE TO GET YOUR NAME ON A NEW SYMMETRICAL OBJECT WHICH HASN'T BEEN NAMED BEFORE
AND HE WROTE TO THE ACADEMICIANS IN PARIS TRYING TO EXPLAIN HIS THEORY
NOW SYMMETRY IS ALMOST NATURE'S LANGUAGE
ARTISTS TOO LOVE TO PLAY AROUND WITH SYMMETRY
IT SOUNDS IMPOSSIBLE BUT IN FACT IT WAS QUITE TRUE
THAT'S THE BEST WAY
AND YOUR JOURNEY IS SIMPLE IT'S MADE OF STEPS
DISABILITY IS ALSO AN INTERESTING DEMOGRAPHIC IN TERMS OF PEOPLE ENTERING THE DEMOGRAPHIC AND REHABBING OUT OF IT
A PROSTHESIS THAT WAS DESIGNED I WAS BORN WITHOUT LEGS DESIGNED TO FILL THAT
WELL I GUESS THAT PART'S ARGUABLE
THAT NUMBER COULD INCREASE BASED ON THE LIFE SPANS INCREASING
ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS YOU'LL NOTICE THIS IS TRUE FOR MANY PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT DISABILITIES IS THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT
THERE'S JUST A NUMBER OF THINGS WE DON'T KNOW ALL OF THEM LEADING TO
DISABILITY IS HERE TO STAY AND IT'S GOING TO AFFECT PEOPLE IN A BROADER RANGE THAN MOST OF US WANT TO
UNFORTUNATELY THIS COSTS ABOUT 100 GRAND IS NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE AND A LOT OF THE USERS FOUND THEY DON'T EVEN REALLY ENJOY
MY PARENTS THOUGHT IT BE GREAT PRACTICE TO PUT ME IN MY LEGS AND HAVE ME DO DISHES
SO WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT HERE IS THE LATEST VERSION OF MY BETTER HALF
BUT A BUNCH OF OLD GUYS GOT TOGETHER AND THEY NOTICED YOU DIDN'T HAVE LEGS AND THEY WERE JUST PUT YOU ON
OR IN THE WORDS OF F
I'M NOT GOING TO FAIL THAT
SO OUT OF THAT THE TEDX PROGRAM WAS BORN
SO REALLY TEDX IS YOUR PROGRAM
AT THAT TIME IT WAS BEFORE THE PROLIFERATION OF VIDEO
NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE WATCHING THE TALKS
SO AT THE TIME CHRIS AND I SAT DOWN TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE COULD DO TO REALLY TAKE THE TED BRAND AND OPEN SOURCE IT IN A
CLEOPATRA AND MARK ANTONY REUNITE AND AT THE END OF THE DAY THEY ARE BOTH DEAD BY THEIR OWN HANDS
THIS IS A POWERFUL WOMAN AN INDIVIDUAL
IT MAKES ME WANT TO PACK UP MY POWER SUIT AND GO HOME IT MAKES ME WANT TO GIVE UP
AND SINCE I AM ALWAYS A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS THAT PEOPLE THINK I'M UPTIGHT THIS WAS THE PERFECT POSTER FOR ME
WE WOULD NEVER CALL REAGAN RONALD
IF ANYTHING WHEN A WOMAN WEARS A SKIRT AND A BLAZER IT SHOULD BE A SKIRT SUIT I'LL GRANT
CAESAR IS THE HEAD OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE AND THEY FORM AN ALLIANCE
NO YOUNG WOMEN SHOULD BE RUNNING THE COUNTRY
YOU'RE MAYBE THINKING TO YOURSELF
THAT WAS THE WAY THAT SHE SAW OUT OF MARRIAGE AND TOWARDS SOLO RULE
THERE'S DEFINITELY AN EMPOWERING WAY TO DO IT BUT WHEN ALL THE IMAGES OF POWERFUL WOMEN FROM HISTORY LOOK LIKE THIS
AND EVEN TODAY MAYBE LAST WEEK IF YOU WANTED TO DRESS UP AS CLEOPATRA FOR HALLOWEEN YOU COULD HAVE
I DO IT A LOT TOO SO PLEASE FORGIVE ME BUT IT'S STRANGE BECAUSE WE DON'T CALL OBAMA
SO I HOPE THAT WE CAN DO THE SAME FOR THIS TALK
BUT LET ME TELL YOU
AND IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THIS IDENTITY SHE HAD TO DESEXUALIZE HERSELF
SO I PUT IT UP IN PROCTOR AND I LEFT IT HOPING THAT EVERYONE WOULD ENJOY IT JUST AS MUCH AS I DID
WE DO THIS ALL THE TIME WE TALK ABOUT CLEOPATRA AS THIS HOT VIXEN
IS HER HAIR PULLED BACK
WE'RE AFRAID OF PUSHING BOUNDARIES OF CHALLENGING THE STATUS QUO OF STANDING UP TO GENDER
SO SHE DECIDES TO FORM AN ALLIANCE WITH MARK ANTONY
I AM NOT ALONE MY SITUATION ISN'T UNIQUE OR EVEN SPECIAL
HE WAS ALSO HER BROTHER WHICH WAS NORMAL AT THE TIME
EGYPT WAS FACING A LOT OF TROUBLE DURING THIS ERA
THIS TALK IS ABOUT WOMEN IN POWER SO ASSUME THAT WHEN I SAY CLINTON I'M TALKING ABOUT HILARY CLINTON
THEY SEEM TO BE AFTER THE ONE THING THAT WE ALL HAVE THAT WE ALL POSSESS
BUT THE QUESTION IS WHAT CHOICES ARE WE MAKING IN OUR LIVES
40 IN THE MORNING
WE HAVE TO ENGAGE YOU
AND FROM THE DIRECTOR'S CHAIR IT MADE ME REALIZE SOMETIMES LIFE IS A BATTLE
WHAT IS MY PURPOSE IN LIFE
ARE WE MAKING THE HEROIC CHOICES SO OUR FAMILIES CAN SAY I LOVE YOU MUCH LIKE WE SAY I LOVE THAT
WE DON'T WANT TO FIGHT BUT KRISHNA SAYS YOU MUST FIGHT
THE FIRST IS CALLED THE ORDINARY WORLD
THAT'S A KICKSTARTER FOR THE CHARACTER SOMETHING HAPPENS TO THAT CHARACTER TO MAKE THEM DECIDE WHETHER I'M GOING
AND I REMEMBER LAYING IN BED AND MY MOM CRYING NO NO NO 3
SO FOR THE DIGITAL ME IT'S THE SAME THING
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO DO ALL KINDS OF EXPERIMENTS AT ALL
IT COSTS MANY DOLLARS TO DO ALL THE SEQUENCING AND SO FORTH
CAN YOU IMAGINE IF WE DID THAT ABOUT TECHNOLOGY
THE TWO GROUPS THAT DID EXERCISE WHETHER THEY WANTED TO OR NOT GOT THE BENEFITS OF OXYGEN IN THEIR BRAIN
IT WAS CALLED HUMANITY PLUS
SO WE DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW WHETHER WE DISCOVERED HOW TO MAKE FIRE AND THEN WE COULD EAT
ONE GROUP KEPT IN A CONFINED SPACE ONE GROUP WERE FORCED TO RUN ON A TREADMILL FOR A CERTAIN
THEY'VE ALSO HAD A LONGSTANDING MOVEMENT AROUND GENDER NEUTRAL CLOTHING AND GENDER NEUTRAL TOYS FOR
IF YOU SPEAK ENGLISH SPANISH AND PORTUGUESE
AND BRAIN SCANNING SHOWS THAT AT THE END OF THAT PERIOD OF LEARNING THE PART OF THE BRAIN THAT HAS TO DO WITH
SOME NEUROSCIENTISTS HAVE BEEN USING TRANSCRANIAL STIMULATION WHICH IS PASSING
AND THEN MY LOGICAL BRAIN KICKED IN AND I NEEDED TO KNOW
I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL INNOVATIONS THAT HUMAN BEINGS HAVE MADE
AND AS A VIRTUE IT'S A SET OF STRENGTHS FOCUSED ON CARING FOR OTHERS
HOWEVER I WILL SAY WHEN MOST PEOPLE MEET ME THEY ARE DISAPPOINTED
I WANT TO GO REALLY FAST
THE PROBLEM IS WHEN OUR RANGE NARROWS THAT PRODUCES SOMETHING CALLED THE LOW POWER
BUT HERE'S THE PROBLEM
I WANT TO END WITH A FEW WORDS FROM MY LATE FATHER THAT HE SPOKE AT MY TWIN BROTHER'S WEDDING
THE ANSWERS ARE ALWAYS THE SAME
THIS SHIRT OR THAT SHIRT
THERE'VE BEEN MULTIPLE TIMES IN MY LIFE WHERE I HAVE BEEN FOREWARNED THAT A LOW POWER PERSON HAS BEEN
OR SOMETIMES BEING NEW TO A COUNTRY LIKE AN IMMIGRANT OR NEW TO AN ORGANIZATION OR NEW TO AN EXPERIENCE
THIS IS SO POWERFUL
WHEN OTHER PEOPLE SEE ME AS POWERFUL THEY GRANT ME A WIDER RANGE
WHEN MY NIECE WAS FOUR SHE RESISTED GETTING DRESSED AND REJECTED EVERYTHING
HOW DO WE DO THAT
THEY BECOME MORE ASSERTIVE
WHAT IF I GAVE MY DAUGHTER A CHOICE
OKAY THAT SHIRT
ONE OF THE WAYS IS TO BE A MAMA BEAR
THEY SMILED A BIG BEAMING SMILE
MY EYES LIT UP
LET'S DO A LITTLE EXPERIMENT
ON AVERAGE WOMEN MAKE LESS AMBITIOUS OFFERS AND GETS WORSE OUTCOMES THAN
BUT HANNAH RILEY BOWLES AND EMILY AMANATULLAH HAVE DISCOVERED THERE'S ONE SITUATION WHERE WOMEN GET THE SAME
OKAY THAT PANT
I TOOK THEIR PERSPECTIVE I BECAME MORE INVESTED IN THEIR CAUSE I BECAME MORE COMMITTED TO THEM BECAUSE
WE HAVE VERY LITTLE LEEWAY
THROUGH THESE EXPERIENCES I'VE COME TO RECOGNIZE THAT EACH OF US HAVE SOMETHING CALLED A RANGE OF ACCEPTABLE
BUT SOMETIMES WE'RE TOO WEAK
POWER COMES IN LOTS OF FORMS
THEIR EYES LIT UP AND GOT BIG
THIS PANT OR THAT PANT
WE NEED TO QUALIFY THE MATERIAL WE NEED TO QUALIFY THE PROCESS
IT'S HAPPENING ALREADY
AND THEY HAD TO THIS WITH THE TOOLS AND THE MATERIALS THEY HAD ON THE SPACECRAFT
BUT ALL OF THIS IS ALL HAPPENING
AND NOW WE HAVE A TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN ENABLE THIS
I WENT TO THE UNIVERSITY AND I WAS TAUGHT EXACTLY THE OTHER WAY AROUND THAT IS REMOVING MATERIAL
AND WE NEED TO EDUCATE PEOPLE
SO EXTREMELY DIFFICULT
WE HAVE ALREADY 3D PRINTED A 1
WHERE ELSE CAN WE PRINT WITH 3D PRINTING
WHY SHOULD I BUILD ON THE SPACE STATION
BUT THINGS WORKED OUT WELL
MOST OF MY PEERS AND ESPECIALLY MY PARENTS COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT SOMEBODY WOULD DO WITH A MAJOR IN
BE STRONG SHE SAID
OH I KNOW IT'S A BIG STEP FOR YOU BUT IT'S NOT FOR HOOVER
MY LAB PARTNER AND I DISCUSSED THIS FOR ABOUT A YEAR
WAIT A MINUTE MAYBE THERE S A WHOLE NEW SET OF PARTICLES OUT THERE THAT WE HAVEN T EVEN SEEN
X RAYS TEND TO GO THROUGH EVERYTHING AND GAMMA RAYS EVEN MORE SO
REFLECTING GAMMA RAYS IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN T DO RIGHT NOW
MY SON IS WORTH BETTER THAN THIS
AND YOU KNOW WHY
THE FIRST AGE OF USING PORNOGRAPHY IS 12
WHEN YOU THINK THAT PORN IS THE MAJOR FORM OF SEX ED THINK WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE NEXT
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
WHAT DO YOU WANT HER TO DO
DICK WAS IMPRISONED FOR RAPING HIS 12 YEAR OLD STEPDAUGHTER AND HE WAS
LET'S GO BACK TO DETAILS
THIS SORT OF NEW PARADIGM SYSTEM WILL HAVE PROJECTS THAT SUPPORT MEETING LEARNING REQUIREMENTS WHILE ALSO SUPPORTING
OF COURSE IT IS
A REPORT CAME OUT IN THE EARLY 80'S CALLED
WE OBSERVED HIM USING THE VIDEO GAME IN CLASS
BUT I'VE SEEN THE SORT OF IMPACT THAT IT CAN HAVE I'VE SEEN A SCHOOL POPULATED WITH NOTHING BUT STUDENTS WHO WERE
IT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT
OR DEMONSTRATING HER SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY ENGINEERING AND MATH SKILLS BY DESIGNING A NEW MODEL
WE'RE SEEING MASSIVE CHANGE WHETHER IT'S SOCIAL OR TECHNOLOGICAL EVERYTHING IS SPEEDING UP
TODAY WE NEED COMPLEX PROBLEM SOLVERS
WHETHER OR NOT THE TEACHER WANTS TO GIVE YOU THAT TIME THERE IS NO CHOICE THERE
THEY KNEW IT WAS POSSIBLE
GIRLS WHO ARE BRAVE ENOUGH TO SIT OUTSIDE OF THEIR COMFORT ZONE
MY PARENTS WERE THERE TO SHARE THE MOMENT WITH ME
I WANT THERE TO BE MORE SISU GIRLS IN OUR WORLD
MY FOOTSTEPS HAVE NOT ALWAYS BEEN EASY
AND SO PUSHED ME A LITTLE TOUCH MORE
I WAS IN THE WORSE PLACE I'VE EVER BEEN IN A RACE BEFORE
IT WAS NOW OR NEVER MY PACER AND I AGREED
MY BODY CAME ALIVE
AND YOUNG PEOPLE DON'T FORGET JUST HOW POWERFUL YOU ARE AND HOW YOUR PEERS
UNICEF STATES THAT THERE ARE OVER 2
AND NEARLY 1 IN 4 24 SAID THAT THE BULLYING MADE THEM FEEL SUICIDAL
DON'T TAKE OVER THE PROBLEM INSTEAD GIVE THEM SOME OF THAT POWER BACK AND WORK WITH THEM TO COME UP WITH A SOLUTION
THEN WE ARE ABLE TO CALCULATE FOR SOMETHING CALLED SYNERGY
TWO OF THE MOST IMPORTANT HALLMARKS OF CANCER ARE GENOMIC INSTABILITY OF THE CANCERS WHICH MEANS THAT THEY HAVE
EACH CANCER CELL IS INCREDIBLY DIFFERENT FROM EVERY OTHER ONE
SINCE THEY'RE BOTH DNA DAMAGE RESPONSE PROTEINS WE'RE DIRECTLY TARGETING THE HALLMARKS OF CANCER
THAT CANCER THEN GOES THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE BODY EVENTUALLY CAUSING ORGAN FAILURE AND DEATH AMONG A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER
THEN A CELL MAY DIVIDE WHEN IT SHOULD'VE INSTEAD STAYED IN STASIS OR EVEN MORE LIKELY SHOULD'VE BEEN TAKEN OUT OF THE POPULATION
IN FACT SOME OF THE EARLIEST DISCOVERED HUMAN TISSUES IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES ARE RIDDLED WITH TUMORS AND SOME OF THE
WELL THEY HAVE TO BECOME INCREDIBLY RELIANT ON A FEW PROTEINS
AND IN FACT I HAD KIND OF MISSED THE BOAT BECAUSE IN 1990 UNESCO HAD RECOGNIZED THE SAME
THAT WAS THE MOMENT AT WHICH I REALIZED I NEEDED TO LEARN SOMETHING ABOUT MEDICAL MARIJUANA
AND NOTE WHAT I SAID WHEN NOT IF
IN MY OWN PRACTICE I'VE GOTTEN MUCH MORE CREATIVE AND FLEXIBLE IN SUPPORTING MY PATIENTS IN
MEDICAL MARIJUANA'S RISKS WE KNOW A LOT ABOUT THE RISKS OF RECREATIONAL USE WE KNOW NEXT TO NOTHING ABOUT THE RISKS OF MEDICAL
I ENDED UP WRITING A BOOK BASED ON THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND THAT BOOK REALLY REVOLVED AROUND THREE SURPRISES
THESE ARE THE SORTS OF QUESTIONS THAT MAKE ME CONFIDENT THAT THE PERSON I'M TALKING WITH REALLY HAS MY BEST
I GOT A LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION THAT WOULD LET ME BUY MEDICAL MARIJUANA
AND THIRD THE FOLKS BEHIND THE COUNTER
ASKING PATIENTS ABOUT THEIR HOPES THEIR FEARS THEIR GOALS AND PREFERENCES
WE DO NEED MUCH MORE EVIDENCE ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA
I'VE BEEN USING IT EVERY DAY SINCE
THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT
SO I STARTED READING MORE ARTICLES I STARTED TALKING TO RESEARCHERS I STARTED TALKING TO DOCTORS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY I
BUT WHAT SCARES THEM MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IS THIS POSSIBILITY THAT AT SOME POINT TOMORROW OR A
SHE WAS IN CONTROL
THEY CAN BE DANGEROUS IF THEY'RE OVERUSED BUT THEY CAN ALSO BE INEFFECTIVE IF THEY'RE NOT USED IN A WAY THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH WHAT
TO SHOW YOU WHAT I MEAN LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT ANOTHER PATIENT
SO I DECIDED TO FIND OUT
I WAS AMAZED AT HOW WILLING THOSE PEOPLE WERE TO SPEND SOMETIMES AN HOUR OR
BUT HERE'S THE POINT
MEDICAL MARIJUANA DISPENSARIES AND CLINICS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE FIGURING THIS OUT
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
AS A PALLIATIVE CARE PROVIDER I ASK ALL MY PATIENTS WHAT THEY'RE HOPING FOR AND WHAT THEY'RE AFRAID OF
THESE ARE THE SORTS OF QUESTIONS THAT PATIENTS LIKE ROBIN GET ASKED ALL THE TIME
HUGE OPPORTUNITIES TO LEARN FROM SOME OF THE TRICKS OF THOSE MEDICAL MARIJUANA DISPENSARIES TO PROVIDE MORE
THESE ARE OFTEN SMALL MOM AND POP OPERATIONS RUN BY PEOPLE WITH NO MEDICAL TRAINING
ALL OF US AT SOME POINT IN OUR LIVES WILL FACE A CHRONIC SERIOUS ILLNESS THAT CAUSES US TO LOSE
PEOPLE I MET WERE MORE THAN HAPPY AS I WAS SITTING NEXT TO THEM PEOPLE LIKE ROBIN TO TELL ME
I WAS ASKED AS A CONSULTANT TO SEE A WOMAN IN HER 70S RETIRED ENGLISH PROFESSOR
THOSE RISKS MAY NOT BE AS HUGE AND AS SCARY AS SOME OF THE OPPONENTS OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA WOULD HAVE US BELIEVE
MANY OF THE DRUGS I PRESCRIBE ARE DRUGS LIKE OPIOIDS OR BENZODIAZEPINES WHICH CAN BE
WE NEED MORE RESEARCH INTO BENEFITS WE NEED MORE EVIDENCE ABOUT RISKS
WE ALSO NEED TO ASK THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO RESCHEDULE MARIJUANA TO SCHEDULE II OR TO
BUT HERE'S THE THING
IT'S THE BEST DRUG I'VE DISCOVERED
THAT NIGHT I READ ALL OF THOSE ARTICLES AND FOUND A BUNCH MORE
WHEN I CAME TO SEE HER THE NEXT MORNING I HAD TO ADMIT THAT IT LOOKS LIKE THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE
WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF
THOSE WAITING ROOMS REALLY ARE A HIVE OF INTERACTION ADVICE AND SUPPORT
HOW TO INTERACT WITH HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS WHEN TO INTERACT WITH HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS HOW TO USE MEDICATIONS
IT WAS AMAZING
AND THAT'S A WAKE UP CALL WE REALLY NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEIR TRICKS ARE WHAT THEIR TOOLS ARE AND WE NEED TO LEARN FROM THEM
THINK ABOUT THE LAST TIME YOU WENT TO ANY HOSPITAL OR CLINIC AND THE LAST TIME ANYBODY SPENT AN
WE SIGN AND THERE'S ALL THIS HYPE LEADING UP TO OUR NEXT RECORD
AND THEY WALK OFF
PEOPLE WOULD YELL AT ME FROM THEIR CARS
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN WITH MY BAND OR MY CREW
IS THIS WHAT STUPID PEOPLE DO
YOU CAN'T CATCH IT FROM ANYONE
IT WAS SUCH A FREE MEANS OF SELF EXPRESSION
THERE WASN'T EXACTLY THAT BIG PRIZE MONEY TO BE WON AND THE PARTIES WEREN'T EXACTLY BIG BUDGET
SO WITH THAT DESCRIPTION SURELY ANY ONE OF US COULD BE A HACKER
IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE SOMETHING THAT WORKED FOR THEM THEY'D JUST MAKE IT THEMSELVES
AND THEY WERE
I GATHERED THE GIRLS AND WE RAN OUT
I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE I WAS GOING BUT GOING BACK WAS NOT AN OPTION
I LOVED MY NEW FOUND FREEDOM
I SAW EYES THAT COULD BREAK CYCLES AND REDEFINE WHAT MASCULINITY MEANT FOR A NEW GENERATION OF
WE'VE BEEN TOLD IT'S ABOUT RIDDING OUR CULTURE OF SEXIST THINKING IN ORDER TO LIBERATE WOMEN
I HAVE A FATHER
IN FACT AUTOMATION IS SPREADING TO EVERY PRODUCTION LINE IN EVERY COUNTRY AROUND THE WORLD
COMPANIES TODAY FOCUS ON MANUFACTURING WHAT THEY PRODUCE BEST AND MOST EFFICIENTLY
I'M A SUPPLY CHAIN PROFESSIONAL AND I LIVE AND WORK IN MEXICO
MIKE LOST HIS JOB TO A MACHINE
WHEN I HEAR STORIES LIKE THIS I THINK THAT WHAT PEOPLE PICTURE IS THAT TRADE HAPPENS BETWEEN ONLY TWO
SO LET'S APPLY THIS PROCESS TO THE CORPORATE WORLD
THINK ABOUT HOW YOUR HOUSE WAS BUILT OR YOUR KITCHEN RENOVATED
THINK ABOUT IT
NOW THIS APPROACH TO PROCESSING GOES ON ALL AROUND THE WORLD TO MANUFACTURE MANY OF THE PRODUCTS
SO THAT MEANS THAT ONE OUT OF 10 LOST MANUFACTURING JOBS WAS DUE
RECENTLY WE'VE HEARD A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES TALK ABOUT RESTRICTING IMPORTS AND PROTECTING THEIR
WE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THIS DURING THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
SOME HAVE BLAMED TRADE FOR SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WE'VE BEEN HAVING HERE AT HOME IN THE US
AND HE WAS ANGRY
AND IT'S OK AND WHEN I FEEL LIKE RUBBISH I'M REALLY GOING TO EMBRACE THAT RUBBISH FEELING I'M PROBABLY GOING TO GET INTO BED I'M GOING TO WATCH
I REMEMBER ONE YOUNG MAN
GOOD MORNING EVERYONE
AH THERE WE GO
VIOLENCE IS EVERYWHERE
AND ALL THIS BY SIMPLY WATCHING THE CHILD'S BRAINWAVES
WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MANAGE THE ENVIRONMENT AND AVOID THE TERRIBLE CLIMATE CRISIS IF WE DON'T STABILIZE THE WORLD
THEY HAVE HERE SINGAPORE
AND THERE WAS SOCIO ECONOMIC PROBLEMS WHICH ARE NOW BEING SOLVED AT A MUCH BETTER SCALE
LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT
THAT IS WHEN WE GET GIRLS IN SCHOOL WE'LL GET AN IMPACT 15 TO 20 YEARS LATER WHICH IS A
THEY GET SAMSUNG HOW CAN THEY BE A DEVELOPING COUNTRY
AND THEN THEY GOT THE ASWAN DAM
WE HAVE TO HAVE A MODERN CONCEPT WHICH FITS TO THE DATA
IT'S NOT ABOUT JUST FIVE YEARS IT'S LONG TERM INVESTMENTS
NOW THIS SOUNDS A LITTLE THEORETICAL BUT IT'S NOT SO THEORETICAL
BUT THEN I HEAR PEOPLE SAYING THERE IS NO PROGRESS IN AFRICA
IF THEY DIED AT WHAT AGE AND WHAT YEAR
WE ARE MEN AND WOMEN OF ALL RACES AND SEXUALITIES WORKING TOGETHER
THEREFORE WHAT I WANT TO SAY TO YOU TODAY IS IT'S TIME TO TALK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND RIGHTS
OF THEIR OWN BODIES OR THE BODIES OF THEIR PARTNERS
SEXUAL REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND RIGHTS REMAIN SEEN AS A WOMEN'S ISSUE AND PRIMARILY THEIR RESPONSIBILITY AND
MEN NEED SEX MORE THAN WOMEN DO AND THAT'S WHAT WOMEN EXPECT
THIS MAN REFLECTING THE BEHAVIOR AND VIEWS OF SO MANY OTHERS PUT HIS OWN SEXUAL PLEASURE
NOW I WANT TO SHARE THIS PICTURE WITH YOU
THERE ARE OTHER THINGS LIKE GENETIC DIFFERENCES IN POPULATIONS THAT MAY LEAD TO
WHEN THEY GET DAMAGED SAY BY CIGARETTE SMOKE FOR EXAMPLE THEY DON'T WORK PROPERLY
AND THIS IS KEY TO THE POTENTIAL OF THAT TECHNOLOGY
THEY'VE EVEN TRY TO GROW LITTLE MINI ORGANS IN THE LAB
15 MINUTES LATER I WAS ON MY WAY TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM WITH A FULL BLOWN ASTHMA ATTACK
I WANT TO SHARE THIS WITH YOU BECAUSE IT'S A BEAUTIFUL PHOTOGRAPH
AND WE'RE DOING JUST THAT
CHILDREN ARE NOT ADULTS THEY MAY NOT RESPOND IN THE SAME WAY ADULTS DO
AND WHY ARE THIS USEFUL
WE'RE ESTABLISHING IMPORTANT INDUSTRY COLLABORATIONS SUCH AS THE ONE WE HAVE WITH
PLUG AND PLAY
I TOOK SOME ADVIL
NOW IMAGINE IF WE COULD TAKE CELLS FROM ALL THOSE DIFFERENT POPULATIONS PUT THEM ON CHIPS AND CREATE
NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT THE FIRST ONE
THERE'S FLUID FLOWING ACROSS THESE CELLS SO WE CAN BEGIN TO INTERCONNECT MULTIPLE DIFFERENT CHIPS
I JUST COULDN'T SHAKE IT THOUGHT I'LL TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT
WELL THERE'S A MULTITUDE OF FACTORS AT PLAY BUT I THINK ONE OF THE KEY FACTORS IS THAT THE TOOLS THAT
WE NEED HUMAN CELLS BUT WE NEED TO FIND A WAY TO KEEP THEM HAPPY OUTSIDE THE BODY
IT REALLY JUST ISN'T WORKING AND THAT MEANS THAT PATIENTS THAT BADLY NEED NEW
OUR CELLS EXPERIENCE THAT
AND THOSE INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES MEAN THAT WE COULD REACT VERY DIFFERENTLY AND SOMETIMES IN
BOTH MUNCHKIN AND BUMP HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE OF THE BITTER
PLEASE STAY CURIOUS
SO BABY MUMCHKIN HAS GOT THESE BASIC TASTES GOING ON
BUT SOMETIMES I THINK THAT YES THOSE THINGS DO RESTRICT US BUT NOT AS MUCH AS WE LIKE TO THINK THEY DO
ONE OF THESE GAMES WAS
WE NOW KNOW THAT WHATEVER WE LEARN WHATEVER WE ARE DOING WHATEVER WE ARE INTERACTING WITH WILL
NOTHING IS SET IN STONE EVER
AND I WASN'T TAKING MUCH NOTICE BECAUSE I WAS IN TOO MUCH OF A FOUL MOOD BY NOW
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE WHOLE WEEKEND WAS LIKE THAT
MUMCHKIN IS BORN
ALL THE CHILDREN HAD TO SIT ON A CIRCLE AND EACH CHILD TOOK IN TURNS TO BE IN THE MIDDLE
WE WENT ON FRIDAY NIGHT DUE TO COME HOME ON THESUNDAY
SO CURIOSITY IS THE MAIN MOTIVATOR FOR US TO STAY INTERESTED IN THINGS SO
BECAUSE I CAN PINPOINT THE EXACT DAY WHEN I FIRST REALISED THAT MY CORE OF MY VERY BEING WAS
YEARS AGO WHEN MY CHILDREN WERE REALLY
SO I FOUND A UNIVERSITY THAT DID SOCIAL ANTHROPOLOGY AND I HAD TO CHOOSE IT WITH ANOTHER SUBJECT SO I CHOSE IT WITH
AND EQUALLY OUR AGING BRAIN LOVES IT EVEN MORE BECAUSE IT HELPS OUR AGING BRAIN STAY HEALTHY
AND IT IS NOT TRUE
SO ALL IS GOOD
AS LONG AS YOUR ARE CURIOUS
THE FIRST FIVE BASIC FLAVORS ARE
WITHIN THE FOURTH YEAR I REALISED ACTUALLY SOCIAL ANTHROPOLOGY WAS SO HARD THAT ACTUALLY
I WAS SO FIRED UP SO FIRED UP THAT I GOT HOME PUT THE CHILDREN TO BED I WAS COMPLETELY
AND MY FRIEND AND THIS GIRL IN THE BACK WERE TALKING
SO THERE'S HELP FOR MUNCHKIN BECAUSE MUNCHKIN IS COMING ALONG NOW
BECAUSE IT IS JUST A LIST
YOU CAN LEARN ANYTHING YOU CAN INVOLVE YOURSELF IN DIFFERENT KINDS OF SOCIAL GROUPS ALL SORTS OF STUFF
IT WAS FOR YOGA AND MEDITATION FOR ADULTS AND LITTLE PEOPLE
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
THEY HAD EMBRACED THIS WHOLE NEW WORLD
THEIR CURIOSITY WAS ENORMOUS
I WOULDN'T BE
BECAUSE WHAT THERE IS AT THE END OF IT IS INESTIMABLE
OLDER PARENTS YOUNGER CHILDREN
BUT OF COURSE THE MOTHER EXPERIENCING ALL THOSE FOOD FOR REAL IS
I WAS AGE SEVEN
I'VE GOT TO GO TRAFFIC IS BUILDING UP
AND NOW THE TASTE IS PROPERLY FORMED SO THE BABY CAN TASTE THINGS THROUGH THE AMNIOTIC SAC
SHE STARTED TO EXPLAIN IT AND THE MORE SHE EXPLAINED THE MORE QUESTIONS I ASKED
THE POINT IS THE MENU IS INFINITE
I SHOOT SHOT RIGHT BACK TO THEN AND I THOUGHT
BUT IN THAT SAME WEEKEND I LEARNED SOMETHING ABOUT MY OWN CURIOSITY
SO SHE TRIED SOME OF THE COOKING APPLE
BECAUSE I HAD SMALL CHILDREN I HAD TO THINK ABOUT A UNIVERSITY THAT WAS LOCAL TO WHERE I LIVED
SOCIAL ANTHROPOLOGY IS ALL ABOUT PEOPLE
I ACTUALLY WENT ON THIS WEEKEND WITH A FRIEND
IT MIGHT BE THAT
CURIOSITY AND WANTING TO FIND OUT ABOUT THINGS IS A MASSIVE MOTIVATOR AND IT ALSO STIMULATES THE REWARD
WE HAVE GOT THIS WONDERFUL MENU OF ALL THE THINGS OR MENUS OF ALL THESE EQUATIONS OF THINGS WE CAN DO IN LIFE
SHE WAS TAKING AGES AND AGES TO COME OUT AFTER SAYING GOODBYE TO ALL THESE PEOPLE
THE COMBINATION OF ALL THESE THINGS IS ABSOLUTELY MASSIVE
NOW PROGRAMMING FOR THOSE OF YOU HERE THAT HAVEN'T DONE IT YOURSELF REQUIRES LAYING OUT IN
SO IMPORTANT WAS THIS THAT IN FACT THE SUCCESS WAS COVERED IN THE NEW YORK TIMES IN A FRONT PAGE ARTICLE A FEW WEEKS LATER
FOR EXAMPLE THESE FOUR ALGORITHMS WERE ALL BUILT BY THE SAME GUY
THAT MARLOWE AND SHAKESPEARE BOTH ALLOW THEIR JEWS TO MAKE THIS POINT SUGGESTS I THINK A SHARED UNDERSTANDING
HE WANTS THE POWER TO COMPEL IDENTIFICATION
MY HUSBAND CUT TWO FINGERS OFF HIS LEFT HAND WITH A TABLE SAW
JONES WHO SPENT EIGHT HOURS IN SURGERY WITH A MICROSCOPE PUTTING THOSE FINGERS BACK ON SO THAT MY HUSBAND HAS TEN FINGERS TODAY
WE ALL KNOW IT
YEAH SO THANK GOD FOR DR
AND THIS IS POSSIBLE FOR YOU
BUT TO THE BODY STRESS IS VERY DIFFERENT
SO WE'VE MADE THIS COLLECTIVE AGREEMENT
BECAUSE I HAVE A DREAM OF A HEALED HEALTHCARE SYSTEM ONE IN WHICH WE BRING THE BEST OF
THIS SOUL MEDICINE' I THINK IS SO MUCH OF WHAT WE'VE LOST IN MODERN MEDICINE TODAY
CAN I GET AWAY WITH THAT
I MEAN I LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY
YOU CAN SEE THE POWER OF WHERE THAT'S GOING TO GO FOR US
IT'S GOING TO BE OFFSITE DEVICES
THEY LOVE IT
SO PEOPLE WHO NOW CARRY A 3 INCH DEVICE VS
SO WE ARE GOING TO SEE MAINSTREAM GO NICHE
SO THEY TREAT THEM LIKE VIPS
THAT WAS THE SKIN IN THE GAME
DON'T THINK ABOUT IT AS DEDICATED TO SCREENS
IT'S GOING TO BE MOBILITY DRIVEN
SO THE NEXT GENERATION I THINK WE ARE GOING TO MOVE TO IS THE CONNECTION GENERATION
THAT'S WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT IN THE FUTURE OF ADS
THAT'S THE WORLD THAT WE ARE IN TODAY
IT'S TECHNOLOGY IT'S CONTENT AND DISTRIBUTION
IT'S NO LONGER 2007
THIS CATEGORY HAS ONLY BEEN AROUND FOR COUPLE OF YEARS
THEY TEND TO CONVERT HIGHER
AND DON T THINK ABOUT ONLINE OFFLINE ANYMORE
WOULDN'T IT BE NICE TO BE ABLE TO A TEST A DRUG TO SEE IF IT'S EFFECTIVE AND SAFE WITHOUT HAVING TO
IT MATTERS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
THE PAYOFF IS ENORMOUS BOTH IN TERMS OF HEALTH AND IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH
HOW DO WE GO FASTER
YOU PROBABLY KNOW IF YOU'VE BEEN PAYING ATTENTION TO SOME OF THE SCIENCE LITERATURE THAT YOU CAN NOW TAKE A SKIN CELL AND ENCOURAGE IT TO
IT MATTERS FOR NOW
THIS IS THE 21ST CENTURY BIOLOGY THAT YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR AND WE HAVE THE CHANCE TO TAKE THAT
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME JUST ASK SAM
WE NEED TO SUPPORT THAT
AND THIRD AND MAYBE MOST IMPORTANT WE NEED TALENT
WELL AGAIN BY KNOWING SOMETHING ABOUT THE MOLECULAR PATHWAYS IT WAS POSSIBLE TO PICK ONE OF THOSE MANY MANY
ONLY ABOUT 250
THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS
BUT IT TOOK 23 YEARS TO GET THIS FAR
THE ROAD WAS TOO ROUGH
SO BEING A MECHANICAL ENGINEER BEING AT MIT AND HAVING LOTS OF RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO ME I THOUGHT I'D TRY TO DO SOMETHING
IT MEETS OUR NEEDS
AND THEN FINALLY TO GET THIS OUT TO THE PEOPLE IN SCALE WE TEAMED UP WITH THE LARGEST DISABILITY ORGANIZATION IN THE WORLD
IT'S NOT A REDUCTIVE LABEL
NEITHER OF MY PARENTS EVER CONFORMED TO TRADITIONAL GENDER ROLES
THEY BOTH BROUGHT MY BROTHER AND I UP
THEY BOTH WORKED
I THINK THAT IN PAST FEW YEARS I HAVE FOUND OUT ABOUT QUITE A FEW THINGS THAT WORK FOR ME BUT IT'S THE FINAL
NO IT WAS THAT AUDIBLE SIGH OF GENUINE SURPRISE THAT I HAD HEARD WHEN SHOWING THE SECOND PICTURE THAT
I DON'T GET WHY SHE'S ON STAGE SHE'S STILL FAT
SO HAVE I FOUND ALL THE INGREDIENTS TO MY RECIPE OF LOSING WEIGHT AND KEEPING THE WEIGHT OFF AND
AND I FOUND THEIR THEORY SURPRISINGLY APPLICABLE TO THE PROCESS OF LOSING WEIGHT
SO OUR CAVEMEN IN THE STONE AGE DIDN'T HAVE ANY NOTICE OF COMPLEXITY HIS LIFE WAS
I SHOWED THE AUDIENCE THE SAME TWO PICTURES LEAVING THE SECOND ONE TO RIGHT BEFORE THE END
WE FOLLOW THE PLANTING CYCLES
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I WORKED OUT IN COLORADO
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
WE GOT A PRETTY AMAZING ANSWER
WHEN I FIRST GOT INVOLVED IT WAS A SMALL STEP
I DIDN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT OLPC BEFORE MY FRIENDS GOT INVOLVED
IT'S VERY NATURAL FOR ME TO THINK ABOUT HOW MY ACTIONS BENEFIT ME
YOU HAVE TIME
HOW CAN I HELP
BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR THE WORLD THAT WE WANT TO CREATE
OLPC ASKED ME AND MY FRIEND PAUL TO RUN A NEW PROGRAM FOR THEM CALLED OLPC CORPS
BUT IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO TAKE THAT STEP
BUT I TOOK THE PLUNGE
OLPC BELIEVES THESE THINGS TOO
BECAUSE WITHOUT IT I WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THIS PASSION I HAVE FOR THE PROJECT
BUT I TRIED SOMETHING WHEN I GOT INVOLVED WITH OLPC
SHARING IDEAS IS WONDERFUL AND INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN FROM MY INVOLVEMENT
WE'D ASK THEM TO PARTNER WITH SCHOOLS AND NON PROFITS IN AFRICA
WE'D FUND THEM TRAIN THEM SEND THEM LAPTOPS
I WANTED TO GET INVOLVED TO PRODUCE
YOU HAVE TALENT
HOW CAN WE HELP
I WAS WORRIED THAT I WOULD BE STEPPING ON SOMEONE'S TOES IF I GOT INVOLVED
MY STORY BEGINS ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO IN THE SUMMER OF 2008
BUT I WAS STILL INTERESTED
IT DEMANDS ACTION
IT'S A GOOD AMOUNT OF WEIGHT DON'T YOU THINK
I DIDN'T EVEN RECOGNIZE IT AS MY OWN MISTAKE
WELL THIS IS WHERE MY PERSONAL STORY STARTS
AND THEY'LL BRING WITH THEM THE KNOWLEDGE THAT CODE LITERACY IS AN IMPORTANT SKILL
AND WE ASKED EACH SCHOOL TO GIVE US FEEDBACK AT END OF EACH PROJECT SO WE COULD REFINE THEM AND MAKE THEM
MOST TEACHERS DON'T KNOW HOW TO CODE
EACH ONE CREATES A TOY AN ANIMATION OR A GAME
WE WILL HAVE ABOUT 20 CLUBS BY THE END OF THE YEAR
SO WHILE THESE 300 SOUNDS LIKE A BIG NUMBER IT'S ACTUALLY ONLY 1
WE ASKED THE KIDS TO RATE THE PROJECTS
BORING TO 100
SO THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE OUR PROGRESS IN THE FUTURE
IT'S ALSO A VERY VERY USEFUL LIFE SKILL
AND ENCOURAGES CREATIVITY
AND GET ON WITH IT
YES BECAUSE MOST COMPANY FOUNDERS HAD A VERY STRONG BELIEF AND WILL TO
HELP PEOPLE WITHIN THESE COOPERATIONS TO LOOK OUT THEIR WINDOWS AND
WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF ACCOUNTANCY TODAY
ALL I COULD DO WAS WISH SOMEONE APPROPRIATE WOULD APPEAR AND SOLVE
THE NEWS WERE SO SUDDEN FOR ME
AND TEN DAYS AFTER GETTING THE KREBIOZEN THEY WERE GONE
I COMPILED THEM ALL INTO MY UPCOMING BOOK MIND OVER MEDICINE
IT'S ACTUALLY IN THEIR PHYSIOLOGY
AND THEN ALL THOSE NATURAL SELF REPAIR MECHANISMS CAN COME INTO PLAY
SO HE DOSED HIM UP ON A FRIDAY NOT EXPECTING THAT MR
MORE SO THAN QUITTING SMOKING OR STARTING TO EXERCISE
IT'S NOT AN EASY PROCESS TO GO THROUGH ALONE SO IT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE IF SOMEBODY ELSE IS HOLDING THAT POSITIVE BELIEF WITH YOU
I LOVE THE ROGAIN STUDIES
YOUR SPIRITUAL LIFE MATTERS
AS DOCTORS WE THINK WE'RE BEING REALISTIC YOU KNOW
BUT I WANT TO GIVE YOU A FEW HIGHLIGHTS ABOUT WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT
THIS IS MEASURABLE
YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO THE BODY
THEY HAD MELTED LIKE SNOWBALLS ON A HOT STOVE
WRIGHT TIME WAS REALLY RUNNING OUT
HE HAD TUMORS THE SIZE OF ORANGES IN HIS ARMPITS NECK CHEST ABDOMEN
WEST JUST COULDN'T DO THAT
BUT DO NOT HURRY THE VOYAGE AT ALL
BUT SHE HAS NOTHING MORE TO GIVE YOU
BUT I'M GIVING A TEDX TALK AND YOU DON'T KNOW HOW HAPPY MY MOTHER
ONE HAS LACROSSE ON THE NEAR SIDE OF TOWN
AND I SAID BUT WHAT IF THEY DRIVE INTO A DITCH
SHE SAID DO I GET ONE FIVE MINUTE OVERREACTION OR CAN I GET 10 30 SECOND
THEY WERE TOO BLOATED OR TOO OUT OF DATE BY THE TIME THEY WERE DONE
WHAT DIDN'T WORK WELL
SO MOVE WHERE YOU SIT
WITH KIDS IT'S HEAVEN
WE WERE LIVING IN COMPLETE CHAOS ELEANOR SAID
WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT THE AGILE SYSTEM IS YOU BUILD IN A SYSTEM OF CHANGE SO THAT YOU CAN REACT TO WHAT'S HAPPENING TO YOU IN REAL TIME
NOW GIVE US A PUNISHMENT
WE DON'T LIKE DILEMMAS
THERE'S PLENTY OF PARENTAL AUTHORITY GOING ON
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT HAVING FAMILY DINNER WITH YOUR CHILDREN IS GOOD FOR THE KIDS
MY WIFE COUNTS THEM AMONG HER MOST TREASURED MOMENTS AS A MOM
YOU HAD BLOGS POP UP AND SOME MANUALS WERE WRITTEN
IT FELT LIKE WE WERE KIND OF LAYING THESE UNDERGROUND CABLES THAT WOULDN'T LIGHT UP THEIR WORLD FOR MANY YEARS TO COME
WHEN I BECAME A PARENT I FIGURED YOU KNOW WHAT
THIS FAMILY MISSION STATEMENT IS A GREAT WAY TO IDENTIFY WHAT IT IS THAT YOU DO RIGHT
HE SAID YOU CAN'T UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF DOING THIS
SO HE LED US THROUGH THE PROCESS OF CREATING A FAMILY MISSION STATEMENT
JUST AS I WAS LEAVING TO COME HERE TONIGHT ONE OF MY DAUGHTERS STARTED SCREAMING
I'M NOT HOME CAN'T MAKE FAMILY DINNER
SO HOW CAN WE CHANGE THIS DYNAMIC
AND WE HAD THIS GREAT CONVERSATION LIKE WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO US
I'VE MENTIONED JUST THREE HERE TODAY ADAPT ALL THE TIME EMPOWER THE CHILDREN TELL YOUR
ADAPTABILITY IS FINE BUT WE ALSO NEED BEDROCK
THE CONVERSATION WILL GO BETTER
I WAS TALKING TO WARREN BUFFETT'S BANKER AND HE WAS CHIDING ME FOR NOT LETTING MY CHILDREN MAKE MISTAKES WITH THEIR ALLOWANCE
SO I TURNED TO DAVID SO WHY DOES IT WORK
ONE HAS ASPERGER SYNDROME
THEY DO THINGS IN SMALL CHUNKS
SO AGILE IS GREAT FOR STIMULATING PROGRESS BUT I KEPT HEARING TIME AND AGAIN YOU NEED TO PRESERVE THE CORE
AND THESE MEETINGS HAD THIS EFFECT WHILE TAKING UNDER 20 MINUTES
WE ARE TRAVELERS NOT TOURISTS
YOU HAVE DAILY UPDATE SESSIONS
THE POINT IS THERE ARE ALL THESE NEW IDEAS OUT THERE
EACH UNHAPPY FAMILY IS UNHAPPY IN ITS OWN WAY
IF WE GET 15 MINUTES OF OVERREACTION TIME THAT'S THE LIMIT
IT TURNS OUT THERE'S ONLY 10 MINUTES OF PRODUCTIVE TIME IN ANY FAMILY MEAL
LET'S TALK ABOUT IT
SO HOW DO YOU DO THAT
EVEN THE SUTHERLANDS TOLD ME THAT THEY HAD AN AGILE THANKSGIVING WHERE YOU HAD ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE WORKING ON THE FOOD
MY WIFE BOUGHT A FLIP CHART
AND WE ENDED UP WITH 10 STATEMENTS
AS THE AUTHOR OF THE STUDY TOLD ME CHILDREN WHO HAVE A SENSE OF THEY'RE PART OF A LARGER NARRATIVE
BUT I WAS WRONG
A FEW WEEKS LATER WE GOT A CALL FROM THE SCHOOL
WHAT WORKED WELL THIS WEEK
AGAIN RESEARCH SHOWS THAT PARENTS SHOULD SPEND LESS TIME WORRYING ABOUT WHAT THEY DO WRONG AND MORE
WE'VE GOT TO HOOK THEM UP WITH PARENTS
SPEND THE TIME HOWEVER YOU WANT
JUST WHEN OUR KIDS STOP TEETHING THEY START HAVING TANTRUMS
AS SUTHERLAND TOLD ME WE GOT TO THAT ARTICLE AND SAID THAT'S IT
WE'LL HAVE FAMILY BREAKFAST
I'M PROPOSING THREE PLANKS
SO INSTEAD OF HAVING EXECUTIVES ISSUE GRAND PROCLAMATIONS THE TEAM IN EFFECT MANAGES ITSELF
BUT WE'RE GIVING THEM PRACTICE BECOMING INDEPENDENT WHICH OF COURSE IS OUR ULTIMATE GOAL
YOU HAVE CONSTANT FEEDBACK
IT'S LIKE THEY SAY IN THE INTERNET WORLD IF YOU'RE DOING THE SAME THING TODAY YOU WERE DOING SIX MONTHS AGO YOU'RE DOING THE WRONG THING
WHAT VALUES DO WE MOST UPHOLD
I TOLD DAVID KEEP YOUR WORK OUT OF MY KITCHEN
HE SAID IN THE WORKPLACE ADULTS LOVE IT
WE'LL MEET FOR A BEDTIME SNACK
ONE OF OUR DAUGHTERS HAD GOTTEN INTO A SPAT
ELEANOR TAKES CARE OF THEIR FOUR CHILDREN AGES 10 TO 15
YOU CAN TAKE THAT 10 MINUTES AND MOVE IT TO ANY PART OF THE DAY AND HAVE THE SAME BENEFIT
JUST WHEN THEY STOP NEEDING OUR HELP TAKING A BATH THEY NEED OUR HELP DEALING WITH CYBERSTALKING OR BULLYING
CHILDREN WHO PLAN THEIR OWN GOALS SET WEEKLY SCHEDULES EVALUATE THEIR OWN WORK
ACTUALLY I BURNED ONE SO I MADE TWO
AND HERE'S THE WORST NEWS OF ALL
WE HAD A PAJAMA PARTY
AND THE TRUTH IS RECENT RESEARCH BACKS HIM UP
DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOUR PARENTS WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL
PLANK NUMBER ONE ADAPT ALL THE TIME
JIM COLLINS THE AUTHOR OF GOOD TO GREAT TOLD ME THAT SUCCESSFUL HUMAN ORGANIZATIONS OF ANY KIND HAVE TWO THINGS IN COMMON
OUR CHILDREN SENSE WE'RE OUT OF CONTROL
EVERYONE THROWS OUT SUGGESTIONS AND THEN WE PICK TWO TO FOCUS ON
EVERY MINUTE ABOVE THAT WE HAVE TO DO ONE PUSHUP
SPEND TIME RETELLING THE STORY OF YOUR FAMILY'S POSITIVE MOMENTS AND HOW YOU OVERCAME THE
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT SHE SAID
YOU JUST HAD TEAMS OF HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE
AND YOU GO OUT THERE AND YOU SPEND MONEY ON AIRFARE AND YOU SPEND TIME AND YOU SPEND PER DIEM AND YOU
IT KIND OF FRIGHTENS ME TO THINK OF HOW LONG AGO THAT WAS
THE DEMAND FOR THIS THE NEED FOR DATA TO RUN BETTER PROGRAMS JUST WITHIN HEALTH NOT TO MENTION ALL OF THE
WE HAVE PAPER FORMS TO TRACK DRUG SUPPLIES BLOOD SUPPLIES ALL THESE DIFFERENT PAPER FORMS
NOW 1995 OBVIOUSLY THAT WAS QUITE A LONG TIME AGO
I NEED TO THINK ABOUT THIS MORE
IT'S ALWAYS GUYS THAT LOOK PRETTY MUCH LIKE ME FLYING FROM COUNTRIES THAT LOOK PRETTY MUCH LIKE THIS TO OTHER
AND THE MAIN OBSTACLE IT TURNED OUT AND THIS IS A SAD REALIZATION THE MAIN OBSTACLE WAS ME
WHILE I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT PEOPLE STARTED USING EVEN MORE THINGS LIKE THIS JUST AS WE WERE
NOW WE KNEW WHEN WE BUILT THIS SYSTEM THE WHOLE POINT OF IT JUST LIKE WITH THE PALMPILOTS WAS THAT YOU'D BE
AS FAR AS I KNEW THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD DISTRIBUTE TECHNOLOGY AND I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT A WAY AROUND IT
HOW WAS I TRAINING FOLKS AND WHAT WERE THE BOTTLENECKS AND WHAT WERE THE OBSTACLES TO DOING IT FASTER AND TO
AND UNFORTUNATELY AFTER THINKING ABOUT THIS FOR SOME TIME I IDENTIFIED THE MAIN OBSTACLE
AND SO I BEGAN TO RACK MY BRAIN TRYING TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WAS THE PROCESS THAT I WAS DOING
NOW TRY AND WRAP YOUR HEAD AROUND THAT FOR A SECOND
AND WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT IS ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT WE'RE GENERATING THROUGH OUR INTERACTION WITH AND OVER THE INTERNET
WE HAVE PAPER FORMS FOR VACCINATION SURVEYS
WE HAVE PAPER FORMS TO TRACK PEOPLE WHO COME INTO CLINICS
THAT'S LESS THAN I USED TO GET JUST TRAVELING OUT FOR TWO WEEKS TO DO A CONSULTATION
THEY ALL BECOME SPECIALIZED FOR THE TASK AT HAND
AND BY THIS AGE WE SEE A REMARKABLE EVOLUTION IN ITS CAPACITY TO CONTROL MOVEMENT
ALL IT TAKES FOR EXAMPLE IN THE SOUND DOMAIN IS EXPOSURE TO SOUND
FORTUNATELY WE HAVE MOORE'S LAW ON OUR SIDE SO MOORE'S LAW SAYS THAT COMPUTING POWER DOUBLES ROUGHLY EVERY TWO YEARS
THIS IS VERY EXCITING BECAUSE WHAT YOU ARE DOING HERE IS USING AN EXTERNAL PIECE OF TECHNOLOGY AN MRI SCANNER
IBM HAVE SIMULATED A 530 BILLION NEURON NETWORK WITH 10 TRILLION SYNAPSES
PEOPLE HAVE DONE IT WITH PAIN SO WE CAN TELL HOW MUCH PAIN PEOPLE ARE IN AT THE TIME OF THE SCAN
THC IS MORE OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF CANNABIS ANXIETY PARANOIA
SO THAT WAS VERY COOL
ACTUALLY WHAT THEY DID NEXT WAS MUCH COOLER
AH THANK YOU VERY MUCH
YOU KNOW SHE'S ONLY HALF JEWISH
BUT I DON'T MIND
THANK YOU FOR ALL THAT YOU DO
RIGHT NOW IT'S VERY EXCITING ACTUALLY FOR ME BECAUSE I'M THE JUNIOR ASSISTANT TO THE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR UNDER THE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR
AND SO I'VE BROUGHT A COUPLE OF THEM WITH ME
BUT WHEN THEY GOT OLDER WHEN THE TIME COMES FOR THEM TO START THINK ABOUT GETTING MARRIED
ANYWAY I AM HERE BECAUSE OF A YOUNG GIRL SARAH JONES
IT'S LIKE A RAINBOW
I LOVE HER TOO SHE'S WONDERFUL
OH GOLDIE HAWN
EVEN THOUGH QUITE FRANKLY SOME OF YOUR PRESENTATIONS ARE HORRIFYING ABSOLUTELY HORRIFYING
AND CONGRATULATIONS ON BEING SUCH BIG MAKHERS THAT YOU'VE BECOME TED
I MEAN I KNOW SOMETIMES OUR LIFESTYLES ARE VERY DIFFERENT WHATEVER
I NOTICED IT'S VERY MULTICULTURAL
AND THEN I THOUGHT NO NO
AND SHE WAS GETTING A YOGURT IN THE GOOGLE CAFE
AND THEY'VE INSPIRED MANY CHARACTERS AS WELL
SO IF YOU WILL INDULGE ME I WILL SHARE QUICKLY WITH YOU A BIT OF VERSE WHICH I
THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANY OTHER DOMINICAN PEOPLE HERE BUT I KNOW THAT JUAN ENRIQUEZ HE WAS HERE
AND I'M JUST TRYING NOT TO PANIC AND FREAK OUT
WELL MY CHARACTERS LIKE THE ONES IN MY SHOWS ALLOW ME TO PLAY WITH THE
AND I JUST I LOVE YOU GUYS
I DON'T TELL THEM WHO I AM
FOR ME I COME AT IT FROM INTUITION
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO HOMOGENIZE IT
THEY WON'T HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT
THAT WAS ERADICATED SO THAT GOT DOWN TO ZERO
TRADITION HERE WHICH IS THE STRONGEST IS THE ENVY OF THE WORLD
THEY BRING DOWN THE DROPOUT RATE
HE SAID I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GOING TO PAY FOR HER EDUCATION
THERE WAS A LOT WE DIDN'T KNOW
WE KEPT TRYING TO ENGAGE HER BUT SHE WAS SHY
PAIR OF KHAKIS
WELL WE GOT HUNDREDS OF IDEAS
I WAS ACTUALLY REALLY EXCITED
AND THEY START TO SEE OTHERS DOING IT AND SAYING WOW I WANT TO DO THAT WITH MY OWN MONEY
WE CAN SPEND AID SMARTER
MAYBE A FEW OF THOSE WILL WORK OUT
IT'S INCREDIBLE HOW PEOPLE THINK OKAY THAT COULD BE ME AND THE MONEY FLOWS
WE LOOK AND GO WOW
SO SHE KEPT WANTING TO TALK TO ME AND JENN
I GUESS THERE'S A LONG VERSION AND A SHORT VERSION OF THAT
BUT WE WERE STUNNED
CAN YOU GET A WOMAN TO ACCEPT THOSE POLIO DROPS IN HER CHILD'S MOUTH
IT WAS INCREDIBLE
PEOPLE GIVE TO SOME THINGS
BUT THE THING THAT WE LEARNED FROM THAT WORK AND WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE THE FUNDAMENTAL KEY IS A GREAT TEACHER IN FRONT
I CAN'T PAY FOR PRIVATE SCHOOL AND SHE MAY END UP ON THIS FARM LIKE MY WIFE
YOU JUST GO DOWN TO THE DRUG STORE
BILL HAD NEVER TAKEN THAT MUCH TIME OFF FROM WORK
WE STARTED ASKING OURSELVES QUESTIONS
BG WE HAD NEVER EXPECTED IT AND IT HAS BEEN UNBELIEVABLE
WERE THERE THINGS THAT WEREN'T BEING DONE
HOW ON EARTH DID THAT HAPPEN
THEY HAVE LESS VIOLENCE AND CRIME IN THOSE SCHOOLS
IT WAS IRONIC BECAUSE I WAS A GUY TALKING EVERYDAY ABOUT REDUCING PEOPLE'S RELIANCE ON DIESEL AWARDED
IT'S A WASTE OF RESOURCES IF YOU DON'T USE SOMEONE LIKE DAI MANJU
THEY SOLD THE MILK FOR CASH
AND I'LL JUST SAY TWO THINGS ABOUT THIS
THERE'S A BOOK CALLED DEAD AID
BUT IN MOST OF THE REST OF THE WORLD THAT'S NOT THE CASE
DO YOU THINK WE'LL MAKE IT
THE SECOND ITEM ON THE AGENDA IS MATERNAL MORTALITY
HEIFER SENT TWO GOATS TO AFRICA
SHE WAS BEATEN EVERY SINGLE DAY BY HER HUSBAND WHO WAS UNEMPLOYED
AID HELPING PEOPLE IS NOT EASY AND THERE HAVE BEEN BOOKS THAT HAVE CRITICIZED U
TURNS OUT THAT IT'S A FAILED IRRIGATION PROJECT
SHE ROCKETED TO THE TOP OF HER CLASS
TRANSPORTED FROM AFRICA TO THE NEW WORLD
AROUND THE WORLD ONE WOMAN DIES EVERY MINUTE AND A HALF FROM CHILDBIRTH
WHY SHOULD YOU CARE
SOMETIMES IT'S ALSO BECAUSE OF THE SONOGRAM
DAI MANJU WAS IN SIXTH GRADE WHEN HER PARENTS SAID WE'RE GOING TO PULL YOU OUT OF SCHOOL BECAUSE THE
SHE SCOUTED FOR JOBS DOWN IN GUANGDONG PROVINCE IN THE SOUTH
AND THAT BRINGS ME TO MY FIRST MAJOR OF TWO TENETS OF HALF THE SKY
YOU'RE PROBABLY ASKING THAT
I LIKE A LOT OF BLACK COLORS A LOT OF GRAYS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
NOW BATMAN I WILL ACCEPT
BATS ARE COOL
WHAT DO YOU HAVE THAT WE DON'T HAVE
LET'S TAKE SAP THE SOFTWARE COMPANY AS AN EXAMPLE
WE GOT QUITE SOME ATTENTION
AND BY EMBRACING DIVERSITY BY EMBRACING DIVERSE TALENT WE ARE PROVIDING TRUE OPPORTUNITY FOR
BUT IT'S DOABLE AND THERE ARE MANY COMPANIES TODAY THAT ARE MAKING PROGRESS THERE AND DOING IT SUCCESSFULLY
TO MEASURE THE FIRST ONE WE ASKED THEM ABOUT INNOVATION REVENUE
IT WAS SOMETHING AN OLDER GENERATION HAD TO FIGHT FOR
WHICH WAY IS IT
NO OTHER ANIMAL COOKS ITS FOOD
MAYBE THE PROBLEM WAS WITH THE BASIC ASSUMPTION THAT ALL BRAINS ARE MADE IN THE SAME WAY
ONLY HUMANS DO
MAYBE THE HUMAN BRAIN ACTUALLY HAS THE MOST NEURONS OF ANY BRAIN REGARDLESS OF ITS SIZE
SO THIS IS A FIRST INDICATION THAT THE ALL BRAINS ARE MADE THE SAME WAY SCENARIO IS NOT QUITE RIGHT
BUT LET'S PLAY ALONG
AND HERE COMES THE BAD NEWS OUR BRAIN NOT THE LARGEST ONE AROUND
AND THAT WAS
OR I WOULD BUT I JUST DON T HAVE THE SKILLSET
SO IF YOU RE WAITING I M SORRY TO SAY YOU'RE GOING TO WAIT A LOT LONGER
ESPECIALLY FOR SOMEONE LIKE MYSELF WHO HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF WORKING AT HOME ON A DAILY BASIS MORE OFTEN THAN NOT
AND THIS REALIZATION CAME OVER ME
A GOOD EXAMPLE IS THIS
AND HERE S THE THING ABOUT THAT
IT WASN T UNTIL I STARTED WORKING ON A CAMPAIGN THAT I HAD A REALIZATION OF OTHERWISE
I WOULD SAY THINGS LIKE OH I LL GET TO IT ONE DAY
I HAD NO IDEA WHAT THE HELL I WAS DOING
I STARTED LEARNING MARKETING TACTICS AND STRATEGIES THAT WAY
1 HAS TO BE LISTENING
SO THE PRIORITY NO
THAT S ACTUALLY HOW I GOT STARTED WITH MY CAREER
AND THAT S THE TIME LIMITATION
IT S NOT THAT I AM MY GREATEST OPPOSITION I M ALSO MY GREATEST ALLY
SO FOR ME I WOULD USE THE PROCRASTINATION LIMITATION
BUT HERE S THE THING
IF YOU WANT SOMETHING IN LIFE YOU HAVE TO RISK IT TO GET THE BISCUIT
WHEN IN ACTUALITY IT S NOT ABOUT THE RESOURCES YOU HAVE IT S ABOUT THE RESOURCEFULNESS OF YOU AS AN INDIVIDUAL
IT WAS SIMPLY THIS
YOU DON T EITHER AND THAT S OKAY
THEN AFTER MONTHS AND MONTHS OF GOING BACK AND FORTH WITH THEM THROUGH EMAIL GIVING THEM FREE WRITING CONTENT
WE SAY OH I HAVE A JOB I HAVE KIDS I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND I HAVE SCHOOL THERE S JUST NOT ENOUGH TIME IN THE DAY TO DO
THERE ARE SEVEN DAYS IN A WEEK AND SOMEDAY ISN T ONE OF THEM
BUT RIGHT BEFORE THE CAMPAIGN LAUNCHED MY BOSS RECOMMENDED THAT WE TRY SOME AD VARIATIONS THAT WERE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN THE
AND TO LEAVE YOU WITH A QUOTE FROM THE POEM INVICTUS
BUT ALL KIDDING ASIDE IN MY LINE OF WORK WHAT I GET TO WORK WITH IS DATA ANALYTICS STATISTICS AND AD VARIATIONS
IT LL SELDOM FALL ON YOUR LAP THROUGHOUT YOUR LIFETIME
LET S TAKE A LOOK AT A FUN EXAMPLE HERE
IS THIS WHERE YOU WANT TO BE
MY PARENTS WERE TOTALLY STRESSED OUT ABOUT ME GOING AND AUDITIONING AND
I WENT TO SEE THIS SPECIALIST AND SHE WAS TOP OF THE FIELD AND TOLD ME I HAD TO STOP
IT'S A MILE HIGH AND I GREW UP THERE WITH MY 10 BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND TWO ADORING PARENTS
I KNEW ANOTHER YOUNG MAN THOUGH WHO HAD PH WHO DIED WHILE WAITING FOR ONE
THE SAME THING HAPPENS WITH LIGHT
THIS IMAGE IS ALSO BLACK AND WHITE SO WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT IS THE COLOR OF EVERYTHING IN HERE
I WANTED TO SEEK OUT NEW LIFE
EVERYWHERE IT PERVADES US LIKE THE FORCE
AND I'M VERY EXCITED
WE KNOW THAT THERE MUST BE A LOT OF HIGH ENERGY ELECTRONS IN THE PLANE TO PRODUCE THE SYNCHROTRON
WELL VERY WELL SO WE'VE SEEN ONE RADIO GALAXY
I WANTED TO SEE EVERYTHING THAT THE UNIVERSE HAD TO OFFER
IT'S POSSIBLE TO DO BETTER
THE DUST STOPS THE VISIBLE LIGHT FROM GETTING TO US
THE DUST STOPS IT GETTING TO US
THEY'RE NOT SEEN AS FOREIGN
UNTIL RECENTLY THERE WAS NO REASON TO THINK THAT THESE ANIMALS WERE IN ANY WAY THREATENED
IN THAT RECIPIENT ANIMAL
BECAUSE IN FACT THE MHCS ARE IDENTICAL
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THOSE THREE AS
WE'VE GOT FASHION MAGAZINES HOUSE PARTY SCENES
I WOULD IMAGINE THAT YOU'D HAVE TO BE PRETTY AWARE OF YOUR SURROUNDINGS AND APPRECIATING THE SMALL WONDERS THAT YOU'RE STARTING TO
WE TALKED ABOUT THE TV SHOW WE WATCHED THAT EVENING
WE WILL ALL HAVE HIGH HIGHS AND BIG DAYS AND PROUD MOMENTS OF SMILES ON GRADUATION STAGES
WE'VE GOT AIRPLANES HIGHWAY LANES INTERIOR DESIGN AND HOROSCOPE SIGNS
I MEAN WE'RE THE ONLY ONES WITH ARCHITECTURE AND AGRICULTURE
WE'VE GOT BOOKS BUFFETS AND RADIO WAVES WEDDING BRIDES AND ROLLERCOASTER RIDES
AND SO WE'D BUY THE DATE AND WE'D GO HOME
THERE'S JUST SO MANY THINGS TO BE HAPPY ABOUT
VERY SADLY HE TOOK HIS OWN LIFE
WE GREW UP AND WE GREW OLDER
LIFE WAS PRETTY GOOD
I SPOKE TO HIM ON THE PHONE AT 1030 P
WE FIND PATTERNS AND WE REPRESENT THEM
I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT HOW AMAZING REPRESENTING SOMETHING ACTUALLY IS
AND I THINK THIS IS A NICE DAY TO DAY DEFINITION
TRY TO CHANGE YOUR PERSPECTIVE
OK SO WHY AM I DOING ALL THIS
LET'S DO ANOTHER EXPERIMENT
IT'S THE VOLUME OF THE SPHERE
SO THAT IS MY CLAIM
AND I WOULD GO AS FAR AS TO SAY THAT EVERY EQUATION IS LIKE THIS EVERY MATHEMATICAL EQUATION WHERE YOU
WE CAN EVEN WRITE IT SIMPLY LIKE 1
MY CLAIM IS THAT UNDERSTANDING HAS TO DO WITH THE ABILITY TO CHANGE YOUR PERSPECTIVE
NOT JUST YOUR TEXTS AND TWEETS BUT INCREASINGLY YOUR SPOKEN WORDS AS WELL
GO BUY A FRIEND A PRESENT AND COME BACK IN 3 HOURS
THE QUESTION THEN
AND COMMUNITIES ARE TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT
SO LET'S START WITH HIGH EXTROVERSION
THAT'S COMPARABLE TO NOT SMOKING
BUT AS I SEARCHED AROUND IN THE DARKNESS I REALIZED I WAS ACTUALLY PARALYZED BY ALL OF THE CHOICES THAT I
THESE NEEDS MUST BE PRIORITIZED BY NGO WORKERS POLICY MAKERS THE WHO
DESPITE ALL THESE CHALLENGES THEY FACED THEY WERE TRYING TO HELP THEIR CHILDREN
WE MUST PRIORITIZE THESE FAMILIES' NEEDS BOTH THOSE WHO ARE INTERNALLY DISPLACED AND THOSE WHO ARE
SO ACTUALLY CHILDREN CAN BE PROTECTED BY WARM SECURE PARENTING
THEY WATCHED THEIR CHILDREN CHANGE AND THEY HAD NO IDEA HOW TO HELP THEM
THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO ANSWER THEIR CHILDREN'S QUESTIONS
WE NEED A PLAN THAT ADDS UP
WE LOVE BACK OF ENVELOPE CALCULATIONS
I'VE TRIED IT
I AM THE DAUGHTER OF TWO HARDWORKING COLLEGE EDUCATED AFRICAN AMERICAN PARENTS WHO CHOSE
WE KEEP FOCUSING ON THE END RESULTS OR TEST RESULTS AND GETTING FRUSTRATED
WHY DOESN'T EVERYONE GET THIS
AND THEN I'D REPLY STRANGERS FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY WANTED YOU TO HAVE THESE
WHAT IS A SCIENTIST WITH NO LABORATORY
WHAT IS AN ACTRESS WITH NO STAGE
WE GET TO A CATASTROPHE AND WE WONDER HOW DID IT GET SO BAD
EQUAL AND EQUITABLE
ALL OF MY NEIGHBORHOOD FRIENDS WERE EXPERIENCING AN EDUCATIONAL TRAIN WRECK THAT I WAS
BUT AS I GOT OLDER I STARTED NOTICING THINGS LIKE
HOW COME MY NEIGHBORHOOD FRIEND DON'T HAVE TO WAKE UP AT FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND GO TO A SCHOOL THAT'S AN HOUR
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF OTHER KIDS JUST LIKE ME WHO DESERVE THIS TOO
HOW TO MAKE IT HAPPEN
BUT I WILL ALSO ASK THE QUESTION
AND SO YOU CAN SAY
AND THIS BIG PROMISE HAS DRIVEN MANKIND FOR 50 YEARS ALREADY TO EXPLORE HOW IT CAN WORK
I THINK THAT WILL BE A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH AND THEN WE HAVE A NEW PRIMARY ENERGY SOURCE AND I SHOULD
AND THE ANSWER IS NO BY NO MEANS
THE MACHINE RUNS PERFECTLY FINE
THAT'S OF COURSE A BIG BIG PROMISE
IT'S A CONVERSION OF MASS INTO ENERGY AND THAT'S EINSTEIN'S FAMOUS FORMULA E MC
AND THIS ENERGY IS RELEASED JUST BY SPEED BY KINETIC ENERGY BY HEAT IN OTHER
AND SO THAT'S A FANTASTIC FUEL
AND ONCE WE UNDERSTAND THEM WE WILL FINALLY UNDERSTAND OURSELVES
I THINK HE HAD A WEALTH OF ABOUT 40 MILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS A BILLION DOLLARS TODAY
AND I AM SO AFRAID OF WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN MY FUTURE
BECAUSE IT IS THEIR HARD WORK THEIR COURAGE AND THAT DOOR WAS OPEN FOR THEM
WHERE DO THEY COME FROM
I'M AFRAID THAT IT'S NOW GOING TO BE TAKEN AWAY
HER NAME WAS ANNA
AND HE WAS AN IRISH IMMIGRANT
IT IS NOT LOST ON ME EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT I GET UP AND I WALK INTO MY
AND THEN MY PARENTS WERE THE SAME WAY
THEY DIDN'T GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE
THE PAPER OFFERED AN ALTERNATE STORY OF AUTISM
HE ONCE BRAGGED THAT HE HAD TURNED NINE OUT OF 10 KIDS REFERRED TO HIS OFFICE AS AUTISTIC BY OTHER
THESE CHANGES WEREN'T HAPPENING IN A VACUUM
IF THE DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA HAD TO BE BROADENED WHY WERE THEY SO NARROW IN THE FIRST PLACE
WHY WERE CASES OF AUTISM SO HARD TO FIND BEFORE THE 1990S
ONE OF THE TRAGIC THINGS ABOUT THIS OUTBREAK IS THAT MEASLES WHICH CAN BE FATAL TO A
WE NEED TO REMOVE IT FROM THAT MYSTERIOUS PLACE IT SEEMS TO EXIST AND SETTLE IT MORE CLEARLY
AND WHILE IT DOES MOST OF THE TIME SOMETIMES IT DOES NOT AND WE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT
I ONLY GOT THREE MINUTES TO PREPARE THIS SO DON'T BE ALL SMUG WHEN I MAKE A MISTAKE
BUT THE BEST TED TALKERS WILL NEVER BREAK
THAT'S A FAVORITE
ROLLED OFF MY TONGUE
I WILL SIT HERE ON THE OUTSIDE OF YOUR CHURCH WAITING FOR YOU TO PUT THIS MARBLE SINNER INSIDE OF YOUR CHURCH
I AM YOUR ARCHANGEL WITHOUT A HALO
IS THAT WHY YOU DON'T HOLD ME ANYMORE FATHER
CAN YOU BREATHE NOW
AND I'VE REACHED THE END OF MY CONFESSIONS
THEY'RE LIKE WE ARE GONNA GIVE YOU A SCHOLARSHIP TO ATTEND A LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN THE FALL
THESE GIRLS HAD STORIES
STORIES OF OVERCOMING HUGE ODD STORIES OF BEING 14 15 16 YEARS OLD AND WAKING UP ONE DAY AND SAY YOU KNOW
MY LIFE IS A MESS BUT I'M GONNA DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT
A YEAR AGO I HAD THE CHANCE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM FOR ENTREPRENEURS AT THE SINGULARITY
HELP A BILLION PEOPLE
A FEW WEEKS AGO A GUY FROM A BERLIN BASED COMPANY CALLED ME TRYING TO SELL ME A BUSINESS
BEFORE THEY WERE WALKING UP TO 10KM A DAY FOR WATER
AND NOW THAT A COMMUNITY PROJECT THERE A GRASSROOTS PROJECT HAS PROVIDED THEM WITH
IT'S TOTALLY OVERWHELMING
HOW DO YOU COPE WITH THAT
AND SO HOW AM I GONNA FIT ONE MORE THING AND SOMETHING I AM NOT EVEN AN EXPERT IN
IF SOMEONE DESCRIBES THEMSELVES AS GENDER QUEER TO YOU YOU CAN SAY GENDER QUEER
SO SHE DECIDED TO GET COMFORTABLE
ONE IS TO ASK OPEN ENDED QUESTIONS
NOW SOME OF OUR VOLUNTEERS ARE RELIGIOUS BUT THIS PARTICULAR ONE WAS NOT
HOW WOULD I KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT DECISION WAS
WHAT WAS THAT LIKE
ABORTION IS COMMON
AN ARE YOU WITH US OR AGAINST US
THAT SOUNDS PRETTY NICE
THIS IS REALLY GONNA WORK
AND THAT'S THE CASE FOR MOST PEOPLE NOWADAYS
BUT THE BIGGEST THING I LEARNED IS YOU HAVE TO DO THE RIGHT KIND OF MARKET RESEARCH OKAY
AND IT'S A VERY SIMPLE THING TO DO
IT'S FANTASTIC GO FOR IT
THAT CAN BE A FASHION STATEMENT OR IT CAN BE A STATEMENT ABOUT THE KIND OF MUSIC THEY ARE INTO OR PERHAPS A STATEMENT ABOUT HOW MUCH
I DO SOMETIMES BUT IT'S VERY RARE I NORMALLY USE MY MOBILE PHONE OR MY LAPTOP OR
I DON'T REALLY USE MY WATCH TO TELL THE TIME
THEY WANT SOMETHING THAT MAKES A STATEMENT
WE HAVE THIS VERY LITERAL WAY OF THINKING OF WHEN I DO CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WORK I DO IT FOR CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY
AND THAT CAN BE MONEY OF COURSE IT CAN BE MONEY
I THOUGHT THIS IS GREAT
IN CASE THIS IS ONE OF THOSE BIG GRAND STATEMENTS THAT WE USED TO HEAR WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER
IT'S HUMAN NATURE RIGHT
SO IT JUST MAKES SENSE THAT THE MORE PEOPLE YOU KNOW THE MORE CHANCE YOU HAVE OF YOUR NAME BEING IN THAT KIND OF
AM I GOING TO TALK ABOUT MY RESEARCH MY POSTDOC
WHAT AM I GOING TO TALK ABOUT
I GOT INTO IT VERY SURPRISINGLY AND VERY INVOLUNTARILY
THERE WAS A SECOND GRADE CLASS WHO HAD BRAND NEW IPADS AND WE POLITICIANS
THIS IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL CONCEPT
NOT BECAUSE I REGRET ANYTHING OF WHAT I WROTE AND SAID NOT BECAUSE I FELT OR FEEL
BUT THEN I READ THE TED GUIDELINES AND THEY SAID WE ARE LOOKING FOR SPEAKERS TO SHARE DEEP
I KNOW THIS IS STUFF YOU AREN'T SUPPOSED TO SAY IN THIS COUNTRY WHERE EVERYONE LEARNS EVERYTHING AND ALL THE PEOPLE ARE FRIENDS WITH
I WAS VISITING THIS SCHOOL IN MAY AS A LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER I'M A FORMER LIBERAL
I'M A FEMINIST LIKE I TOLD YOU AND I THINK PERSONAL IS POLITICAL
MY STORY IS PERSONAL BUT IT'S ALSO POLITICAL
IT'S NOT POLITICAL MERELY BECAUSE IT'S PERSONAL I THINK IT WOULD BE POLITICAL ANYWAY
WE OFFER HIGH QUALITY YEAR ROUND SPORTS PROGRAMS FOR PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
PUT SOME ELECTRONICS BEHIND IT YOU GOT YOURSELF A RAIN GAUGE
IT DOESN'T COMPLY WITH THE WHOLE ROBUST THING I JUST SAID
IT'S IN YOUR SOUP
PRIMARY SUGAR IN IT
I'VE GOT TWO KIDS I MENTIONED SAWYER AND AVERY
AND ONCE UPON A TIME I THINK I WAS TREATING MY SAWYER AND AVERY LIKE LITTLE BONSAI
IN FACT I'M NOT VERY INTERESTED IN PARENTING PER SE
YOU GOTTA SAY WHAT WAS GREAT ABOUT LUNCH TODAY
THEY NEED TO KNOW THEY MATTER TO US AS HUMANS NOT BECAUSE OF THEIR GPA
AND IF YOU'RE A CANDIDATE DON'T WAIT FOR AN EMPLOYER TO ASK
WE NEED EMPLOYERS TO LET GO OF OUTDATED HIRING PRACTICES AND EMBRACE NEW WAYS OF IDENTIFYING AND
THE HIRING SYSTEMS WE BUILT IN THE 20TH CENTURY ARE FAILING US AND CAUSING US TO MISS OUT ON PEOPLE WITH INCREDIBLE
BASEBALL WAS TRANSFORMED WHEN THE CASH STRAPPED OAKLAND ATHLETICS STARTED RECRUITING PLAYERS WHO DIDN'T SCORE HIGHLY ON
OUR CLIENTS ARE BENEFITING FROM 85 YEARS OF EMPLOYMENT RESEARCH WHICH SHOWS THAT WORK SAMPLES ARE ONE OF THE BEST
I HAD BOTH A MAN AND A WOMAN ASK ME FOR A RAISE AT THE SAME TIME SO I WAS CONFRONTED WITH MY DIFFERENT REACTIONS
BUT I'VE REALIZED WE DON'T NEED TO
IT COULD VERY WELL BE
HOW DID THEY COPE WITH SUCH LITTLE STORAGE SPACE
YOU'RE GOING TO BE MORE DISCERNING
SO I OBSERVED MADAME CHIC OF COURSE I OBSERVED THE OTHER MOTHERS ON THE STUDY ABROAD PROGRAM I OBSERVED
I DECIDED TO OBSERVE THEM
THEY WEREN'T EXPENSIVE BUT THEY WERE THE NICEST PYJAMAS I'D EVER OWNED AS AN ADULT BECAUSE THEY WERE ACTUALLY MEANT TO
SO EXTRAS CAN BE THINGS LIKE T SHIRTS SWEATERS OBVIOUSLY IF YOU LIVE IN A COLD CLIMATE YOU'LL NEED LOTS OF LAYERING
YOU'RE THINKING THERE'S NO WAY
IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES I REALIZED I COULD RESPECT MYSELF ENOUGH TO PRESENT MYSELF BEAUTIFULLY AT ALL
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE PRONE TO IMPULSE BUYS ANYMORE
AND THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS NO OF COURSE NOT
MEN YOU HAVE LESS CHOICE IT'S EASIER FOR YOU
I FELT SO BAD FOR THESE FRENCH PEOPLE
SO WE ARE MORE PRONE TO IMPULSE BUYS
AND IT WASN'T A CLOSET LIKE I WAS USED TO BACK IN CALIFORNIA
AND IT TURNS OUT THEY DID
BUT PEOPLE LIKE ME THE PROFESSIONAL TROUBLEMAKERS SHOULD NOT BE THE ONLY ONES WHO ARE COMMITTED TO BEING THESE DOMINOES WHO ARE ALWAYS FALLING OUT OF
AND THAT SAME SEMESTER I STARTED BLOGGING
I WENT ZIPLINING THROUGH THE FORESTS OF PUNTA CANA
WE SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE JUSTICE
BUT IT HAD HAPPENED TO BE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT WITH ME
I DIDN'T EVEN THINK I COULD MAKE IT TO MY 18TH BIRTHDAY
WE PLACED HIGH VALUE ON IT
WAS IT ONE THING IN PARTICULAR
AND WE DID A SURGERY AND HE WENT HOME WITH THREE WEEKS OF AGE PARENTS WERE DELIGHTED EVERYTHING WAS A SUCCESS
WAS IT ONE LECTURE
NOW IT MAY BE SUNSETS IT MAY BE A SPORTING HERO IT MAY BE A PIECE OF MUSIC IT
AND I THOUGHT WELL WHAT AM I INTERESTED IN
WHY DID YOU COME
AND THEN THE DOCTOR SAID TO ME BUT THERE'S SOMETHING YOU NEED TO KNOW
IN 2004 I HAD A BABY BOY TRANSFERRED TO MY CARE WITH HIRSCHSPRUNG'S DISEASE
AND THE FIRST THING WE DO WHEN WE COME ACROSS A VICTIM OF TRAUMA IS WE ASSESS THEM FOR BREATHING
AND THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE INSPIRATION DOES FOR US
THE DOCTOR ON THE PHONE SAID THERE'S ONE PROBLEM
AND THEN THE LITTLE BOY SAID TO ME WHAT ARE YOU WRITING
AND THAT'S PRETTY INSPIRATIONAL I HAVE TO SAY
BUT ACTUALLY WHY WAS I GOING TO TEDX
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SPEAK ON
I SAID YES THAT'D BE REALLY NICE
AND HE WROTE BACK AND SAID SO WHAT ARE YOU SPEAKING ON
THERE ARE MANY THERAPEUTIC APPLICATIONS OF KETONES BECAUSE NEARLY ALL HEALTHY CELLS IN A BODY
WHAT'S MOST INTERESTING IS THAT THE SAME LEVEL OF OXYGEN THAT DAMAGED THE CANCER CELLS WAS
SO THEY START SHOULD WE CALL THE AMBULANCE
UPON TRAVELING TO ITALY TO WORK ON MY PH
SHOULD WE RUN
AND I ANSWERED WHY SHOULD I CARE ABOUT HIS RELIGION IF MY PH
I'M A WOMEN THANKS TO GOD
EXACTLY AS WE'RE DOING NOW
ON MY WAY TO SESAME I BROKE THAT RULE AND LEFT IT AT HOME BECAUSE I KNOW THAT IN SESAME MY
HE QUESTIONED HOW I WAS GOING TO MAKE IT
BUT IN ACTUALITY OUR SCHOOL GOT A FAB LAB THROUGH A GRANT PROVIDED BY
THEY DON'T HAVE TIME TO RELAX
WOULD WE SEE 544 AIRLINE PILOTS HELD CAPTIVE IN THEIR JUMBO JETS ON A
THIS IS A PICTURE OF THE NEAREST LARGE GALAXY TO US THE ANDROMEDA GALAXY
STARS ARE AMAZING THINGS
WE CAN LOOK BACK TO A TIME WHEN THERE WAS NOTHING BUT HYDROGEN GAS
I RESPONDED TO THE STORY AND TO THE DRAMA OF IT ALL
MY ATOMS COME TOGETHER FOR A LITTLE WHILE
WE LIVE IN A GALAXY VERY MUCH LIKE THIS CALLED THE MILKY WAY
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW BEAUTIFUL THIS IS THE SYSTEM THAT I'M A PART OF
7 BILLION YEARS AGO IT'S VERY DIFFERENT INDEED
STARS LIKE THE SUN UNRAVEL GENTLY BACK INTO SPACE
THE STAR GETS ENERGY OUT OF THAT AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE STAR SHINE
WHAT HAPPENED TO CHANGE THE UNIVERSE THIS WAY
I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT STORY BECAUSE I NEVER RESPONDED TO SCIENCE JUST AS THE MATHEMATICS JUST AS THE
WE COME FROM THE STARS LITERALLY
THERE ARE TIMES WHEN I FEEL SUCH EXULTANT JOY
YOU CAN BARELY SEE IT
THE UNIVERSE IS SOMEHOW VERY DIFFERENT
SO WHAT HAPPENED
IT'S NOT JUST A SINGLE STAR EITHER
THERE'S NEVER BEEN SOMETHING QUITE LIKE ME OR LIKE YOU
RIGHT NOW THIS ROOM AND THIS PLANET AND THIS WHOLE SOLAR SYSTEM IS MOVING AT ABOUT HALF A
GALAXIES ARE INCREDIBLY HUGE
IF YOU GO AT THAT SPEED FOR ONE YEAR YOU COVER ABOUT 6 TRILLION MILES
100000 TIMES 6 TRILLION MILES
IT'S RIGHT HERE INSIDE YOU
BUT THERE'D BE NO WAY TO ACTUALLY ADD THOSE SOUNDS IN THE MIDDLE OF A PERFORMANCE
SO THE WAY THAT THIS WORKS IS THE KINNECT IS USING INFRA RED TO SEE EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENING IN FRONT OF IT
AND WHILE I'VE BEEN IMPROVISING AND PLAYING I THINK TO MYSELF
AND THAT'S THE BASIS ON WHICH YOU DECIDE WHOM TO VOTE FOR BUT AFTER HAVING FINISHED YOUR BIRTHDAY CAKE
NOW I'M NOT SAYING THAT DEALING WITH THE MEDIA ISN'T THE CAPABILITY A POLITICIAN SHOULD HAVE NOWADAYS
KIND REGARDS BEA
IT SIMPLY CANNOT BE CAMPAIGN DAY EVERY DAY
THEY THOUGHT THE STORY WAS GOING TO GET OUT
SO I HAD TO BASICALLY SPEND THE LAST WEEK CALMING EVERYONE DOWN A BIT LIKE A GENERAL WHERE YOU'RE HOLDING YOUR TROOPS BACK
NOW WHEN YOU'RE AN INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER AND YOU MAKE AN AMAZING DISCOVERY SUCH AS YOUR PRIME MINSTER CAN BE LINKED TO A
YOU CAN IMAGINE THE AMOUNT OF TIME THEY'D SPENT THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES MONEY SPENT ON THIS
WE HAD TO CALM THEM DOWN
ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH CRISES ARE GLOBAL
THEY ALL NEEDED TO BE HOUSED IN A SAFE AND SECURE LOCATION IN THE CLOUD
NATIVE EYES ON NATIVE NAMES WE CALLED IT THE IDEA BEING WHO BEST TO TELL YOU WHO WAS IMPORTANT TO
AND THERE ARE STRENGTHS IN ISLAMIC TRADITION
ARAB MASSES JUST REVOLTED AGAINST THEIR DICTATORS
SIMILARLY IN THE ARAB WORLD THERE WAS WHAT THE GREAT ARAB HISTORIAN ALBERT HOURANI DEFINES AS THE
AND QUITE TELLINGLY SOME MUSLIMS DO PRACTICE IT THE MUSLIMS IN NORTH AFRICA NOT IN OTHER PLACES
THAT'S WHY THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE IN ITS LAST DECADES TURNED INTO A PROTO DEMOCRACY A
THEY SEE AN EXAMPLE AT LEAST TO TAKE SOME INSPIRATION FROM
TURKEY HAS NEVER BEEN COLONIZED SO IT REMAINED AS AN INDEPENDENT NATION AFTER THE FALL OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE
THEY SAID WE WANT FREEDOM WE WANT DEMOCRACY
IN MY BOOK I WENT INTO THAT QUESTION AS WELL
SO IN THE 20TH CENTURY YOU HAD THIS VICIOUS CYCLE IN THE ARAB WORLD WHERE YOU HAVE A DICTATORSHIP SUPPRESSING ITS OWN
AND I THINK FORCING PEOPLE TO UNCOVER THEIR HEAD IS AS TYRANNICAL AS FORCING THEM TO COVER IT
QUITE QUITE IRONIC
AND I THINK IT'S NOT AN ACCIDENT THAT YOU DON'T FIND THIS IDEA IN THE VERY ORIGIN OF ISLAM
MAYBE SOME THINGS ARE BAD TRADITIONS AND THEY NEED TO BE CHANGED
WE WANT TO PUT IT OUT IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND WE WANT IT TO BE POWERED BY THE SUN
AND WE DON'T USE DESIGN ANYMORE
WE FIND WHAT WORKS
WHAT IF THAT WERE THE RISK SHE TOOK EVERYDAY JUST WALKING TO SCHOOL
WOULD WE BE WILLING TO STAND UP FOR THE THOUSANDS OF GIRLS AROUND THE WORLD THAT RISK THEIR
SHE HERSELF WAS A FIERCE VOICE AND A POWERFUL FIGURE THAT FOUGHT NOT JUST FOR WOMEN BUT ALSO
WE TELL VERY CONVINCING STORIES WE SLIGHTLY SHRUG OUR SHOULDERS
NOW HERE'S THE DEAL
WE ALL CHATTER WITH OUR FINGERTIPS
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN A DEAD GIVEAWAY FOR ANY LIESPOTTER THAT KNOWS THAT QUALIFYING LANGUAGE AS IT'S CALLED QUALIFYING LANGUAGE LIKE THAT
THEY'RE GOING TO BE ENTHUSIASTIC
WE CAN'T BELIEVE HOW PREVALENT LYING IS
WE'RE ESSENTIALLY AGAINST LYING
AND WE TAILOR THE CLASS TOWARDS THE AVERAGE
AND INTO THE SILENCE I SAID I'D BE HAPPY TO SPEAK AT YOUR SCHOOL BUT THAT'S NOT A WELLNESS WEEK THAT'S A SICKNESS WEEK
WHATEVER IT IS INSTEAD OF DELETING YOU WHAT I WANT TO DO IS STUDY YOU
AND IF HAPPINESS IS ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF SUCCESS YOUR BRAIN NEVER GETS THERE
DID YOU SEE HOW YOU LANDED
THAT UNDERGIRDS MOST OF OUR PARENTING AND MANAGING STYLES THE WAY THAT WE MOTIVATE OUR BEHAVIOR
SILENCE ON THE PHONE
AND FRIDAY NIGHT WE'RE TRYING TO DECIDE BETWEEN RISKY SEX OR HAPPINESS
YOU GOT GOOD GRADES NOW YOU HAVE TO GET BETTER GRADES YOU GOT INTO A GOOD SCHOOL AND AFTER YOU GET INTO A BETTER ONE YOU GOT A GOOD JOB NOW YOU HAVE
WE GET PEOPLE WHEN THEY OPEN UP THEIR INBOX TO WRITE ONE POSITIVE EMAIL PRAISING OR THANKING SOMEBODY IN THEIR SUPPORT NETWORK
AND WE'RE SO EXCITED
YOU'VE OUTLINED ALL THE NEGATIVE THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN BUT NOT TALKED ABOUT THE POSITIVE
EMBEDDED WITHIN THAT QUESTION IS THE KEY TO UNDERSTANDING THE SCIENCE OF HAPPINESS
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
AND WE KNOW THAT'S A MEASUREMENT ERROR BECAUSE IT'S MESSING UP MY DATA
I NERVOUSLY PEERED OVER THE SIDE OF THE BED TO SEE WHAT HAD BEFALLEN MY FALLEN SISTER AND SAW THAT SHE HAD LANDED PAINFULLY ON HER
SO I DID THE ONLY THING MY FRANTIC SEVEN YEAR OLD BRAIN COULD THINK TO DO TO AVERT THIS TRAGEDY
AND IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN YOU'VE SEEN THIS HUNDREDS OF TIMES
AND BY DOING THESE ACTIVITIES AND BY TRAINING YOUR BRAIN JUST LIKE WE TRAIN OUR BODIES WHAT WE'VE FOUND IS WE CAN REVERSE THE FORMULA FOR
WE DON'T HAVE TO GUESS OR USE OUR GUTS WE CAN USE SOCIAL SCIENCE
AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO TOUCH PEOPLE
I THINK THAT'S A CHALLENGE FOR BOTH THE HUMANITARIAN ACTORS AND PEOPLE FROM THE MEDIA PEOPLE LIKE ME
SO THIS GOES BACK TO MY FIRST QUESTION
ILLUSTRATIONS CAN BE TOUCHING
AND GRANDMA MOSES GOD LOVE HER DIDN'T START PAINTING UNTIL SHE WAS 76 YEARS OLD PROVING THAT THERE IS HOPE FOR
SO LET'S CELEBRATE LIFE
OUR VIEWS AND OUR ATTITUDES ABOUT AGING ARE MAJOR INDICATORS OF HOW WE'LL
I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT NEITHER OF THESE LADIES ARE SITTING AT HOME IN THEIR ROCKING CHAIR WAITING TO
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO I'VE SNAGGED ONE OF THE LAST TICKETS TO SEE WILLIE NELSON PERFORM AT THE EISENMAN
THE PAIN HAD SPREAD FROM HER WRIST TO HER HANDS TO HER FINGERTIPS FROM HER WRIST UP TO HER ELBOW
IN FACT IMAGINE SOMETHING EVEN WORSE
AND WHEN YOU TURN THE SWITCH ON THE LIGHT GOES ON
IMAGINE I WERE TO STROKE YOUR CHILD'S ARM WITH THIS FEATHER AND THEIR BRAIN WAS TELLING THEM THAT THEY WERE
NOW WHAT DOES IT HAVE TO DO WITH CHRONIC PAIN
IMAGINE IF YOU WILL THESE TWO IDEAS TOGETHER
IMAGINE WHAT YOUR LIFE WOULD BE LIKE IF I WERE TO STROKE IT WITH THIS FEATHER BUT YOUR BRAIN WAS
IT SOUNDED WONDERFUL THIS NOT HAVING TO READ IN ORDER TO PLAY MUSIC
SO I TRIED A FEW THINGS
FOR YEARS ECONOMIC JUSTICE HAS BEEN EVOLVING TO SEEK OUT NEW WAYS TO BRING TOGETHER THE GLOBAL WORLD
WE HAVE ACCESS TO AN UNPARALLELED AMOUNT OF INFORMATION AT EVERY MOMENT OF
INDENTURED SERVANTS WERE BROUGHT HERE FROM EUROPE
HUMANISTIC FEATS OF INTELLIGENCE BROUGHT TO US THE INTERNET
KING AND LET US CHANGE OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ECONOMY
SO BECAUSE OF THE SHARING ECONOMY ORGAN DONORSHIP INCREASED
KEEP THE WORDS OF DR
WE RE TOLD OUR VALUE THROUGH OUR CLOTHING SIZE OUR NUMERICAL AGE
A RESEARCH TEAM THAT I HAD THE PRIVILEGE TO BE A PART OF SOUGHT TO DETAIL THE EVOLUTION IN A SOCIETAL RELATIONSHIP
KING WAS ASKING US TO THINK OF THE LARGER STRUCTURE OF THE WORLD AND HOW IT IS BEING CONSTRUCTED
YOUR PITUITARY GLAND PUMPS THIS STUFF OUT AS PART OF THE STRESS RESPONSE
SO MY GOAL AS A HEALTH PSYCHOLOGIST HAS CHANGED
IT ALSO HELPS YOUR BLOOD VESSELS STAY RELAXED DURING STRESS
I NO LONGER WANT TO GET RID OF YOUR STRESS
AND HERE THE SCIENCE SAYS YES
STOP STOP STOP
BEFORE THEY WENT THROUGH THE SOCIAL STRESS TEST THEY WERE TAUGHT TO RETHINK THEIR STRESS RESPONSE AS HELPFUL
WE'VE GOT TO GO OUT THERE AND CLEAN THIS THING UP
I'D GO TO THE SUPERMARKET AND ALL OF MY FOOD IS PACKAGED IN PLASTIC
IT HAS LOWER TAXES
WE WORRY MORE ABOUT HOW WE'RE JUDGED AND SEEN BY OTHERS WHETHER WE'RE REGARDED AS ATTRACTIVE
WE SPEND A GOOD BIT OF TIME
ONE OF THE COMPOUNDS THAT THESE MICROALGAE PRODUCE ARE ACTUALLY OMEGA 3S THE SAME OMEGA
THAT IS I THINK WHAT WE CAN DO BY THE MEANS OF BUSINESS AND PROFIT
THERE ARE SCENARIOS BY THE UNITED NATIONS' FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION THAT OUR FISHERIES MIGHT
THE MOST POWERFUL GAME CHANGER IS ACTUALLY USING THE SAME
THEN A SPECIAL INTERESTING KIND OF PLANTS THAT DOES THIS ARE THE MICROALGAE
THAT'S WHAT WE WANTED
WHILE MAKING THE BOOK WE TOOK GREAT CARE THAT NONE OF THE ILLUSTRATIONS WERE OBJECTIONABLE IN ANY WAY
BUT IN INDIA ONLY 12 PERCENT OF GIRLS AND WOMEN HAVE ACCESS TO HYGIENIC WAYS OF MANAGING
DURING MY YEARS OF WORK IN THIS FIELD I HAVE EVEN COME ACROSS STORIES WHERE GIRLS HAVE TO EAT AND WASH THEIR DISHES
WELL OF COURSE I WANTED TO SAY YES
A VERY MINUSCULE AMOUNT
WHY IS ALL THIS FOOD BEING WASTED
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CHILDREN AT SCHOOL WHO ARE TOO HUNGRY TO CONCENTRATE ELDERS WHO ARE STUCK AT HOME WITH
AND AT EVERY SINGLE ONE NEARLY EVERY MORSEL OF FOOD WAS TAKEN HOME AT THE END
I BELIEVE WHERE THERE IS A WILL THERE IS A WAY
SUGGESTED SELL BY DATE IS A SUGGESTION AND BEST BY DATE DOES NOT SAY BAD AFTER
YOU GREW IT
THERE IS ACTUALLY A HUGE NETWORK OF IT
SELL BY DATES SUGGESTED SELL BY DATES BEST BY DATES EXPIRATION DATES A LOT OF MYSTERY AROUND THEM
BUT TIME AFTER TIME PEOPLE WOULD COME UP TO ME AND ASK HEY CAN I EAT THIS FOOD
SO I DECIDED TO DO SOME RESEARCH
I WAS WORRIED
MY NEXT STOP WAS LANCASTER PENNSYLVANNIA AND I WASN'T SURE IF I WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO PULL IT OFF HERE IT'S KIND
SO AFTER A FEW INSTANCES OF THIS STEVE HAPPILY BECAME SEVE
THIS IS A SONG THAT I WROTE LAST YEAR
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THAT'S VERY UNUSUAL
I HAVEN'T SAID A THING TO YOU THAT MADE YOU THINK
WE BELIEVE THAT THE ONLY POSSIBLE CHOICE AFTER SCHOOL IS UNIVERSITY THE ONLY POSSIBLE
THE RAT GOES DOWN THE FOURTH TUNNEL THERE'S NO CHEESE IN THE FOURTH TUNNEL
EVENTUALLY THE RATS FIND THEIR WAY BUT THE HUMAN BEINGS WILL GO DOWN THE FOURTH TUNNEL
WE WANT TO FIGURE IT OUT
WE WANT TO SOLVE THIS PART BUT SCRAMBLE THE OTHER PART
I MEAN WE REPEAT THE SAME THINGS OVER AND OVER AGAIN
THE RAT COMES OUT
NOW HERE IS THE QUESTION
I WASN'T THINKING ABOUT HOW OTHERS WOULD REACT TO MY WORK
BUT I'LL TRY MY BEST
IT'S CALLED UNTITLED
BECAUSE IT DOES
AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TODAY
AND IN MY VIEW THE TELLING OF A STORY ISN'T REALLY WHAT MATTERS
WELL IT'S BEEN IMPORTANT IN MY LIFE
WHAT IS THE TIME AND THIS FEELING THIS SPINNING INTO THE INSIDE OF MY STOMACH
AN LED DRESS WITH 4400 LEDS THAT I CONTROL WITH MY GLOVE
NOW TODAY ACCORDING TO THE IUCN RED DATA LIST 91
AND AS I LOOK AROUND ME TODAY I SEE AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF WEALTH RIGHT HERE A WEALTH OF KNOWLEDGE
HOWEVER ON THE OTHER HAND MADAGASCAR IS A PLACE OF INCREDIBLE WEALTH A WEALTH OF
NOW SADLY BECAUSE OF THAT EXTREME POVERTY MANY OF THOSE LEMURS WERE HUNTED AND A LOT OF THE FOREST
AS THEY MUST BE AS EACH DAY IS A STRUGGLE FOR MERE SURVIVAL
ALONG MY JOURNEY I HAVE COME TO FIND THAT THE POOREST PEOPLE THE ONES WITH THE LEAST AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THEIR POCKETS HAVE BEEN THE
THE KIDS IN LAVAVOLO DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO BASIC EDUCATION
LEMUR HUNTING HAS DECREASED EDUCATION LEVELS ARE ON THE RISE AND LEMUR POPULATIONS ARE THRIVING IN
NOW WHEN I FIRST ARRIVED IN LAVAVOLO I THOUGHT FOR SURE THIS IS THE POOREST REGION OF THE
IS IT MONEY IN THE BANK
ANDREA LIVES ON THE ISLAND OF MADAGASCAR WHERE 95 PERCENT OF THE LOCAL PEOPLE ARE SUBSISTENCE
HOW DO WE DEFINE WEALTH
THE ISLAND INHABITS 23 MILLION PEOPLE WITH A THREE PERCENT GROWTH RATE
AND WHAT IS WORSE MANY DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ACTUALLY HAVE A BLANKET BAN ON
AT THE SAME TIME
TO SEND MONEY WITHIN AFRICA THE COST IS EVEN HIGHER OVER 20 PERCENT
FOR EXAMPLE SENDING MONEY FROM BENIN TO NIGERIA
IT ALL GOES IN SUITCASES
SO I WANTED TO FIND OUT WHAT IS IT THAT SETS THESE PEOPLE APART THE PEOPLE WHO DO THE PASSIONATE WORLD CHANGING WORK THAT WAKE UP INSPIRED
BUT ONCE WE HAVE THIS FRAMEWORK TOGETHER WE CAN START TO IDENTIFY THE THINGS THAT MAKE US COME ALIVE
YOU ARE THE AVERAGE OF THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU SPEND THE MOST TIME WITH
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SINK
I DON'T LIKE MY JOB
THEY JUST CAME BACK FROM A MONTH IN EUROPE ALL OF THEM TOGETHER
THE THINGS IS EVERYONE WAS IMPOSSIBLE UNTIL SOMEBODY DID IT
AND THOSE PEOPLE HAVE MADE UP THAT COMMUNITY OF PASSIONATE FOLKS WHO INSPIRED THAT POSSIBILITY THAT I
IT DIDN'T MATTER WHAT IT WAS
WE HAVE THIS LITTLE GROUP
I WANTED TO FIND THE WORK THAT I COULDN'T NOT DO WHAT THAT WAS FOR ME
EITHER WAY WE START TO BELIEVE IT
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT FOR SORTING OUT WHAT IT IS THAT YOU'RE NATURALLY GOOD AT
AND ONE OF MY FRIENDS NOW HE HAS A FAMILY OF EIGHT AND HE SUPPORTS HIS WHOLE FAMILY
IT'S ALL ABOUT JUST BUILDING YOUR RESUME
EITHER WE GIVE UP OR WE NEVER START IN THE FIRST PLACE
EVERY INVENTION EVERY NEW THING IN THE WORLD PEOPLE THOUGHT WERE CRAZY AT FIRST
IN 1898 NORMAN TRIPLETT DID THIS STUDY WITH A BUNCH OF CYCLISTS AND HE WOULD MEASURE THEIR TIMES AROUND THE
WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE
IF YOU DON'T THINK YOU CAN RUN A MILE YOU SHOW YOURSELF YOU CAN RUN A MILE OR TWO OR A MARATHON OR LOSE FIVE POUNDS OR
THE PEOPLE CHANGE EVERYTHING AND THIS IS WHY
AND HE DIVES IN SWIMS OFF
THIS BLEW MY MIND
THIS IS WHY YOU DON'T LET NINE YEAR OLDS SWIM FROM ALCATRAZ
YOU KNOW BEFORE THIS A PASSION COULD COME AND HIT YOU IN THE FACE OR MAYBE IN YOUR POSSIBLE LINE OF WORK YOU MIGHT THROW IT AWAY
BUT I WOULD HAVE TO WARN THEM BECAUSE AT THIS POINT MY QUIT RATE WAS ALSO 80 PERCENT
AND THAT LATER BECAME WHAT I NOW CALL LIVE YOUR LEGEND WHICH I'LL EXPLAIN IN A LITTLE BIT
THEY CHANGE EVERYTHING AND IT'S A PROVEN FACT
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED
AND THEN I'M OVER HERE IN SAN FRANCISCO AND EVERYONE AROUND ME WAS DOING IT
IT TURNS OUT THAT OVER 80 PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE AROUND DON'T ENJOY THEIR WORK
TO FIND SOMETHING THAT I COULD SCREW UP
THAT'S HOW TOUGH IT WAS
MOST THINGS ARE TOTALLY OUT OF OUR HANDS
I JUST HAD NO IDEA HE WAS GOING TO SWIM
HE'S LIKE BUT REALLY JUST HAVE FUN WITH THIS
ROGER BANNISTER AND THE FOUR MINUTE MILE IT WAS A PHYSICAL IMPOSSIBILITY TO BREAK THE FOUR MINUTE MILE IN A FOOT
SO I WANT EVERYONE TO PUT YOUR GLASSES DOWN WHATEVER YOU'RE HOLDING
YOU CAN DO THIS EVEN IN YOUR FANCY SHOES I'VE DONE IT
THAT'S WHERE THE REAL POWER LIES RIGHT
SO THE LAST THING I WANT TO COVER THIS EVENING GOES BACK TO HANDS ON THE RIBS
YOU CAN RELAX YOUR HANDS DOWN
RELAX THE SHOULDERS
AND SO I WANT YOU TO TAKE YOUR HANDS AND BRING THEM TO YOUR RIBS
AND THE BREATH IS ONE OF THE BEST TOOLS THAT I'VE FOUND TO BE ABLE TO BE IN OUR BODIES BE
SO STAY RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE MAYBE RELAX YOUR HANDS AGAIN
FEEL YOUR HANDS EXPAND
LET'S TAKE THREE MORE BIG BREATHS LIKE THAT
I'M HAPPY TO TEACH THESE TO YOU AT ANY TIME ANY DAY
ON YOUR INHALES LET WHATEVER IT IS THAT IS CONFUSING YOU OR THAT IS CLUTTERING YOUR BRAIN
WE ALL BREATHE
SO SOMETIMES WE WANT OUR BREATH TO FUEL OUR HEARTS SOMETIMES WE WANT IT TO FUEL PARTS OF OUR
SO LIFT AND SPREAD YOUR TOES
SO I WANT YOU TO STAND IN A WAY THAT GROUNDS YOU
ANOTHER BIG BREATH LIKE THAT
SO BEING IN YOUR BODY IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS IT IS TO BE IN YOUR BRAIN AS IT IS TO BE IN YOUR HEART
HOLD THE BREATH
YOU CAN GET YOUR FEET ON THE GROUND AND YOUR TOES LIFTED AND SPREAD YOU CAN GET AWARE OF THE HEART
RELAX YOUR SHOULDERS DOWN AND BACK
WE MIGHT AS WELL GET A LITTLE CORE STRENGTH WHILE WE ARE AT IT RIGHT
AND THEN WITH YOUR NEXT TWO BREATHS I'M GOING TO COUNT THEM OUT
FILL UP THE BACK OF THE HEART
CLOSE YOUR EYES
ALL GREAT IDEAS START WITH PASSION RIGHT
WHAT WE'RE DOING IS MOVING THE DIAPHRAGM WHICH ACTUALLY IS THE STRONGEST MUSCLE IN THE BODY WE'RE
PASSION IS CENTERED RIGHT HERE IN THE HEART
MY NAME IS RACHAEL AND I'M A FORREST YOGA TEACHER BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHAT KIND OF YOGA I TEACH
LET IT ALL OUT
I WANT TO WORK A LITTLE BIT ON GROUNDING
SO SAY YOU'RE AT YOUR DESK
I WANT YOU ALL TO FEEL EMPOWERED
EXHALING SLIGHTLY PULLING IN THAT LOW BELLY
HUGE BREATH INTO THE BACK OF THE HEART
CALL ME UP I'LL TALK YOU THROUGH IT
PICTURE THAT DIAPHRAGM MOVING
AND THEN ON YOUR EXHALES START TO CONSCIOUSLY LET THOSE THOUGHTS GO
THEY'RE IN THERE SOMEWHERE RIGHT
RIB CAGE IS PRETTY BIG
SO ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO FEEL YOUR RIBS
FILL YOUR CHEST
AND THAT OFTEN IS THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE SAYING WHAT IS IT THAT I'M ACTUALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT
LET THEM BE DOWN AND BACK
SO BRING YOUR HANDS BACK TO YOUR RIBS
EXHALE SLOWLY MORE SLOWLY
THIS IS MY VERY FAVORITE FORREST YOGA POSITION AND IT'S BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE SITTING AT YOUR
AND PLEASE BUY THEM
BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT BOYS PLAY WITH AND AS FEMALE SUPERHEROES JUST AS MY DAUGHTER
AND THAT IS NOT MIKE'S FAULT
AND DON'T JUST BUY THEM FOR YOUR DAUGHTERS BUY THEM FOR YOUR SONS
THAT IS OUR FAULT
PEOPLE WILL THINK IT'S CUTE
NOW THE SHOW IS MARKETED TO GIRLS AGES FIVE TO NINE BUT THERE ARE MILLIONS OF BOYS
EVERYBODY WANTED TO BE PART OF THIS
DISTURBANCES DIED DOWN IN THE GENERAL POPULATION
OUR STRATEGY IS NOT MASSIVE SYSTEM CHANGE
AND THEY'RE HERE FOR A REASON
NO ONE HAD EVER HEARD OF A CELL WITHOUT A TOILET
BUT THEN WE STARTED TO REALIZE THAT IF ANY INMATES NEEDED PROGRAMMING IT WAS THESE PARTICULAR INMATES
FROGS BUTTERFLIES ENDANGERED PRAIRIE PLANTS
THEY WERE MAKING A CONTRIBUTION A DIFFERENCE ONE THEY THOUGHT WAS MEANINGFUL AND IMPORTANT
OUT OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS GREW SOME NEW IDEAS AND WE STARTED SOME SMALL EXPERIMENTS
EVENTUALLY I DECIDED IF I WAS GOING TO END UP IN PRISON I'D BETTER END UP ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BARS SO I THOUGHT I'D CHECK IT OUT TAKE A TOUR OF
WE TRAINED THE INMATES ON THOSE SAME SKILLS
EVEN EIGHT MEN TO A CELL HAD A TOILET
I INTERACTED WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT LIKE ME PEOPLE WHO HAD DIFFERENT IDEAS AND CAME FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS
THEY WERE PATIENT WITH ME
I DON'T SEE MY JOB AS TO PUNISH THEM OR FORGIVE THEM BUT I DO THINK THEY CAN HAVE DECENT AND MEANINGFUL LIVES
SO THAT WAS THE QUESTION
SYSTEM CHANGE IS DIFFICULT AND SLOW AND OFTENTIMES IT DOESN'T TAKE YOU WHERE YOU WANT TO GO
BUT PRISONS CAN DO SOME THINGS WE NEVER THOUGHT THEY COULD DO
THEY WERE INSPIRED
I WAS EXCITED
STAFF WERE EXCITED
OFFICERS WERE EXCITED
NOW MANY THINGS WORK AGAINST SYSTEM CHANGE
HONESTLY IT FEELS COUNTER TO MOST OF THE INSTINCTS THAT YOU HAVE
SO I WANTED TO PUT FORWARD THREE SIMPLE THINGS THAT MIGHT HELP AS YOU TAKE YOUR OWN JOURNEY OUTSIDE OF YOUR
LITTLE GIRLS ARE AMAZING
AND WHAT IF
OR HOW DOES THE COMPUTER KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I PRESS PLAY' HOW DOES IT KNOW WHICH VIDEO TO
THEY HAVE CONFRONTED THE AUTHORITY
SO IN A WAY BY STUDYING A WOMAN YOU CAN READ THE STRUCTURE AND THE IDEOLOGY OF THE COUNTRY
I AM A NOMADIC ARTIST
I WORK IN MOROCCO IN TURKEY IN MEXICO
IN 2005 I GRADUATED FROM ST
WE ARE VERY VERY FORTUNATE HERE IN THE ROCHESTER AREA TO HAVE THREE OUTSTANDING BUSINESS
I ASKED MYSELF WHY
POWER WAS FOCUSED AT THE VERY TOP
AND IN THAT SITUATION SIFTING THROUGH THE WRECKAGE OF A SUICIDE DRONE ATTACK IT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT TO SAY WHO
WE HAVE LICENSE PLATES ON CARS TAIL NUMBERS ON AIRCRAFT
OR IS IT MERELY PRESUMPTUOUS
HE DID NOT RUN DOWN SHOUTING
I'M GOING TO FORCE MY WAY THROUGH THE AMAZON FOREST
IT' S A STORY ABOUT ALL OF US
BUT ALSO YOU HAVE TO TAKE A STEP
I'M GOING TO DO THIS
AND HOW MUCH I WANTED TO GO THERE SINCE I WAS SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD
AND AFTER READING THE THE ALCHEMIST I DECIDED TO BUY A PLANE TICKET TO ETHIOPIA
THIS MIGHT SOUND CRAZY IT SOUNDS CRAZY TO ME
AND I TURN TO CAROLINE AND SHE'S CRYING HER EYES OUT
NAIPAUL SAID TWO YEARS AGO I CAN READ TWO PARAGRAPHS AND KNOW IMMEDIATELY IF IT'S WRITTEN BY A WOMAN AND I JUST STOP
HE SAYS VERY SPECIFICALLY I WANTED THE WORLD TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE SHOULD LOVE AND
LET'S WRITE ABOUT IT
SO THE CHILDREN HAVE A PLOT
AND CAROLINE WHO HAD INVESTED SO MUCH IN E
LET'S MAKE A CHANGE TO ALL OUR INSTITUTIONS AND NOT JUST IN THE WEST
BUT ALL THESE YEARS LATER WE'VE MADE OUR MARK
LET'S FILM IT
AND IT GOES ON
WE HAVE TO BE PREPARED TO GO BACK THROUGH ALL OUR BOOKS AND OUR FILMS ALL OUR FAVORITE THINGS AND SAY ACTUALLY
SHE WAS A SECRETARY
THAT'S WHAT ART IS FOR
AND IT'S THAT CONVICTION THAT THAT WE ARE TAUGHT THAT I THINK COLORS SO MUCH OF WHETHER WE'RE
MY MOTHER LEFT SCHOOL WHEN SHE WAS 15
WHICH HE CONSIDERED DISGUSTING
WE WITH THE BROKEN BITS
WHAT IF YOU'RE THE PIONEER
BECAUSE WE ALL ARE HUMAN WE ALL STRUGGLE
AND I WAS FED UP OF ALWAYS BEING ON THE EDGE ALWAYS BEING THE ONE DOING THOSE WEIRD
OR PERHAPS IT'S ALCOHOLISM OR FAMILY DYSFUNCTION OR POVERTY OR HOMOPHOBIA IS SOMETHING
IF I HAD BEEN SPENDING MY ENERGY TRYING TO FIT IN I WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BE AN ADVOCATE FOR WOMEN
WHAT IF YOU'RE THE TRAILBLAZER
IT'S NOT A BADGE OF HONOR
WHAT WHAT WHAT
AND I FELT LIKE THE ONLY WAY TO ACHIEVE NORMALITY WAS TO NOT BE ILL ANY MORE TO NOT
ONE OF THEM ACTUALLY FITTINGLY ENOUGH FOUND ME WHEN I CHECKED INTO A DELI AT A
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
AND I THINK THAT'S GOING TO CREATE SOME INCREDIBLY INTRIGUING OPPORTUNITIES FOR TECHNOLOGISTS
NOW TO BE CLEAR I'M A JOURNALIST AND NOT A TECHNOLOGIST SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO BRIEFLY IS PAINT A PICTURE OF WHAT
NOW WE'RE ALREADY SEEING SOME SERVICES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO LET US DECIDE WHAT HAPPENS TO OUR ONLINE PROFILE
IT DEPENDS ONLY ON THE MASS OF THE OBJECT
AND IN FACT IT'S THE BEST EVIDENCE WE HAVE TO DATE FOR NOT ONLY EXISTENCE OF A SUPERMASSIVE BLACK HOLE AT THE CENTER OF OUR OWN GALAXY BUT
SO WHAT PEOPLE HAVE THOUGHT IS THAT PERHAPS THERE ARE SUPERMASSIVE BLACK HOLES WHICH
AND IN FACT TODAY THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THIS MYSTERY OF HOW DO YOU GET HOW DO YOU RESOLVE THIS CONTRADICTION
GRAVITY WINS OVER ALL OTHER KNOWN FORCES
BIGGER OBJECTS HAVE BIGGER SCHWARZSCHILD RADII
BECAUSE I WANT TO SHOW THERE IS A MASS INSIDE AS SMALL A REGION AS POSSIBLE
AND IF I KNOW THE SCALE OF THE ORBIT I KNOW THE RADIUS
SO IF I KNOW HOW FAST IT GOES AROUND I KNOW THE MASS
SO YOU SHOULDN'T SEE YOUNG STARS
SO WHAT I WANT TO TELL YOU VERY BRIEFLY IS A FEW EXAMPLES OF THE EXCITEMENT OF WHAT WE CAN DO TODAY AT THE
IT'S THE GRAVITATIONAL PULL THAT MAKES THESE THINGS ORBIT
AND THAT BUYS US ABOUT A FACTOR OF 20
AND THEN IT'S A BLACK HOLE
AND I'M GOING TO ONLY TALK ABOUT THE MASS
SO IN THAT SENSE IT'S A VERY SIMPLE OBJECT
AT THAT POINT GRAVITY WINS
LANGUAGE IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT TOOLS CREATED BY HUMAN BEINGS
PUTIN HAS GONE ON TO VOW THAT HE WILL PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF RUSSIAN SPEAKERS AROUND THE
SO WHY IS THAT A PROBLEM
I THINK GENDER IS MULTIDIMENSIONAL AND COMPLEX
FOR OTHERS IT MEANS
THINK OF THE BOX YOU CHECK OFF ON A FORM THAT'S IDENTITY
ON A QUIET GENTLE BOY
GUESS WHAT DAY
IF YOU'RE A LESBIAN OR A HETEROSEXUAL MAN YOU MIGHT SAY I'M ATTRACTED ONLY TO WOMEN
WHAT MATTERS TO ME IS THAT THEY ARE BRIGHT AND KIND AND FEMINIST AND LAUGH AT MY JOKES
WHAT IF YOU'VE HAD THESE FEELINGS AND EXPERIENCES WITH MORE THAN ONE GENDER
I FINALLY GOT THESE CARDS
FOR SOME PEOPLE BISEXUALITY MEANS
WELL THEY COULD GO FURTHER
IT'S NOT ENOUGH THAT MANY PEOPLE I KNOW AND MANY OF US IN THIS ROOM PROBABLY HAD THIS OPPORTUNITY
WELL THEY WERE RIGHT
TAKE FOR EXAMPLE STEVE JOBS
LOOKING BACK NOW I SEE THERE'S A CLEAR MESSAGE TO THIS SONG
THIS IS A MATTER OF ECONOMIC BENEFIT THIS CAN REALLY CHANGE THE WAY WE WORK LIVE AND PLAY WHY WOULD WE NOT DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT
I BELIEVE THAT TRAUMA IS THE NUMBER ONE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS IN OUR COUNTRY
HOW CAN WE MAKE IT SO THAT THEY'RE HAPPY
AND IT TURNS OUT KIDS LOVE IT
ANYWAY YEAH SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON
SO I ENCOURAGE YOU TO GET YOUR KIDS INTO THESE COMPETITIONS THEY'RE WONDERFUL COMPETITIONS THEY CAN STRETCH THEIR MINDS
THEY NEED TO DO THAT
THERE'S ALSO SOLAR CAR RACES
IT MAKES YOU THINK OF AUTUMN
AND WHAT IF YOU GET INTO A CAREER THAT'S IN TECHNOLOGY
SO THOSE ARE VERY IMPORTANT THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT THE KIDS SHOULD BE REALLY PUTTING
AND PERHAPS MORE SO THAN ANY OTHER PROJECT OF OURS WHERE THIS HAS A SPECIAL MEANING IS OUR RECONSTRUCTION
AND NOBODY REALLY NOTICED IT BECAUSE MOST EVERYONE THINKS OF IT AS IT IS FLAT
BUT WE WANTED TO REFLECT THAT LIGHT INTO THE GROUND
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS INTERESTING IS THAT HUMAN BEINGS ACTUALLY RESPOND IN A VERY POSITIVE
WHEREAS IF YOU ASK SOMEONE FROM NEBRASKA THEY THINK IT'S THE MOST AMAZING THING ON EARTH
THEY'RE BEING LAID NOW AND IN A BEAUTIFUL WAY
WHICH IS ALSO IMPORTANT
THEY'RE WORKING THROUGH THE WINTER THROUGH THE COLD WEATHER TO MAKE SURE THAT IT HAPPENS QUICKLY
AND WE MOVE IN MANY WAYS LIKE LIVESTOCK
AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF IT'S GREAT IN THIS MOMENT WHEN I RECOGNIZE THAT HE PUT VALUE IN
WE CREATE LIVES FOR OURSELVES THAT ARE DOMESTIC
SO I FOUND A LITTLE FRUIT STAND ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD
SO OVERVIEW OF THE SPACES ALONG BROADWAY HERE WITH 7TH AVENUE STILL HAVING TRAFFIC
AND THAT'S WHERE THE RAIN WATER PUDDLES ACTUALLY APPEAR
THESE ARE SOLID GRANITE CURBS THAT WILL GO IN ON THE CORNERS OF THE STREETS
WE'RE ACTUALLY INCREASING THE SPEED OF TRAFFIC BECAUSE WE'RE REMOVING TRAFFIC LIGHTS FROM TIME SQUARE
WE THEN THOUGHT TO OURSELVES HOW ARE WE GOING TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM
I THOUGHT IT WAS KIND OF FUN
OF COURSE WE'RE SEEING ALL KINDS OF ODD THINGS
BECAUSE EVERYONE'S IN THE SAME BOAT
IT'S A GREAT TEAM WORKING OUT THERE
AND WE THOUGHT TO DO THAT AT TIME SQUARE
WE TRIED TO UNDERSTAND THAT BETTER
WHICH IS A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE TO HAVE
ONCE WE WENT OUT TO TIME SQUARE AND WE STOOD AT ONE END AND WE LOOKED ACROSS TIME SQUARE FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER
I THOUGHT TO MYSELF IF YOU REPLACED THE WORD COW WITH THE WORD HUMAN IT STILL MAKES PERFECT SENSE
WE HATE TO ADMIT IT BECAUSE WE THINK WE'RE ABOVE ALL THAT
THE SPACE BETWEEN THINGS
A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO I WAS IN CHINA
WE'RE MICRO GRADING AREAS TO REMOVE THE DRAINAGE PROBLEM
THERE'S A WONDERFUL THESE ARE DAYLIGHT SUNLIGHT STUDIES WE MADE OF TIME SQUARE
AND THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO ALLOW THEM TO FEEL SAFE OR COMFORTABLE
SO WHY IS IT THAT THOSE TWO PLACES ARE SO DIFFERENT
I ALWAYS LAUGHED WHENEVER I READ A TEMPLE GRANDIN BOOK
SO WHILE IT'S REASONABLE TO ASK THE QUESTION IT'S NOT REASONABLE TO SAY THAT REFUGEE IS ANOTHER WORD FOR TERRORIST
THE MOST VULNERABLE REFUGEES NEED TO BE GIVEN A NEW START AND A NEW LIFE IN A NEW COUNTRY
IT'S A HOME TO 90000 PEOPLE
GET NO EDUCATION AT ALL AND THREE QUARTERS OF SECONDARY SCHOOL AGE GET NO EDUCATION AT ALL
WHAT HAPPENS IS THEY TAKE RISKY JOURNEYS
REFUGEES SEEKING SANCTUARY HAVE SEEN THE WEST AS A SOURCE OF HOPE AND A PLACE OF
IT'S ALSO REVEALING ABOUT WHETHER WE KNOW OUR OWN HISTORY
AND SO MY ANSWER WOULD BE THE LEADERSHIP HAS GOT TO COME FROM BELOW NOT FROM ABOVE
IN ONE YEAR 500000 REFUGEES WENT ACROSS THE ISLAND
THEY DO COME FROM FARAWAY PARTS OF THE WORLD
NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO BE BANNING REFUGEES AS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES
SHE WAS BORN TO REFUGEE PARENTS AND NOW SHE'S A REFUGEE HERSELF IN LEBANON
THAT'S WHAT LONG TERM DISPLACEMENT MEANS
THEY WERE SUPPORTED INTO WORK
AND THAT COULD HELP SLOW DOWN GLOBAL WARMING
FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE SEE DRAMA WE ROOT FOR THE PERSON THAT REALLY FIGHTS ALL THESE
THIS IS WHAT DRAMA IS ALL ABOUT
AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO QUALIFY THE PURPOSE
WHY AREN'T WE TALKING ABOUT THIS
THERE'S A RISK THAT COMES WITH ANY KIND OF SUPPORT FOR THE LGBT MOVEMENT
DOES THIS WORK FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE HAVING SEX WHO ARE THE SAME BODY TYPE
AS CITIZENS WE CAN TALK TO OUR SENATORS
THESE ARE THE KINDS OF RISKS THAT COME WITH ANY KIND OF ALLYSHIP
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT ALLIES PUSH BACK THESE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THEM AND CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE LGBT
BRING UP THE CONVERSATION TALK ABOUT IT
WHEN WE ARE NOT TEACHING OUR STUDENTS ABOUT SAME SEX RELATIONSHIPS WE WERE FAILING TO MAKE SCHOOL A MORE
SO HOW IS THIS AFFECTING THEM
NOT ONLY ARE WE FAILING TO EDUCATE QUEER TEENAGERS WE ARE PUTTING THEM IN DANGER BY SENDING THEM INTO A WORLD WITHOUT PROPER TOOLS
WE BEGAN TO DEAL WITH OUR YOUTH AND WITH THOSE WHO WE CONSIDER ARE ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE FENCE
THEY CAME AND SAID STOP THAT
AND STOP THAT
IT WAS THOSE GUARDIANS IT WAS THAT VILLAGE MENTALITY
AND DO THIS
BUT I SAY THIS
I LOVE BEING A POLICE OFFICER BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A CALLING FOR ME AND NEVER A JOB
I WAS JUST SO TIRED
WE SAID THIS IS YOUR COMMUNITY TABLE
I'M JUST GOING TO SHOW YOU SOME FOOTAGE AND TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK
NOW RON HOWARD RAN INTO BUZZ ALDRIN WHO WAS NOT ON THE MOVIE SO HE HAD NO IDEA THAT WE WERE FAKING ANY
YOU WOULD NEVER EVER DESIGN A ROCKET LIKE THAT
AND THEN I DID KIND OF GET THE REACTION I WAS HOPING FOR
SO HE BASICALLY SET UP OR BASICALLY SHATTERED THE SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF BECAUSE WHAT HE PHOTOGRAPHED WAS THE REAL THING
JIM CAMERON ACTUALLY PHOTOGRAPHED THE REAL TITANIC
IT'S LIKE YEAH I DON'T KNOW IF YOU NOTICED BUT I'M THE GUY OUT IN THE PARKING LOT RECREATING ONE OF AMERICA'S FINEST MOMENTS WITH FIRE EXTINGUISHERS
SHOTS WERE COMBINED AND I WAS JUST REALLY CURIOUS I MEAN WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU LOOKING AT JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO AND HOW
AND I GUESS SOMEBODY THOUGHT THEY NEEDED TO DO THAT
YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE A ROCKET GO UP WHILE THE GANTRY ARMS ARE GOING OUT
THROUGHOUT THIS I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH UNSUNG HEROES AND INVISIBLE ANGELS TO BRING INNOVATIVE E
JC YES THERE ARE STILL TRAGEDIES THAT HAPPEN ON THE BUMPY ROAD TO EQUALITY
THAT IS UNTIL I SHOWED HER THE PHOTOS OF THE SUPERGAYS THAT WE INTERVIEWED IN INDIA
BUT THERE ARE ALSO STORIES OF HOPE AND COURAGE IN EVERY CORNER OF THE WORLD
BUT THEY WERE FIGHTING IT OUT
THEY WOULD BE THE KIND OF PERSON THAT I ASPIRE TO BE
THE WEST HAD CORRUPTED ME WITH DIVERGENT IDEAS AND IF ONLY MY PARENTS HAD NEVER LEFT TAIWAN
NOW THIS WAS A DREADED QUESTION THAT I GOT ASKED A LOT BY LOCALS WHILE TRAVELING
WELL ONE STUDY TESTED THIS BY EXAMINING PEOPLE'S PERSONALITIES
HERE'S ONE OF HIS BESTSELLING BOOKS
ANYBODY DO ANY WRITING TODAY
WELL WHAT EXPLAINS ALL THESE STUDIES
WE'RE THINKING ABOUT GOING ON OUR WAY
ONE OF THESE REVIEWS IS FAKE
THE GOVERNMENT HIRES THESE PEOPLE COMPANIES HIRE THEM ALL OVER THE PLACE
THE OTHER REVIEW IS REAL
ONE OF THE REASONS IS PRETTY SIMPLE
I'VE THOUGHT THAT MANY TIMES
THEY ARE CLUSTERING PRETTY CLOSE TO THE TRUTH
WE EMAIL WE TEXT WE SKYPE WE FACEBOOK
IT COULD BE REVIEWS
YOU REMEMBER THOSE ASTROTURFING REVIEWS THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT BEFORE
THE SOCK PUPPET ISN'T ABOUT AMBIGUITY PER SE
IT COULD BE PROPAGANDA
THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT IT
WHAT'S THE NEXT BIG IDEA FROM THAT
WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR US IN OUR LIVES
THEY SAID HOW BIG THE BATHROOM WAS OR THEY SAID
THE PERSON STAYED THERE
IT'S BEEN REVIEWED MANY TIMES
THE PERSON NEVER WAS AT THE JAMES HOTEL
THE EYES DO NOT TELL US WHETHER SOMEBODY'S LYING OR NOT
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE DIFFERENT PATTERNS OF LANGUAGE
HERE'S THE LAST ONE YOU'RE TALKING TO SOMEBODY AND YOU SAY SORRY GOT WORK GOTTA GO
THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE SAYING LOOK I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU NOW OR I DIDN'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU THEN BUT I STILL CARE ABOUT YOU
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
I CAN ASSURE YOU THERE'S DECEPTION THERE
THEY WERE CONSTRAINED
BUT I WANT EVERYBODY TO RAISE THEIR HAND AT SOME POINT
MY FRIENDS NO WAY THEY CAN BE THAT COOL AND HAVE GOOD OF A LIFE
HOW MANY OF YOU IN THE LAST 24 HOURS THINK BACK HAVE TOLD A LITTLE FIB OR A BIG ONE
HOW ABOUT FACEBOOK ITSELF
REMEMBER I STUDY DECEPTION
THAT'S A LONG TIME AGO
YOU KNOW WE ALWAYS THINK THAT HEY THERE ARE THESE IDEALIZED VERSIONS PEOPLE ARE JUST SHOWING THE BEST THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN THEIR LIVES
THAT REALLY IS STRANGE
THIS ISN'T A DECEPTION DETECTION MACHINE TO TELL IF YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S LYING TO YOU ON TEXT MESSAGING
NOW LET'S PUT ASIDE THE ONLINE ANONYMOUS SEX CHATROOMS WHICH I'M SURE NONE OF YOU HAVE BEEN IN
THANK YOU ALL
I REMEMBER IT BEING KIND OF SCARY WHEN I FIRST CAME TO PRISON
SHE RECEIVED DEATH THREATS ON HER CELL PHONE AFTER SCHOOL
WHEN SHE WAS GOING TO BE HOMESCHOOLED SHE WENT TO THE MENTOR PRINCIPAL AND SHE ASKED IF I'M BEING HOMESCHOOL CAN I STILL
IDEALLY I DIDN'T WANT TO DEMONIZE THEM
AND HER PARENTS WERE GETTING DESPERATE AND THEY WERE NOT GETTING HELP FROM THE SCHOOL
NONE OF THEM WANTED TO TALK TO ME
I REMEMBER VERY WELL WHEN COLUMBINE HAPPENED
I FELT VERY UPSET
IN FACT I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S WHAT HAPPENS ANYWHERE
TEENAGERS JUST DON'T TELL THEIR PARENTS EVERYTHING
THERE WAS ALSO A VERY COMPLEX STORY THAT POSITED THAT I WAS A PEDOPHILE AND I WAS RUNNING FROM STATE TO
I DID TRY AND TALK TO ANY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MENTOR SCHOOL DISTRICT
I WANTED TO HEAR WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY ABOUT THE BULLYING PROBLEM IN THEIR SCHOOL
DID YOU EVER STOP TO THINK ABOUT HOW THOSE ITEMS OF INVENTORY ACTUALLY FOUND THEIR WAY INSIDE THAT BOX IN THE
AND I STARTED THINKING ABOUT IT AGAIN
IF THE WORKER IN STATION THREE DECIDES TO LEAVE AND GO TO THE BATHROOM IT HAS NO IMPACT ON THE PRODUCTIVITY OF
BUT THAT WOULD ACTUALLY GET YOU ORIENTED PRETTY FAST RIGHT
SO WHAT I'M DOING RIGHT NOW IS I'M MAKING SOUNDS WITH MY MOUTH AS I'M EXHALING
THERE ARE HUMANS AROUND THE WORLD WHO STAY ORIENTED REALLY WELL
AND SHE DID
SHE RAN AND MANAGED TO ESCAPE
AND AS I LOOK OUT TO THE AUDIENCE AND I'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT WITH MANY OF YOU TODAY THERE ARE SO MANY RACES
YOUR FAMILY HAS STORIES
YOU COME FROM A TRIBE SOMEWHERE YOU COME FROM A PEOPLE SOMEWHERE
SO WHY DO WE DO THIS PROJECT
I DIDN'T ASK HIM IF HE GOT SEASICK HIS DAUGHTER GETS SEASICK AND I JUST WONDERED IF HE DID
WE TAKE A MORE HOLISTIC APPROACH TO LIFE AND EVERYTHING THAT WE DO
WELL THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE ANYMORE
SO I STAYED LIKE THAT FOR A WHILE
THESE ARE THE FACTORS WHICH CREATE THAT BUBBLE WHICH SURROUNDS US THAT IS OUR PERCEPTUAL FIELD OUR
WHEN OUR FIRST NATIONS INUIT AND MANTIS COMMUNITIES ARE BEING RAVAGED BY A SUICIDE RATE 5 6
AND THAT'S BECAUSE SUICIDE IS A PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN NOT A CRIMINAL ONE
I HEARD THE GUIDANCE COUNSELOR ASK FROM ACROSS THE ROOM MILES AWAY IT SEEMED LIKE HE SAID MARK
I JUST TOOK A DEEP BREATH
AND THIS IS HOW I DO IT
HE'S ONLY EVER BEEN MARRIED TWICE
AND IT WAS A DREAM
SUDDENLY WHAT WE'RE FINDING WITH THESE CONCERTS AWAY FROM THE STAGE AWAY FROM THE FOOTLIGHTS OUT
I WANTED TO BECOME THAT KIND OF RED CROSS DOCTOR THAT DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS
AND INSPIRED BY WHAT I LEARNED FROM NATHANIEL I STARTED AN ORGANIZATION ON SKID ROW OF MUSICIANS CALLED STREET SYMPHONY
THERE'S A BEAUTIFUL QUOTE BY THE ROMANTIC GERMAN COMPOSER ROBERT SCHUMANN WHO SAID TO SEND
AND THAT AFTERNOON I HAD TO ASK HIM HOW WAS IT FOR YOU MAKING THAT DECISION
BUT I HAD AN ULTERIOR MOTIVE OF VISITING GOTTFRIED SCHLAUG AND IT WAS THIS THAT I WAS AT A CROSSROADS IN MY LIFE
I HAD JUST COMPLETED MY UNDERGRADUATE AND I WAS WORKING AS A RESEARCH ASSISTANT AT THE LAB OF DENNIS SELKOE
I WANTED TO BECOME A SURGEON
AND YES WHILE USING THE THREE PATHS LET'S NOT FORGET LET'S ALWAYS KEEP IN MIND THE BASIC PRINCIPLE THAT LIES AT THEIR
THESE GUYS ARE SOFT AND CHUBBY
WE'RE UP AGAINST A PARADOX AGAIN
THE BRAIN DOESN'T HEAR SOUND OR SEE LIGHT
NOTHING AT ALL
HOW DOES THE BRAIN GENERATE THE EXPERIENCE OF BEING A BODY AND OF HAVING A BODY
YOU'RE LOCKED INSIDE A BONY SKULL TRYING TO FIGURE WHAT'S OUT THERE IN THE WORLD
SO OUR MOST BASIC EXPERIENCES OF BEING A SELF OF BEING AN EMBODIED ORGANISM ARE DEEPLY GROUNDED
BUT MY EXPERIENCES OF THE BODY FROM WITHIN THEY'RE NOT LIKE THAT AT ALL
WELL JUST THE SAME PRINCIPLES APPLY
NOW FOR MOST PEOPLE AFTER A WHILE THIS LEADS TO THE VERY UNCANNY SENSATION THAT THE FAKE HAND IS IN FACT
THERE'S NO LIGHTS INSIDE THE SKULL
AND IN THIS PROCESS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST REMAINING MYSTERIES IN SCIENCE AND PHILOSOPHY
SOMEHOW WITHIN EACH OF OUR BRAINS THE COMBINED ACTIVITY OF MANY BILLIONS OF NEURONS EACH ONE
I'D LIKE YOU TO THINK ABOUT CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE WAY THAT WE'VE COME TO THINK ABOUT LIFE
AND THEN THE FOOD IS EITHER HAMBURGER OR HOTDOG
WE DIDN'T HAVE A STRONG GOVERNMENT
UNCLE BUYS A CONDOM
I SAID DON'T WORRY
SO WE HAVE NOW FOUND THE WEAPON OF MASS PROTECTION
AND THEY'D ENJOY IT IMMENSELY I SEE THEM STANDING AROUND RIGHT NOW EVERYWHERE
WE DIDN'T HAVE LOTS OF DOCTORS
BUT IT'S EVERYBODY'S JOB WHO CAN CHANGE ATTITUDE AND BEHAVIOR
VERY GOOD UNCLE
EVERY MINISTRY EVEN JUDGES HAD TO BE INVOLVED IN AIDS EDUCATION EVERYONE AND WE SAID THE PUBLIC
THE WOMEN SAID WE AGREE
AND THIS PICTURE WAS SENT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY
IT ENDS WHERE IT BEGINS FROM TO COMPLETE ITSELF
SO I STARTED TO WONDER
SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
SO THAT WAS REALLY SOMETHING EXCITING
HE WAS IN A MOVIE CALLED TORCH SONG TRILOGY
I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SO CONFUSED I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SO UPSET
AND THEN HE REACHES INTO HIS POCKET AND HE BRINGS THIS OUT TO ME
AND I SAID TO MYSELF LZ FOR SO LONG YOU HAVE BEEN DENIED THIS
IT'S VERY VERY FRUSTRATING AND I WAS FEELING LEFT OUT LIKE I WASN'T QUITE GAY ENOUGH
IT'S A WONDERFUL DAY IN OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY IT'S A WONDERFUL DAY IN THE GLOBE'S HISTORY TO BE ABLE TO HAVE AN ACTUAL SITTING
LOVE AND RESPECT THAT'S WHAT THE WHOLE FILM WAS ABOUT
I REALIZED THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WEREN'T AS GAY AS I WAS GAY BEING HAPPY NOT GAY BEING ATTRACTED TO THE SAME SEX
I'LL WATCH THIS
NOW THOSE PROGRAMS CAN MAKE SENSE IF THEY IN FACT INDUCE NEW LOCATION DECISIONS AND THE WAY THEY CAN
ANOTHER OBJECTION USED SOMETIMES HERE TO INVEST IN EARLY CHILDHOOD PROGRAMS IS CONCERN
SPECIFICALLY THE INTERDEPENDENCY HERE IS IS THAT THERE ARE HUGE
AT LEAST I HOPE NOT
WHEN LEGISLATORS AND OTHERS THINK ABOUT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WHAT THEY FIRST OF ALL THINK ABOUT ARE BUSINESS TAX
IT'S A SOMEWHAT MORE INDIRECT WAY
OR AT LEAST ENOUGH OF THEM WILL STAY THAT IT WILL PAY OFF FOR YOUR STATE ECONOMY
SO CLEARLY THE PRODUCTIVITY OF FIRMS IN SILICON VALLEY HAS A LOT TO DO WITH THE SKILLS NOT ONLY OF THE WORKERS AT
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS A LOT ON ITS PLATE AND STATE GOVERNMENTS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO STEP UP
WELL ONE OBVIOUS BARRIER IS COST
YOU SACRIFICE NOW FOR A RETURN LATER
AND SO THEY'LL BOTH UNDERINVEST BECAUSE EVERYONE'S GOING TO MOVE OUT
SO WHEN YOU LOOK FOR EXAMPLE AT METROPOLITAN AREAS SUCH AS THE BOSTON AREA MINNEAPOLIS ST
IT'S NOT EXACTLY A LOW COST PROPOSITION
THAT IS THE NOTION OF INVESTMENT
THEY HAND OUT ALL KINDS OF BUSINESS TAX BREAKS
I'VE SPENT MOST OF MY CAREER RESEARCHING THESE PROGRAMS
I'VE TALKED TO A LOT OF DIRECTORS OF STATE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES ABOUT THESE ISSUES A LOT OF LEGISLATORS ABOUT THESE ISSUES
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU ARE STILL INVESTED IN THAT YOU STILL BELIEVE IN THE NOTION OF INVESTMENT
THE FIRST IS YOU HAVE TO FALL IN LOVE
AND IT'S REALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE WE ONLY EVER REFERENCE THAT IN A VERY BASIC WAY
FIRST YOU HAVE THE FOLLICULAR PHASE FASCINATING PHASE
IN FACT YOU WERE RIGHT
AND BEING A NOW WHAT SOLUTION KIND OF GIRL I SAID SO NOW WHAT
IT'S TIME TO STOP THIS EXPERIMENT
AND FOR SOME REASON HE WAS LIKE SURE WHY NOT
AND VISUAL SPATIAL PEOPLE ARE REALLY GREAT AT SEEING THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THINGS AND THE WHOLE
ALREADY YOU CAN START TO SEE PATTERNS
THEY LET ME SYNTHESIZE AND VISUALIZE MY LEARNING
THAT'S THE PRINCIPLE SO THERE ARE MANY DETAILS
WE HAVE A FEW WEEKS TIME TO DISCUSS LATER
BUT IT'S A MORE EQUAL FLOOR
NO IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE
IT'S NOT NEW BUT IT IS A STEP IN HISTORY AND IT'S AS DIFFICULT AS IT WAS TO
WE HAVE TO RENEW IT
HOW MANY PEOPLE WANT IT
AND ASK YOURSELF
AN UNCONDITIONAL BASIC INCOME CREATES A HUGE INCENTIVE TO CREATE BETTER WORK
I MEAN YOU'VE CHANGED THE FUTURE
YOU'RE A VISIONARY RIGHT
I MADE IT PUBLICLY AVAILABLE AND IT WASN'T EVEN OPEN SOURCE AT THAT POINT
THIS COULD ACTUALLY IMPROVE THIS
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO MAKE SMALL SMALL CHANGES
YOU HAVE PEOPLE RANDOMIZED TO EITHER RECEIVING THE TREATMENT WHICH IS THE WORKING
SO THE MAGIC NUMBER SEVEN ISN'T SO MAGIC AFTER ALL
IF I WERE TO TEST YOU YOU WOULD REMEMBER ROUGHLY SEVEN ITEMS HERE
WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE TEST RESULTS WE COULD SEE THAT CHILDREN DOING THE TRAINING THEY HAVE
AND NOW WE HAVE MORE THAN 50 THOUSAND CHILDREN THAT HAVE
SO ONE WAY TO PUT THAT IS YOU NEED TO REMEMBER WHAT TO FOCUS ON
THIS IS NICE
DOES IT MATTER
THIS HAS BEEN TERMED THE MAGIC NUMBER SEVEN
SO THE SAME TASK
THAT'S A BIT HARDER
CAPACITY TO STORE INFORMATION IS LIMITED
IN MANY OPPRESSIVE STATES THE MEDIA IS JUST A TOOL FOR GOVERNMENT PROPAGANDA
I HEARD THE COMEDIAN WANDA SYKES IN THE PERFECT STATEMENT
BUT WHEN WE'RE TALKING I ALWAYS HAVE TO REMIND THEM THAT I'M OVER HERE WITH COUSINS THAT WRITE
AND THEY HAVE GREAT KIDS AND THEY'VE GOT A GREAT LIFE
AND WE DO IT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN
AND I SAID WHAT WOULD YOU SAY
SHE SHOULD JUST START TALKING
WE ARE WORKING TO CHANGE THE LAWS TO REFLECT THAT
AND SHE SAID YOU ARE NOT
I SAID WHAT DO YOU MEAN
EVERYBODY KNOWS IT
ONLY THE WEALTH OF OUR MINDS IS NOT THE VERY FACT THAT WE HAVE A SELF THAT WE CAN
THE AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL SELF IS BUILT ON THE BASIS OF PAST MEMORIES AND MEMORIES OF THE
WE OWN OUR MINDS
SO FROM THE RETINA YOU GO ONTO VISUAL CORTEX
THAT'S WHERE THE DIFFERENCE IS
DON'T FORGET THAT AMERICA'S RISE WAS BASED IN SIGNIFICANT PART ON THE
HOWEVER GIVEN THE FACT THAT AMERICA IS A DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM PUBLIC OPINIONS DO MATTER
THEY ALL AGREED TO ONE FACT THAT IS BY 2025 CHINA IS NOT GOING TO BE A
BUT AFTER 2010 THE YEAR WHEN WE ALL THINK CHINA BEGAN TO MAKE SOME
I HAVEN'T TALKED MUCH ABOUT THE US
BUT I THINK IN ORDER TO TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE OF CHINA WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE US
GLOBALLY THE US WILL STILL BE THE HEGEMON
I HOPE I CAN GIVE YOU ANSWERS BY THE END OF THIS 15 MINUTE PRESENTATION BUT
SO I DON'T THINK THIS WILL BE THE FUTURE FOR CHINA
HAROLD BROWN THE FORMER SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I DID
WE OWE IT TO CHILDREN TO CREATE A WORLD THAT IS MORE ENGAGING
STRANGE AND WONDERFUL THINGS BEGAN TO HAPPEN AT OUR SCHOOL
WE KNOW THAT THE SCHOOL THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE MAKING IN MADRID IS GOING TO BE NOTHING LIKE THE SCHOOL THAT WE HAVE
THANK YOU SO MUCH
AND AS WE WATCHED WHAT WE WERE DOING AND LOOKED AT THE KINDS OF ENGAGEMENT WE WERE GETTING FROM THE CHILDREN WE REALIZED WE
EDUCATION SHOULD BE THE FIRST THING
LIFT AIR SPEED DRAG CENTER OF GRAVITY
I NEEDED TO MAKE IT
EVERYTHING EVERYTHING IS INTERESTING
ACTUALLY IT'S ABOUT ONE WORD IN THE TITLE
WHEN I WAS A LOT YOUNGER THERE WAS A RIDDLE THAT WAS POSED TO US
OR A BLACK WOMAN GOT A JOB
IT TURNS OUT ACCORDING TO MOST STUDIES THAT THOSE COUNTRIES THAT ARE THE MOST
GENDER EQUALITY IS ABOUT WOMEN RIGHT
I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE WORD MY
JUST LIKE THAT
IT IS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE
THEY HAVE HIGHER RATES OF RETENTION HIGHER JOB SATISFACTION HIGHER RATES OF PRODUCTIVITY
IF YOU LISTEN TO WHAT MEN SAY ABOUT WHAT THEY WANT IN THEIR LIVES GENDER
THEY SMOKE LESS DRINK LESS TAKE RECREATIONAL DRUGS LESS OFTEN
IT IS A WIN WIN FOR EVERYONE
SOME OF YOU MAY WINCE TO REMEMBER THIS RIDDLE
RESEARCH BY CATALYST AND OTHERS HAS SHOWN CONCLUSIVELY THAT THE MORE GENDER EQUAL
THEY HAVE LOWER JOB TURNOVER
IT'S NOT A WIN LOSE
IT WAS A QUOTE FROM ONE OF THE MEN AND THE QUOTE WAS A BLACK WOMAN STOLE MY JOB
I HAD TO START THINKING ABOUT THEM AND IT HAD BEEN PRIVILEGE THAT HAD KEPT IT INVISIBLE TO ME FOR SO LONG
WHAT DO MEN HAVE TO DO WITH GENDER EQUALITY
WHEN I SAY IT THEY GO WOW IS THAT INTERESTING
AND WHO WOULDN'T WANT THAT
CAN'T MAKE IT
BUT SOMETIMES IT JUST SAT THERE
RATHER THAN MINDING THE STORE
THE OTHER DAY I WAS IN KERALA MY HOME STATE AT THE COUNTRY FARM OF A FRIEND ABOUT 20 KILOMETERS AWAY FROM
IT WAS ESSENTIALLY INDIA BEING ITSELF
AND THAT MAKES US LARGER THAN THE U
BUT HE'S CARRYING A 21ST CENTURY INSTRUMENT
IN FACT LEGEND HAS IS THAT WHEN DOUBTING THOMAS THE APOSTLE SAINT THOMAS LANDED ON THE SHORES OF
I HAVE READ A REUTERS DISPATCH SO THIS IS NOT INDIAN PROPAGANDA A BRITISH NEWS AGENCY ABOUT HOW ROBBERS IN THE
AFGHANISTAN WE KNOW WHAT A SERIOUS SECURITY PROBLEM AFGHANISTAN IS FOR SO MANY OF US IN THE WORLD
BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THAT ELECTORAL OUTCOME HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD
GOVERNMENTS AREN'T VERY GOOD AT TELLING STORIES
I MEAN THE PROLIFERATION OF INDIAN RESTAURANTS SINCE I FIRST WENT ABROAD AS A STUDENT IN THE MID 70S AND WHAT
AND IT WAS A HOT DAY AND HE SAID HEY WOULD YOU LIKE SOME FRESH COCONUT WATER
AND HE WHIPPED OUT HIS CELLPHONE DIALED THE NUMBER AND A VOICE SAID I'M UP HERE
WE CAN'T REALLY BE BOTH OF THOSE
AS A TELEPHONE MARKET
WE KNOW WE HAVE THAT
THE AMERICANS HAVE EVEN RECOGNIZED IT IN AN AGREEMENT
AND WE CONTINUE TO GROW
THAT IS A 21ST CENTURY STORY AS WELL AS AN ANCIENT ONE
NOW THIS IS A TACTIC THAT PATENT TROLLS ARE SUPPOSED TO USE ON PEOPLE TO GET THEIR WAY
THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY WOULD LIKE STRONGER PROTECTIONS FOR INVENTORS
WELL DURING THE SETTLEMENT PROCESS WHEN WE RECEIVED OUR COPY I STRUCK IT
DON'T FORGET THAT
THE HI TECH INDUSTRY WOULD LIKE STRONGER PROTECTIONS FOR PRODUCERS
AND AS A RESULT THE PATENT TROLL CAN CLAIM THAT THEY WON THE CASE
NOW THE REASON THIS WORKS IS BECAUSE PATENT TROLLS ARE PAID A PERCENTAGE OF WHAT THEY'RE ABLE TO RECOVER IN SETTLEMENTS
IN THE CASE OF GOOSEBERRY NATURAL RESOURCES THIS PATENT ON EMAILING NEWS RELEASES HAD SORT OF A FATAL FLAW
NEVER MIND THE FACT THAT THE ADDRESS LED TO A STRIP MALL SOMEWHERE IN NORTHERN L
WITH NO EMPLOYEES
THIS RECORD THAT I WROTE STARTED IN A MOTEL ROOM IN SPEARFISH SOUTH DAKOTA
AND SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINES WE STOPPED BEING YOUR CHILDREN AND YOUR GRANDCHILDREN AND INSTEAD
ALL OF US HERE ARE SO FOCUSED ON FINDING SOMEBODY ELSE TO BLAME FOR OUR OWN ACTIONS THAT WE HAVE FAILED TO
BUT GENERATION Y HAS BEEN CATAPULTED INTO A WORLD WHERE REALITY HAS BEEN PUT IN FAVOR OF OUR DREAMS
AND SO EACH DREAM IS ONLY ONE CHAPTER AND CARRIES THE STORY FORWARD A LITTLE BIT
IT WAS WONDERFUL FOR ME
YOU ALWAYS SEE THE BUDDHA SITTING ON A LOTUS FLOWER
I DIDN'T NOTICE THAT THE SAME DREAM KEPT COMING BACK
AND THEN IT WENT IN A DIRECTION THAT I DIDN T LIKE
MAYBE THE WHOLE CAMPUS
I LL WORK WITH MY DREAMS
IT S NOT JUST THE WHOLE STAGE
THIS WILL WORK FOR ME
IT WENT IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION
I WENT TO MY FATHER S PLACE
WITHIN A WEEK I WAS ON AN AIRPLANE DOWN TO MIAMI
WE D WORK WITH DREAMS
I SAID NO WAY
NOW THE STANDARD IDEA OF DREAMS IS THAT WE HAVE THIS
AND ACTUALLY THEY COULD MAKE PEOPLE MOVE THEIR ARM AGAIN
THE PROBLEMS IRON OUT
TWO WEEKS LATER I GOT A PHONE CALL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT MY FATHER HAD A HEART ATTACK
WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS LANGUAGE
ANYONE CAN DO THIS
MONTAGUE ULLMAN WENT FURTHER THAN THAT
I D NEVER HEARD ABOUT THAT
AND IT OCCURRED TO ME I MIGHT WRITE A NOVEL
SOME OF THEM WERE BOOKS ABOUT DREAMS
AND IT CAME OUT OF ME
YOU DON T HAVE TO BE AN EXPERT TO DO THIS
AND I D LOVE TO SHOW YOU THREE EXAMPLES OF HOW I ACTUALLY TRY TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN IN
I TOLD YOU I WAS WEIRD
WHICH FELT EXTRAORDINARILY CORRECT
SO HOW ABOUT OTHER THINGS
BECAUSE OF HIS RESEARCH I TRAVELED THE WORLD A LOT AND I KEPT MOVING SCHOOL AND COUNTRY
AND I CHOSE THE SCIENCES
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SCALES AND CHORDS AND INTERVALS AND THE CYCLE OF FIFTHS WHAT WE WERE DOING IS MAKING GEOMETRIC SHAPES
ONLY 4 DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE MUSLIM POPULATION HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED IN THE LAST DECADE FROM HALF A
A TIME WHEN MANY HOPED THAT FREEDOM WOULD COME AS SPRING WOULD COME
TO MY SURPRISE AND THE SURPRISE OF ALMOST EVERYONE RELIGION NOT ONLY
AND IF THEY DO SOCIAL VIOLENCE ALSO OFTEN RESULTS
SO AGAIN THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA STAND OUT ON THIS MEASURE AS HAVING 4 TIMES THE LEVEL
I'VE PULLED THEM OUT OF THE CHART AND I'LL BLOW THEM UP TO REPRESENT THEIR POPULATION SIZE
HE SAID THE WALL IT'S FALLING RIGHT NOW
WE HOPPED IN HIS CAR WE DROVE AS FAST AS WE COULD TO THE WALL AND WE WERE PART OF THE
THAT'S A GOVERNMENT RESTRICTION
WE LIKE IT A LOT BECAUSE IT'S AN OBJECTIVE MEASURE YOU CAN COUNT THE NUMBER OF PINS BETWEEN 0 AND
THE STUDY WAS ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF GLUCOSE ON AGGRESSION
NOW THE NOISE IS A COMBINATION OF NOISES THAT MANY PEOPLE REALLY HATE LIKE FINGERNAILS
AND WE EXPLAINED THIS TO PARTICIPANTS AFTER THE STUDY WAS OVER
THEY HAD HIGHER STANDARDIZED TEST SCORES THEY WERE MORE LIKELY TO GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE THEY HAD HAPPIER MARRIAGES
SO I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU ABOUT OUR EXPERIMENTAL STUDY ON HANGRY
AND THEY DO THIS TASK 25 TIMES SO WE CAN GET A MORE RELIABLE MEASURE OF AGGRESSION
YOU'RE GOING TO DESICCATE OUT THERE
I LOVE TO STUDY THESE ANIMALS THAT BREAK THE RULES BECAUSE EVERY TIME THEY BREAK A RULE THEY INVENT SOMETHING NEW
THEY BREAK THE RULES
WHY IS THAT
REMEMBER AS THE SPEED GETS UP THE THRUST GOES DOWN
THERE'S BEEN A LOT IN THE PRESS THESE DAYS ABOUT SPACE TRAVEL
REMEMBER THAT SPECIFIC IMPULSE PLOT
SO WHILE I'M WHACKING ON ONE MOLE NEW MOLES POP UP
SO WE PUT IN A VEHICLE DESIGN AND OUT POPS ITS PERFORMANCE
HIGH FIVES IN THE ROOM
FOR HIGH SPEED FLIGHT THE BENEFIT OF A SCRAMJET OVER A ROCKET IS A ROCKET HAS TO CARRY ITS OWN OXYGEN
AFTER ALMOST A HALF A CENTURY THE THEORY OF SCRAMJETS WAS FINALLY PROVEN
YOU'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE THREE TIMES
ALL IN THIS AMAZING LITTLE PILLS
AND HERE S WHAT HAPPENED
IT S ONLY WHEN YOU CHANGE FOR THE LONG TERM YOU CHANGE THE WAY YOUR THOUGHT PROCESSES WORK THAT S
UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS FULL OF REFINED STARCH LOTS OF ADDED SUGARS ADDITIVES AND PRESERVATIVES AND WHATEVER ELSE
SO LET S TAKE BUTTER AS AN EXAMPLE
YOU RE LUCKY IF YOU GRAB A SANDWICH ON THE WAY
REALLY SOLID EVIDENCE BEHIND THAT KIND OF A DIET
I'M NOT HERE TO TALK ABOUT BODY IMAGE THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER TALK
BASICALLY RICE BUTTER AND SUGAR
BUT DIET REALLY JUST MEANS THE WAY THAT WE EAT AND WHAT WE ARE EATING
WE WERE BOTH ILL BY ABOUT DAY 3 IN BED SO WE DECIDED
SO HERE S WHAT I VE SEEN HAPPEN
NO IT DIDN T SAY THAT BUT THAT S THE MEDIA REPORTING
THEN WE TRIED SOMETHING ELSE CALLED THE SCARSDALE DIET THAT INVOLVED EATING A DRY PIECE OF WHOLEMEAL TOAST IN THE MORNING WITH
EVERYTHING IS GRABBING ON THE RUN
GO BACK TO EATING LOTS OF FAT
MORE THAN A DECADE AGO NOW ACTUALLY I THINK
THAT STUDY SHOWED THAT THE AMERICANS WERE MUCH MORE CONCERNED AND WORRIED ABOUT THE FOODS THAT THEY BUY THEY WERE MUCH MORE
MOM AND I EMBARKED ON A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIETS
THAT S ACTUALLY WHAT THE RESEARCH SHOWED
AND I HOPE YOU LL AGREE WITH ME THAT THAT IS AN IDEA WORTH SPREADING
RUSH RUSH RUSH
THE JAPANESE DIET
WE KNOW THAT DIABETES IS ON THE RISE
THEY CERTAINLY ARE IN MINE
I REMEMBER BEING A TEENAGER DOING EXCHANGES WITH A STUDENT IN FRANCE AND WE HAD BOWLS OF HOT CHOCOLATE WITH
BUT AT SCHOOL WE HAD TO SAY GRACE BEFORE WE ATE OUR LUNCH
NOW THAT'S NOT AN AESTHETIC PROBLEM
WE ABSOLUTELY MUST EAT MORE PLANT FOOD
EVERYTHING IS ON THE RUN
SO THEY BROUGHT ANOTHER ONE
THE IPHONE THE IBOOK THE IPAD
WHAT DID THIS MEAN
THOUGHTS ARE LIKE THAT
I HAVE A STORY
IT'S AT YOUTUBE
WHEN THEY GATHERED SOME HUNDRED CHILDREN INTO THIS SMALL LIBRARY THE LIBRARIAN INTRODUCED ME AS
WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING
BECAUSE THIS IS THE WAY THEY TRAFFIC IN STORY
YOU MAY BE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED
ARMED WITH A FIRMER UNDERSTANDING OF THE AIR POLLUTION PROBLEM AND HAVING MANAGED TO SOURCE OVER A
WHY NOT JUST GO AHEAD AND TACKLE THE PROBLEM AS BEST AS YOU CAN IN YOUR OWN WAY
SO I DECIDED I'D BETTER GET TO KNOW SOME PEOPLE WORKING WITHIN THE FIELD
I WANTED TO CREATE AN ONLINE AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT PLATFORM THAT WOULD UNCOVER TRENDS IN POLLUTION
OUR WILLPOWER AND IMAGINATION ARE A GUIDING LIGHT ENABLING US TO CHART NEW PATHS AND
THEY GIVE US GREAT WEALTH BUT WE CAN NOW HAVE ALL OF THAT BUT WITHOUT THE DOWNSIDE
WE CAN NOW GET SOLAR ENERGY FROM GERMANY AND HYDRO ENERGY FROM NORWAY
WHY SHOULD YOU CARE ABOUT INDUSTRIAL ROBOTS
FOR THE LONGEST TIME WE HAD TO RELY ON THESE FACULTIES BECAUSE WE DID NOT HAVE ANY ALTERNATIVES
BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT NOW SAL SEES ME AS A SOURCE OF SUPPORT AND
THIS WASN'T WORKING
AND SHE WAS AFRAID
SHE WAS NOT BEING STUBBORN WHEN SHE REARED SHE WAS FEARING FOR HER LIFE
WE TESTED A LOT OF SPECIMENS THERE AND THEN THE GOVERNMENT THEY ACTUALLY SAW OUR RESULTS
WE HAVE TO TRY THAT
AND THAT'S TRUE
AND THIS IS NOT AS FAR FETCHED AS IT SEEMS
WE ALL NOW THAT ENTERING THE JOB MARKET IS CHALLENGING
THAT'S SOME POWERFUL FOOD FOR THOUGHT
I WAS DETERMINED TO WIN THE SECOND
ACCORDING TO THE PEW CENTER ON THE STATES 2011 REPORT NEARLY 45 OF PEOPLE
THE PDC EFFECT HAD WON THAT FIRST ROUND
5 MILLION PEOPLE WERE RELEASED FROM PRISON IN THE UNITED STATES
ONE THAT HAS AN ACADEMIC PATHWAY THAT OFFERS DEGREES
AND THEY ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES
A FOUR YEAR COLLEGE DEGREE FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON COSTS ALMOST THE SAME AS 1 YEAR OF
THE VAST MAJORITY OF US PRISONERS WILL BE RELEASED AT SOME POINT
I WILL NEVER FORGET IT
UNIVERSITY BEYOND BARS HAS MADE A GREAT START WITH AN INCREDIBLE IDEA
OF COURSE WE CAN ONLY GAIN THESE THINGS TROUGH INDIVIDUAL HARD WORK
BUT THE BIGGEST THING THAT WE NEED IS YOUR SUPPORT
I WAS OUT WALKING THE TRACK THE OTHER DAY AND I OVERHEARD A FELLOW PRISONER TELLING HIS FRIEND HOW THIS IS HIS SIXTH TIME IN
NOR IS IT SO DIFFERENT FROM THE SITUATION THAT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF OTHERS FIND THEMSELVES IN
EMPIRES ROSE AND FELL
SOME DID BETTER THAN OTHERS
HOW SMART DO YOU WANT TO BE
NOW OUR DISCOVERY POINTS US TOWARDS BETTER WAYS TO SUSTAINABLY MANAGE CORAL REEFS BUT IT ALSO SHOWS
BUT COPYING BEHAVIOR IS ALSO COMMON IN WILD ANIMALS
MOST OF THESE INTERVENTIONS THOUGH TARGET LATE ADOLESCENTS OR ADULTHOOD WHEN
WE TEACH SWIMMING AND SOCCER
THE QUESTION FOR US THIS AFTERNOON IS REALLY
WE ARE BEGINNING TO LOOK AT ALTERNATIVES TO INCARCERATION FOR NON VIOLENT CRIME
WE CAN NO LONGER PRETEND THAT THE JOBS OF THE PAST ARE GOING TO COME BACK OR THAT EMPLOYMENT WILL BE ENOUGH
AND THE STORY OF THE LAST THREE DECADES HAS BEEN THE SLOW DISAPPEARANCE OF THOSE JOBS
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS USES SOFTWARE TO WRITE 3000 FINANCIAL REPORTS EVERY
POOR CHOICES DON'T LEAD TO POVERTY
AND IT'S NOT JUST MY OWN FAMILY
IN FACT IT ENCOURAGES ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND ALLOWS PEOPLE TO CONTINUE THEIR SCHOOLING
I MEAN THAT'S SO COOL
AND HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHAT WORKS IF WE CAN'T TRUST RESEARCH
THE NIGHT SHE DIED MY MOM WAS REACHING UP TOWARDS SOMETHING I COULDN'T SEE AND I DIDN'T KNOW THEN THAT THAT WAS PART OF DEATHBED
SHE SAID I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO
NOW HIS FAMILY HAD ALSO COME
SO ONE AFTERNOON I FORGOT TO SAY
THERE WERE FLOWERS
FOR THAT MOM AND FOR OTHER FOLKS IN MY RESEARCH THESE VISIONS THESE DEATHBED PHENOMENA
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE THEM
I HAD HAD A DREAM THAT HE WAS SITTING IN A CHAIR HIS LEGS CROSSED READING A BOOK
THEY LEFT SHORTER LADDERS
PEOPLE SEE LANDSCAPES
WITNESSES TALKED ABOUT HOW THEY RECOGNIZE THAT THE PHENOMENA THAT WERE HAPPENING WERE SIGNS THAT DEATH
ONE WIFE SAID TO ME SHE WAS TALKING TO HER HUSBAND ONE AFTERNOON AND SAID DO YOU EVER SEE ANYBODY OR
CAME DOWN STAYED WITH HIM AND THEY HAD A REALLY BIG PARTY
THERE WERE PEOPLE TALKING
THEY'VE GOT TO GET SOMEWHERE
HE WAS READY
BUT THERE WAS THE RUGBY TEAM
AND HE WAS OFTEN IN THE OTHER ROOM
I'M GOING TO GO GET A DRINK
I WANT TO HEAR YOUR STORY
MR HARRISON THE LAST TWO WEEKS OF HIS LIFE AND KEPT HIM COMPANY AND HELPED HIS TRANSITION BEING AN EASIER
AND THE STORY WENT THAT THERE WAS A BOY THERE THAT WAS DYING
SHE SAID WHO'S THERE
HIS PARENTS HAD COME HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS
HIS DAUGHTER TALKED ABOUT HOW BUTCH WAS OFTEN IN THE OTHER ROOM
THIS IS A VERY COMMON METAPHOR FOR THE DYING
I'M TAKING A LITTLE BREAK TO THE RIGHT AND THERE WAS A ROOM THERE
AND WHEN WE GET SCARED OF SOMETHING VERY OFTEN WE STOP TALKING ABOUT IT
WE DON'T TALK ABOUT DEATH AND DYING VERY OFTEN
PLEASE TELL ME YOUR STORY
I'M A DEATH EDUCATOR AND A DEATH RESEARCHER AND THAT MAKES ME A LITTLE CRAZY
BUTCH WAS A PRETTY FAMOUS RUGBY PLAYER IN SOUTH AFRICA IN HIS DAY
I GOT A TEXT ONE AFTERNOON FROM HIS DAUGHTER THAT THE VISIONS HAD STARTED AND EVERYTHING WAS OKAY
ONE OF THE TRICKS OUR INSTRUCTORS TAUGHT US WAS YOU KNOW WE HAD TO THROUGH THESE LABS WHERE WE HAD TO NAME WHAT
NOW THAT'S NOT A DIFFICULT TEST
THE THIRD REASON WE SAW WAS AN INCREASE IN TECHNOLOGY
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE OTHER 99
I'M THINKING OF MAKING IT A CAREER
NOW I'M A BIG FAN OF TECHNOLOGY BUT THE RESEARCHERS HAD TOLD ME THAT WE NOW WATCH AS A NATION ABOUT
AND THAT WAS HAVING A DELETERIOUS EFFECT
BE FEARLESS IN TERMS OF WRITING YOUR SCHOOLS
SO MY CONCERN IS
SO I NAMED MINE CHARLIE
WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR WE SAW SOME UNBELIEVABLY STRONG STATISTICS THAT SHOWS THIS WAS WORKING
IF YOU PULL ON A VEIN IT'S LIKE A GUITAR STRING AND IT'LL TWANG
WELL WE'RE GETTING THE PRODUCT OF THAT BUT IN ADDITION TO SECOND AND THIRD ORDER EFFECTS WERE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT WERE JOINING
ONE MINUTE OF PUSH UPS ONE MINUTE OF SIT UPS AND A ONE MILE RUN
AND THE COUNTER OBESITY MEASURES
AND THAT WAS
YOU COULDN'T JUST GET A 16 OZ DRINK YOU COULD GET A 24 42 64 OZ SODA
BUT THE COMBINATION OF A LACK OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND AN INCREASE OF POOR
YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF MAYOR BLOOMBERG IN NEW YORK WHO HAS BANNED ALL
THIS IS WHAT NFL MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL THEY KNOW THEY'VE GOT TO EAT RIGHT IN ORDER TO PERFORM AT THEIR MAXIMUM
BE FEARLESS IN TRYING TO GET NUTRITION BACK IN RESTAURANTS
WE ESTIMATE THAT WE WILL HAVE A 40 CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE RATE BY THE YEAR 2030
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN PUT A YELLOW RIBBON ON AND SAY LET SOMEBODY ELSE TAKE CARE OF IT
BUT WE WERE FINDING THAT A GREAT MAJORITY OF OUR NEW SOLDIERS COMING OFF THE CIVILIAN ENVIRONMENT COULD NOT
WHEN I PULLED ON CHARLIE'S ARTERIES AND VEINS THEY BROKE OFF INTO MY HAND
THEY THEN SENT ME TO BE THE COMMANDER OF INITIAL MILITARY TRAINING
THERE ARE SEVERAL ORGANIZATIONS WHO ARE ATTEMPTING TO APPROACH THIS
AND WE CHANGED SEVERAL THINGS
FOR ME THIS WAS AN ECONOMIC ISSUE
BE FEARLESS IN BALANCING YOUR LIVES AND GETTING OUT TO EXERCISE
THE HEART WAS SURROUNDED BY FAT SEVERAL INCHES
I WALKED INTO THE CLASSROOM AND THEY ISSUED ME A CADAVER
AS THEY DID EVERYONE ELSE IN THE CLASS
THAT'S FIVE HOURS A DAY
AN ECONOMIC ISSUE
AND THE CADAVER I HAD CAME WITH A MEDICAL HISTORY THE PROFESSOR TOLD US IN ORDER TO
WE'RE SEEING AN INCREASE IN DIABETES
SO IN TYPICAL ARMY FASHION I SAID WE'VE GOT TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES WITH OUR NEW RECRUITS
I WANT TO SEE A FUTURE WHERE WE CAN DO INFORMATION TRACKING AND MANAGE THE FLOW OF DISEASES
EVERY TIME THAT OUR BODY BREAKS WE PATCH IT UP BY DRUGS OR WE PATCH IT UP BY AS
AND THAT'S EXTREMELY EXTREMELY SCARY THAT WE'RE LETTING DOCTORS MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON PATTERN
TAKE THAT IN FOR ONE MINUTE
FIND YOUR OWN CONCRETE WAYS TO CARRY ACROSS OUR MANY CULTURES
WE DON'T FLY OR SWIM BETTER
IT'S A COMMON GROUND UPON WHICH WE CAN PLANT COMPLEX YET BALANCED CONVERSATIONS
WE DON'T CLIMB HIGHER
WE ARE ABLE TO DO THIS NO MATTER WHAT OUR CULTURAL BACKGROUND IS
SPOKEN LANGUAGES THOUGH CAN CREATE BARRIERS BETWEEN CULTURES
THEY OFTEN PREVENT YOU FROM LEARNING ABOUT AND RELATING TO ALL THE FASCINATING THINGS
BUT THE ONE POINT THAT STAYED WITH ME FROM THAT CONVERSATION WAS MADE BY A JESUIT PRIEST PADRE
OR HOW WE THINK INTERNATIONALLY FOR THE WIDER WORLD
BUT WE ALSO NEED TO CHANGE HOW WE THINK ABOUT VULNERABILITY
YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO IMAGINE IT
WE'RE TOLD THERE AREN'T ANY OTHER OPTIONS
CANADA FOR EXAMPLE HAS AT TIMES PUT HUMAN SECURITY AT THE HEART OF ITS FOREIGN POLICY
WHO'S THAT PERSON
THESE VIDEOS DON'T TELL SOMEONE'S WHOLE STORY
CRUCIALLY THEY'VE GOT LOADS OF FRIENDS
YOU'VE GOT WORK YOU LOVE
NONE OF THEM EVER OVERDOSE
IT'LL BE 15 YEARS THIS YEAR SINCE THAT EXPERIMENT BEGAN AND THE RESULTS ARE IN
WE GIVE THEM CRIMINAL RECORDS
THAT'S HOW WE THINK IT WORKS
EVERYONE HAS A BIT OF THEM THAT LOOKS AT AN ADDICT AND THINKS I WISH SOMEONE WOULD JUST STOP YOU
THEY CAN HAVE LOADS OF SEX
BUT THE BIGGEST THING THEY DID WAS THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE OF WHAT WE DO A MASSIVE PROGRAM OF JOB CREATION FOR ADDICTS
IT'S BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT BONDS AND CONNECTIONS THAT YOU WANT TO BE PRESENT FOR
FORGET THE DRUG WAR
SO SAY YOU USED TO BE A MECHANIC
WE PUNISH THEM
I WANTED TO KNOW HOW TO HELP THE PEOPLE I LOVE
LOOKING AT THIS THERE WAS ANOTHER PROFESSOR CALLED PETER COHEN IN THE NETHERLANDS WHO SAID MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T EVEN CALL IT ADDICTION
THAT'S WHAT WE WANT AS HUMAN BEINGS
WE SHAME THEM
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT
THERE ARE LOADS OF PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM YOU MAY NOT REALIZE IT YOU'VE TAKEN QUITE A LOT OF HEROIN
THEY'RE REALLY SIMPLE
IT WON'T BE YOUR TWITTER FOLLOWERS WHO COME TO SIT WITH YOU
IT SAYS THAT IT'S ESTIMATED THAT OF YOUR WORKING AGE POPULATION OF PEOPLE WITH A DISABILITY THAT ARE
SO I'LL ASK THE QUESTION
DO YOU KNOW WHY
YOU CAN'T SAY
WELL LISTEN HERE IS THE PROBLEM
IT'S TO TRAIN AND DEVELOP
AND THEN MOVE ON TO THE NEXT STEP
SHE WAS DRAGGED OFF THAT BUS SHE WAS SHOUTING THE WHOLE TIME
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
I WANT TO TELL ONE MORE STORY ABOUT WOODY GUTHRIE
THE LAW SAID THAT A WHITE PERSON COULDN'T EVEN SIT ACROSS THE AISLE FROM A BLACK PERSON BECAUSE OF THE
THAT'S THE PART THE KIDS DON'T SING
THE CAPTAIN SAYS OH I CAN'T DO THAT
I HEAR VOICES WHO ARE THOSE PEOPLE
SO HE OPENED THE DOOR AND LET THE BLACK SOLDIERS COME IN AND SING WITH THE WHITE SOLDIERS
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
AND WOODY'S UP ON DECK AND AT LEAST IF THEY ARE HIT HE PROBABLY HAS A CHANCE
WHY AREN'T THOSE MEN IN WITH THE OTHER MEN
HARRIETT WOULD NOT MOVE
SO IN ORDER TO PAINT THE PORTRAITS I HAD TO SPEND MORE TIME THAN PAINTING RESEARCHING READING
I'M GOING TO TAKE CARE OF MYSELF I WASN'T THINKING I'D BE LAUNCHING A PROJECT THAT WOULD TAKE AS OF NOW
WHAT'S HE TALKING ABOUT
LET'S GO AND HAVE A DEMONSTRATION ON SATURDAY
THEY SOMETIMES EVEN DO EXPERIMENTS AND LECTURES IN COFFEE HOUSES
THE SAME IS POSSIBLE IN SOCIAL MEDIA TODAY
HE PRINTS A THOUSAND COPIES
IT MIGHT TAKE YOU THREE YEARS 10 YEARS OR 20 YEARS UNTIL YOU ARE ABLE TO SPEAK ABOUT
I'M SO HAPPY THAT I'M COMING TO THE MEETING TOMORROW
BUT HOW WOULD I KNOW IF SHE WAS FEELING WELL OR WAS IT JUST ANOTHER BIPOLAR
I WAS VERY SURPRISED TO SEE THAT SO MANY PEOPLE SHARED MY EXPERIENCE AND FOR THE FIRST TIME
SOME PEOPLE ARE MORE INTELLIGENT
HERE IS THE SECOND ONE
SO AS WE WRESTLE WITH THIS QUESTION THE LACK OF A COMFORTABLE ANSWER'S PROPELLING THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANIMAL RIGHTS LAW
DARWIN EXPLAINED THAT YOU ARE ALL A BUNCH OF ANIMALS RIGHT
SO I THOUGHT WHAT I WOULD TALK ABOUT IS WHY THAT'S THE CASE AND WHY IT'S TIME TO RE EVALUATE OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER ANIMALS
SO HERE'S THE FIRST ONE
THAT'S WHY ANOTHER PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THE LAWS FOCUSED ON CRUELTY TO ANIMALS
AND IT'S GREAT
THAT'S ALL IT IS
THAT'S WHAT I AM
I IMAGINE MOST OF THE PEOPLE SITTING IN THIS ROOM SPENT MOST OF THEIR TIME WHEN THEY WERE IN MIDDLE SCHOOL
WHY ARE WE SURPRISED WHEN SO MANY STUDENTS DROP OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL
HE WAS JUST BEING WHAT I WAS
I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT A PROGRAM I STARTED THERE WHICH FROM MY POINT OF VIEW IS THE PROUDEST THING I DID
AND SHE SAID DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS
SO HOW DO WE DO THAT
AN AMAZING WOMAN
THIS WAS NOT A DEVASTATING STROKE BUT IT DID AFFECT HIS SPEAKING AND SO FORTH
IT WAS ABOUT THEIR ENERGY
THEY HAVE THEIR PLACE
AND I WAS DYING
THEY HAVE TO THINK THAT THEY DID SOMETHING AND THAT THEY WANT TO SHARE IT WITH YOU
I SAID DID JEFFERSON EVER DISAPPOINT YOU
FIRST OF ALL WAS THAT DANCE EVEN THOUGH IT HADN'T BEEN OFFERED TO HER WAS HER LIFE
THE USUAL SORT OF THING
THE WORST INTERVIEW I EVER DID WILLIAM L
AND SO I CAME UP WITH THE IDEA OF THE LIVING SELF PORTRAIT SERIES
I NEVER CLAIMED THAT
AND THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT
ALL OF THOSE ACCIDENTS THAT WOUND UP CREATING THE LIFE NARRATIVE THAT WE INHERITED
BY THE WAY THIS WAS ALWAYS DONE IN PUBLIC
GOODNESS I MEAN I'M ASTONISHED RIGHT NOW
BELIEVE ME IT WILL
I MEAN WHEN I WAS A CHILD IF SOMEBODY SAID SOMEBODY IS LIKE THIS I WOULD HAVE SAID IMPOSSIBLE
AND YOUR IMPOSSIBLE WILL BECOME POSSIBLE
BUT TODAY WE ALL HAVE MOBILE PHONES
SO I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU A QUESTION
MY FAVORITE PASS TIME IS SLEEPING AND DREAMING
LIKE WHO HAD EVER THOUGHT THAT WE WOULD HAVE ONE DAY SOMETHING LIKE A MOBILE PHONE
AND THE IDEA THAT WE CAN ALL BE RESURRECTED TO LIVE AGAIN IS ORTHODOX BELIEVE NOT JUST FOR CHRISTIANS BUT ALSO
AND SO IT SHOULD BE WITH US
IT'S JUST THIS
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE A GREAT WARRIOR LIKE ACHILLES OR A GREAT KING OR HERO
SO 100 YEARS AGO HORMONES HAD JUST BEEN DISCOVERED AND PEOPLE HOPED THAT HORMONE TREATMENTS WERE GOING TO
IT CAN HAPPEN IN DIFFERENT WAYS OF COURSE AND USUALLY COMES IN STAGES
AND IF YOU REACH BACK INTO THE DARK CORNERS OF YOUR MEMORY YOU MIGHT REMEMBER SOMETHING LIKE
THEY WERE THEN ASKED AGAIN ABOUT THEIR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS
IN FACT SHE HAD A HUGE IMPACT ON MY CAREER
AND WHEN I SPOKE TO BENAZIR BEFORE SHE WENT BACK SHE TOLD ME ABOUT ALL THE ASSASSINATION THREATS
BUT WITHIN A MINUTE THERE WAS A MUCH BIGGER BLAST AND THEN THERE WAS ORANGE FLAME EVERYWHERE AND THEN
HE WOULD NOT ONLY KNOW WHAT TIME IT WAS HE WOULD ALSO KNOW WHERE THE SUN WOULD RISE AND HOW IT
AND ASTROLABES RETURN US TO THIS SUBTLE SENSE OF HOW THINGS ALL FIT TOGETHER AND ALSO HOW
IT'S JUST AN INCREDIBLE DEVICE
THEY ARE JUST INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE
HOW WOULD YOU TELL THE TIME SAY 600 YEARS AGO
BUT WHAT WE LOSE I THINK IS AN ACCURATE A FELT SENSE OF THE SKY A SENSE OF
AND WHAT WE GAIN WITH A NEW TECHNOLOGY OF COURSE IS PRECISION AND ACCURACY
EVERY TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES
EVERY TECHNOLOGY IS TRANSFORMED AND MOVED BY OTHERS
BUT I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU HOW WOULD YOU TELL THE TIME IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE AN IPHONE
HOW WOULD YOU DO IT
ASTROLABES HAVE AN INCREDIBLE HISTORY
BUT A REAL ONE WOULD COST ABOUT AS MUCH AS MY HOUSE AND THE HOUSE NEXT TO IT AND ACTUALLY EVERY HOUSE ON THE BLOCK
THIS PARADOXICAL EFFECT CALLED THE LANDAU DAMPING IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT IN PLASMA PHYSICS
ALL MY THOUGHTS RAISED TO MY MIND FROM KEYBORD TO PAGE
AND WHAT BETTER WAY THAN WRITING A BOOK
IF YOU'VE EVER READ A CHICK FLICK BOOK BEFORE SET IN A HIGH SCHOOL SETTING CHANCES ARE THE AUTHOR HAS ALREADY PASSED THAT
CESAR AND I TRIED TO WRITE A PIECE FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE EXPLAINING HOW THIS WORKS
AND IF YOU CAN'T FIND THE ANSWERS YOU MUST BE LAZY OR STUPID
NEVERTHELESS ARCHIE MANAGED TO GET PERMISSION TO DO THIS
MARMITE IS A BREAKFAST SPREAD BELOVED OF THE BRITISH
AND PEOPLE DO TERRIBLE THINGS IN WARS
WE'RE GOING TO TEST THEM OUT
WE NEVER DO
I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO DO IT
YOU PUT IT IN CARDBOARD BOXES
I SEE IT IN OUR BUSINESS LEADERS
THE GERMAN CAMP GUARDS THEY'VE GOT BORED
HE SAID HE HEARD SUSPICIOUS LAUGHTER
SO THE SITUATION SEEMED PRETTY DESPERATE
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE NOTICED SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THIS MECHANISM OF INJURY IS ALTHOUGH THERE'S A RAPID
AND SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS FOR SOME OF YOU OF MORE IMMEDIATE NATURE I'VE GOT A COUPLE YEARS
AND SO THAT DID SOMETHING FIRST THAT WAS A LITTLE COUNTERINTUITIVE
AND THIS MIGHT BE JUST A RESULT OF MY OWN TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE
THERE IS HOPE
SO WHAT MIGHT BE HAPPENING THERE
HIS HEAD DID NOT MOVE TO THE RIGHT
SO IT RIGIDLY COUPLES TO YOUR SKULL AND GIVES YOU THE MOST PRECISE POSSIBLE MEASUREMENT OF HOW THE SKULL MOVES
PEOPLE HAVE TRIED OTHER APPROACHES WITH HELMETS
THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT THINGS
WELL THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT THINGS
SURELY IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO ADDRESS THAT
YOU JUST PICK OUT YOURS AND YOU CAN GO HOME
THANKS VERY MUCH
AND THAT SEXUALITY IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF WHO WE ARE AND IT'S NORMAL AND
WE HAVE TO MAKE A WORLD WHERE WHAT'S BETWEEN OUR LEGS AND THE WAY WE USE IT IS NOT USED TO CREATE
IF YOU CAN JUST GO IN THE BACK THEY ARE ALL THERE
FROM THE MOMENT WE'RE BORN TO THE MOMENT WE DIE EVERY MINUTE OF EVERY DAY
OUR SEXUALITY IS A FUNDAMENTAL FACET OF OUR HUMANITY
OKAY HOW ABOUT THIS ONE HOW ABOUT
AND I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE SOMETHING WITH YOU IN CLOSING
FOUR YEARS OLD DE RIHYA
BUT HE WOULDN'T STOP
I WAS FIGHTING THAT PROCESS
BUT I MANAGED TO MAKE ROOM FOR A COPY OF THE COP 21 AGREEMENT THAT FRENCH PRESIDENT
AND SO SHE SLEEPS
WHAT TIME IS IT ON MARS
AND THAT WAS BECAUSE AGAIN THIS EVENTUALLY BECOMES HARD
SO ONE DAY YOU COME IN AT 8
SO THEY LIVED ON MARS TIME FOR A MONTH AND HAD THESE GREAT ADVENTURES LIKE GOING BOWLING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
SO OUR DAY IS 24 HOURS
EVENTUALLY WE'LL MOVE TO A MODIFIED MARS TIME WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE WORKING NOW
THIS TEAM NEEDS TO BE AT WORK AT 5
WILL I WAKE THEM UP
YEAH NOT SO MUCH
SO YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW CONFUSING THAT IS
AND THEY WERE ON DAD'S WORK SCHEDULE
AND WHY ARE YOU AT MY RESTAURANT AT 3
BUT WE DON'T STAY ON MARS TIME FOR MORE THAN THREE TO FOUR MONTHS
WAIT WHAT TIME IS IT IN CALIFORNIA
40 THE NEXT DAY 40 MINUTES LATER AT 9
20 THE NEXT DAY AT 10
SO THOSE OF US WHO WERE ON MARS TIME WOULD REFER TO OURSELVES AS MARTIANS AND
AND THEY HAD ABOUT 30 OF US THAT THEY WOULD DO SLEEP DEPRIVATION EXPERIMENTS ON
OUR JOB THE JOB OF THIS TEAM OF WHICH I'M A PART OF IS TO SEND COMMANDS TO THE ROVER
IS IT OK TO CALL
AND THESE ROVERS ARE OUR ROBOTIC EMISSARIES
SO WE LEARN HOW TO OPERATE ON OTHER PLANETS THROUGH THESE ROVERS
IT WAS A HUGE BONDING EXPERIENCE WITH THE OTHER MEMBERS ON THE TEAM BUT IT IS
00 IN THE MORNING
THIS IS A WONDERFUL THING FOR US
IT'S THERE FOR US TO HAVE BUT WE'VE GOT TO SOLVE THIS CHOKE POINT AND IT'S GOING TO CHANGE YOUR LIVES SO IT'S WORTH
IN FACT IT STARTED TO DRIVE THE RECALL THE COMPLEXITY OF THAT SOFTWARE STARTED TO DRIVE OUR RECALLS
WE NEEDED A BREAKTHROUGH
YOU'VE SEEN THEM I THINK ON YACHTS RIGHT
YOU'VE SEEN THESE THINGS ON BOATS
SO THERE'S NO TIME TO LOSE
THESE CORALS DIDN'T STARVE TO DEATH IN MARCH THEY ACTUALLY COOKED
AND WE'VE SEEN CORALS THAT WE WOULD NORMALLY EXPECT TO BE WINNERS DURING A BLEACHING EVENT TO ACTUALLY HAVE
BUT THESE LONGER LIVED CORALS TAKE MUCH MUCH LONGER
NOT IS IT JUST VALUABLE
I NEED A DRINK WITH MY LUNCH
IT'S GETTING THEM WRONG THAT IS LIVING
BUT THE POWDER IS LABELED DEADLY POISON SO GRACE THINKS THAT THE POWDER IS A DEADLY POISON
THE CHANGES I SHOWED YOU ARE IMPRESSIVE TO ME BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY TELL US ABOUT THE FUNCTION OF THE BRAIN BUT THEY'RE SMALL
SO THIS BRAIN REGION IS CALLED THE RIGHT TPJ
RS THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT
SO IT'S NOT A SURREPTITIOUS TECHNOLOGY
THIS SYSTEM TAKES A LONG TIME TO DEVELOP SLOWLY THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF CHILDHOOD AND INTO EARLY ADOLESCENCE
AND WE CAN USE THAT SAME PULSE NOW APPLIED TO THE RTPJ TO ASK IF WE CAN CHANGE PEOPLE'S MORAL
IT'S QUITE HARD ACTUALLY TO GET THOSE VERY SMALL CHANGES
AND WHAT WE CHANGED WAS NOT PEOPLE'S MORAL JUDGMENTS WHEN THEY'RE DECIDING WHAT TO DO WHEN THEY'RE MAKING ACTION
WHY DOES IT SEEM TO REQUIRE THESE BEINGS WHO SENSE THINGS FOR US TO OPERATE
ONE IS THAT YOU CAN'T BE TMSED WITHOUT KNOWING IT
THIS IS A TOOL THAT LETS US PASS A MAGNETIC PULSE THROUGH SOMEBODY'S SKULL INTO A SMALL REGION OF THEIR BRAIN
AND SO I THINK OF WHAT I'M DOING NOT SO MUCH AS STUDYING THE DEFENDANT IN A CRIMINAL TRIAL BUT STUDYING THE JURY
IT TAKES CHILDREN A LONG TIME TO BREAK INTO THE SYSTEM
AND THAT PROBLEM IS HOW IS IT SO EASY TO KNOW OTHER MINDS
SO FIRST THE FIRST THING I WANT TO TELL YOU IS THAT THERE IS A BRAIN REGION IN THE HUMAN BRAIN IN YOUR BRAINS WHOSE
THIS IS A PICTURE OF IT
WE CHANGED THEIR ABILITY TO JUDGE OTHER PEOPLE'S ACTIONS
I PARTIED A LOT AND WAS A PRETTY SELFISH GUY
AND I STARTED SEARCHING FOR THOSE THINGS THAT MAKE LIFE WORTH LIVING
THEY MAKE THEM FEEL INVISIBLE AND UNWORTHY
BUT IT GAVE THEM A PURPOSE TO REIN IN THE EGO
AS EACH DAY GOES BY WE'RE CONSTANTLY CREATING OUR LIVES ADDING TO OUR STORY
LOOKING BACK I NOW REALIZE THAT THE SUFI HOUSE HAD A REAL CULTURE OF MEANING
IT'S AN ONGOING PROCESS
I MET A YOUNG MAN NAMED EMEKA WHO'D BEEN PARALYZED PLAYING FOOTBALL
BUT SOME GROUPS AND RELATIONSHIPS DELIVER A CHEAP FORM OF BELONGING YOU'RE VALUED FOR WHAT YOU
EACH MORNING MY FRIEND JONATHAN BUYS A NEWSPAPER FROM THE SAME STREET VENDOR IN NEW YORK
I'LL WALK BY SOMEONE I KNOW AND BARELY ACKNOWLEDGE THEM
I HAD TO RUSH HOME
IF WE REALLY HAD SUCH GREAT SUCCESS WITH THE EARLY GENERATION ANTIBIOTICS HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT WE
YOUR MICROBIOME IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL FOR YOUR HEALTH
BUT THAT FIGHT IS NOT OCCURRING IN ISOLATION
IT FELT LIKE I COULDN'T GET THERE FAST ENOUGH
BUT IF YOU LEAVE HERE WITH ONE THING TODAY I WANT YOU TO LEAVE HERE BELIEVING THAT THERE IS HOPE TO GET US OUT OF
WE PUT ALL OUR EFFORTS INTO DEVELOPING WEAPONS IN THE FORM OF ANTIBIOTICS AND ANTIVIRALS
WE HAVE TO MAKE THAT SHIFT BECAUSE IT'S ONLY THEN WHEN WE'LL TRULY BE ABLE TO CLOSE THE
BUT THAT COMBAT DOES NOT OCCUR IN ISOLATION
BUT AFTER I HEARD HIS SYMPTOMS I KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HAD HAPPENED
THE SCARY FACT IS IT'S AN ARMS RACE WE CAN NEVER WIN
I HAD TO GET TO THE HOSPITAL TO BE WITH HIM AND TO TALK WITH HIS DOCTORS
HOW DO WE FIGHT INFECTIONS
I SAT THERE FOR A WEEK WITH MY DAD AND I CAN REMEMBER OBSESSIVELY WATCHING HIS VITALS MONITORS
WE ARE ALL TERRIFIED OF THAT THREAT
I WAS CERTAIN THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE GONE BY THE TIME I GOT TO THE HOSPITAL
AS A RESULT WE DECLARED A WAR AGAINST INFECTIOUS DISEASES
BUT BACTERIA AND VIRUSES ARE INCREDIBLY SLIPPERY TARGETS
I THINK THAT'S AMAZING
I KNOW THAT A SINGLE WORD CHANGE FROM FIGHT TO SURVIVE SEEMS SIMPLE BUT BY MAKING THE SINGLE
IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT THE MICROBES HAVE EVOLVED RESISTANCE TO OUR NEW WEAPONS
SO IF WE'VE BEEN ASKING THE WRONG QUESTION WHAT IS THE QUESTION THAT WE SHOULD BE ASKING
IT PROTECTS US FROM MORTALITY BY PREVENTING AND FIXING THE COLLATERAL DAMAGE THAT
THE FIRST STEP TO THIS IS REALLY CHANGING OUR PERSPECTIVE GOING FROM HOW DO WE FIGHT
WE TAKE A VARIETY OF APPROACHES TO ADDRESS THIS GOAL BUT ONE OF OUR MAIN APPROACHES THAT WE'RE REALLY EXCITED
IF YOU HAVE A MOUSE IN YOUR HOUSE YOU SET TRAPS TO TRY TO KILL THAT MOUSE
THEN I HAD TO BATTLE BAY AREA TRAFFIC FOR OVER TWO HOURS
THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU WATCH MOVIES LIKE CONTAGION OR OUTBREAK
WE ARE USING THE MICROBIOME TO TEACH US HOW TO TURN TOLERANCE DEFENSES ON TO TEACH US WHAT THEY
THEY FREAKED YOU OUT RIGHT
SOMETHING THAT CAN HAPPEN IS WHAT'S CALLED THE COLLATERAL DAMAGE OF WAR WHICH IS THE UNINTENTIONAL OR
INSTEAD OF ASKING HOW DO WE FIGHT INFECTIONS
I DROPPED EVERYTHING
WE COULDN'T IMAGINE THAT ANYTHING SERIOUS COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG
ACTUALLY NOTHING SERIOUS DID GO WRONG WITH HIS SURGERY
WE SHOULD BE ASKING HOW DO WE SURVIVE INFECTIONS
RIGHT NOW ALL OF YOU HAVE ABOUT THREE POUNDS OF BACTERIA THAT ARE LIVING ON YOU BODY SURFACES
HOW COULD 12 HOURS AGO MY DAD BE PERFECTLY HEALTHY AND DISCHARGED FROM THE HOSPITAL
WE ALL KNOW THAT OUR BODIES HAVE AN IMMUNE SYSTEM AND THIS IMMUNE SYSTEM IS IMPORTANT FOR RECOGNIZING
SO WHAT DO WE DO
BUT DONNA'S BIGGEST SUPPORTER CAME FROM AN UNEXPECTED PLACE
THANK YOU GUYS SO VERY MUCH
SOMETHING THAT WOULD STICK TO THEIR RIBS SHE SAID
MY COUSINS ALL TEACH
NOW WHAT'S HARD TO PUT TOGETHER BUT IS TRUE IS THAT MANY TIMES THESE ARE THE SAME CHILDREN
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT THE CRITICS SAID WHEN BRAVE CAME OUT
MAYBE IT'S NOT JUST THE SPARKLY DRESS
IT HAS NOT YET CAUGHT ON AND CAUGHT FIRE BUT MAYBE TODAY WE WILL START A MOVEMENT
THERE'S NO MODELS FOR THEM
AW I CAN'T BELIEVE PIXAR MADE A PRINCESS MOVIE
SO OUR SONS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO FIND SOME WAY OF ADAPTING TO THIS SOME NEW RELATIONSHIP WITH EACH OTHER AND I THINK
THEY'RE THROWING IT UP IN THE AIR
OSCAR BUZZ DOING GREAT AT THE BOX OFFICE A CONSENSUS IDEA OF WHAT A QUALITY
IT PRETTY MUCH FLUNKS THE BECHDEL TEST
I RECOMMEND IT TO ALL OF YOU
I FINISHED MY QUEST I GOT THE GIRL
WHY ARE YOU STILL STANDING THERE
THE MOVIES ARE VERY VERY FOCUSED ON DEFEATING THE VILLAIN AND GETTING YOUR REWARD AND THERE'S NOT A LOT OF ROOM
AND SO WE DECIDED TO TAKE THIS CASE TO THE SUPREME COURT
AND I NEED YOU GUYS TO PARTICIPATE HERE
SHE BECAME MY WIFE
IT WAS SO DIFFICULT
THE TERRORISTS HAVE ARRIVED
AND I WAS MAKING JOKES FROM AN HONEST PLACE AND BECAUSE I WAS UNIQUE I GOT THESE OPPORTUNITIES SO QUICKLY
WHEN I FINISH THE SENTENCE I NEED YOU GUYS TO GASP ALRIGHT
WE ARE ALL DIFFERENT AND WE ARE ALL THE SAME
EVERY SINGLE SHOW I WOULD MAKE SOME JOKE ABOUT BEING GAY
I WASN'T WRITING I WASN'T FLOWING I WAS CLOGGING MYSELF UP SO I DECIDED I WAS ON A COLLEAGE TOUR IN THE STATES
PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO HATE THEY WANT TO LOVE
DAD ISN'T THAT LETTING THE WRONG PEOPLE WIN
COMING OUT CAN BE LIKE CLIFF JUMPING
I REMEMBER I WAS HAVING A COFFEE WITH ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL COMICS IN THE COUNTRY AND THEIR ADVICE TO ME WAS STAY IN THE
THESE CHICKS BESIDE ME JUDGING
I GOT TO OPEN FOR RUSSELL PETERS I GOT TO FLY TO SOUTH AFRICA AND DO COMEDY THERE I DID TV
THERE WERE NO MINDY KALINGS OR RUSSELL PETERS THERE WERE JUST APUS FROM THE SIMPSONS
HE'D COME IN BLARING THE BOLLYWOOD TOP 40
SO I DECIDED I WAS GOING TO START DOING STAND UP WHEN I WAS 16 YEARS OLD
SOME COMICS GO FOR LAUGHTER I GO FOR THAT SPECIAL SILENCE WHERE YOU CAN HEAR ALL THE EQUIPMENT IN THE ROOM
TWO MORE HAD APPLIED FOR HOUSING
IT WAS THIS MAN WHO ALMOST IMPLEMENTED A MODEST BASIC INCOME AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 70S IN THE UNITED
AND AFTER TEN OR MAYBE TWENTY YEARS IT WLL TURN OUT THAT THE INVESTMENT HAS PAID FOR ITSELF
AND WHAT DID THEY SPEND IT ON
BECAUSE OUR FOREFATHERS WORKED SO HARD TO ACHIEVE OUR CURRENT LEVEL OF PROSPERITY WE CAN NOW AFFORD TO GIVE
IDEAS CAN AND DO CHANGE THE WORLD
WELL THIS IS A GREAT IDEA
I THINK ABOUT 99 OF YOU WOULD SAY
IN FACT HISTORY IS RULED BY LITTLE ELSE
THE BASIC INCOME MAY NOT BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE NEXT 3 OR 4 YEARS BUT IT MAY BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE NEXT
ABOUT 99 OF YOU WOULD SAY
OF COURSE NOT
IT'S ACTUALLY NOT MY IDEA
NO ONE'S GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO WITH IT NO ONE'S GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO FOR IT
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOOD FOR YOU
WHAT HAPPENED IN THE FIRST PLACE WAS THAT THE MEN TURNED OUT TO BE EXTREMELY FRUGAL WITH THE MONEY THEY RECEIVED
WE LOVE YOU
YOU'RE GOING TO WRITE THE NEXT CHAPTER IN HISTORY
THANK YOU SO MUCH
AND THIS SCHOOL NAMED AFTER THE U
DURING MY VISIT I'VE BEEN ESPECIALLY HONORED TO MEET SOME OF BRITAIN'S MOST EXTRAORDINARY WOMEN
THE MEN IN MY LIFE TAUGHT ME SOME IMPORTANT THINGS AS WELL
BUT WHEN WE MET BARACK WAS A COMMUNITY ORGANIZER
WE'RE INCREDIBLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS DISCOVERY
WE THINK WE'RE WELL ON OUR WAY
HERE I AM NOW A PROFESSOR OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY AND PHARMACOLOGY
WE CAN'T TELL WHERE PAIN ORIGINATES FROM
OH SURE IF YOU HAVE A BROKEN BONE THAT'S PROBABLY WHERE THE PAIN IS COMING FROM
AND IT TURNS OUT PEOPLE DID NOT LIKE GOING TO THOSE OPEN SPACES
WHAT WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND IS TO IMAGINE THIS GREAT LIFE
I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE
AS YOU SEE KNOWING YOUR VALUES GUIDES YOU TO MAKE CHOICES IN YOUR LIFE
YOU CAN TAKE SOME NOTES
SHE WORKED IN A BUSINESS BUT PEOPLE HATED WORKING FOR HER
DR BRUCE LIPTON IN HIS BESTSELLER BIOLOGY OF BELIEF TALKS ABOUT HOW BELIEFS IMPACT US
IT'S PRETTY AWESOME
I WANTED TO SPEAK UP BUT I JUST FELT LIKE I COULDN'T
SO IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THESE HIGH STAKES TESTS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO A
BAD CHILD I TOLD YOU NOT TO JUMP FROM THAT TABLE
WE HAVE A CASCADE OF PRINCIPALS FEARFUL OF THEIR JOBS OTHER ADMINISTRATORS FEARFUL
WHAT IS THE EXPERIENCE THAT THE CHILD BRINGS TO SCHOOL
THE BECOMING IS THE CREATIVE PART OF THE BRAIN
ONE CHILD MIGHT RESPOND TO MY BROKEN ARM
A DIFFERENT CHILD MIGHT RESPOND TO THE SAME SITUATION
HE TOLD ME THAT HE DIDN'T WANT ME TO LEAVE FEELING DISAPPOINTED DUE TO SOME OF WHAT I
AND THEN I WOULD TELL THEM ABOUT MALAKWANG A FANCY VEGETABLE DISH FROM MY
IT MAKES FOR A BETTER MEAL
IT'S NOT VERY HEAVY I CAN DO IT WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM BUT NONETHELESS I LIKE TO HOLD ONTO IT
IN FACT THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY'VE DONE ANYTHING WRONG
I DON'T KNOW
IS THAT EVEN ETHICAL
AND THAT WAS A RED FLAG FOR ME BECAUSE THAT'S MY AREA OF SPECIALTY AND I THOUGHT MAYBE THERE'S A WAY IN WHICH WE CAN
THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY A BAD UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE
THIS I CANNOT TREAT
HE HAD TO HAVE SOME MISTAKES
SO THEY ARE PARTLY PREDICTABLE BUT THERE'S A LOT OF RANDOMNESS AND UNCERTAINTY INSIDE
FOR EXAMPLE 130000 ARTICLES FIVE PRODUCTIZES THREE STORAGE LOCATIONS TWO PREDICTIONS
WHAT ARE ALL THE CHALLENGES THAT MIGHT GET IN THE WAY
THERE ARE OVER 200 KINDS OF CANCER
BUT IT TURNS OUT THERE ARE LOTS OF OTHER FOLKS THAT WOULD BE INTERESTED
COULD WE HAVE PEOPLE SINGING TOGETHER IN REAL TIME
AND WITH THE HELP OF SKYPE THAT IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO ATTEMPT TODAY
HE HADN'T ALWAYS BEEN A HOLOCAUST DENIER BUT IN THE LATE 80S HE EMBRACED IT WITH GREAT
BUT HERE WAS THE PROBLEM
AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVEN'T SEEN DENIAL SPOILER ALERT
I PUBLISHED MY WORK THE BOOK WAS PUBLISHED DENYING THE HOLOCAUST
IPSO FACTO I DAVID IRVING AM NOT A HOLOCAUST DENIER
WE MUST HOLD THEIR FEET TO THE FIRE
NOT IN MOST CASES AND NOT IN THE PREPONDERANCE OF CASES BUT IN EVERY SINGLE INSTANCE WHERE HE MADE SOME
WE SHOWED A PATTERN IN OVER 25 DIFFERENT MAJOR INSTANCES
THE TIME TO FIGHT IS SHORT
I'M REMINDED OF A NEW YORKER CARTOON
THIS WAS NOT A MAN WHO SEEMED AT ALL ASHAMED OR RETICENT ABOUT BEING A HOLOCAUST DENIER
HIS VIEW OF HISTORY WAS TENDENTIOUS HE LIED HE DISTORTED AND MOST
THE GROWING ASSAULT ON TRUTH AND MEMORY IT CAME OUT IN MANY DIFFERENT COUNTRIES INCLUDING HERE IN PENGUIN UK
THE ELVIS IS ALIVE PEOPLE
THEY ARE THE SAME
WHAT DID THEY HAVE
I ALSO MIST HIS HOME EVERYDAY
WAIT FOR IT
PETE BEACH FLORIDA AND WHEN I ARRIVED I FOUND ABOUT THREE APARTMENTS' WORTH OF STUFF CRAMMED IN A
I KNOW MOM CERTAINLY DID
BUT TO PUT THAT INTO PERSPECTIVE WE ESTIMATE THAT 80 BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IS THE COST THAT THE
I FIRST WANT TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE OF FOOD WASTE BUT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO
WE CAN CREATE A NEW MARKET THAT ALLOWS FOOD THAT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN WASTED AT THE FARM TO BE TRANSFERRED FROM
THE SCALE OF THE MARKET MEANS THAT THOSE THAT CRACK THIS ISSUE ARE GOING TO CREATE TREMENDOUS VALUE
AND THIS IS SOMETHING I RECOMMEND EVERYONE IN THIS AUDIENCE DO
BUT YEAH IT'S ALL THERE
THOSE DASHBOARDS THE TEACHERS HAVE YOU CAN GO LOG IN RIGHT NOW AND YOU CAN ESSENTIALLY BECOME A COACH FOR
ONCE AGAIN I DIDN'T EXPECT IT TO BE USED IN CLASSROOMS
THEY CAN WATCH AT THEIR OWN TIME AND PACE
NO WE HAVE AN AWESOME TEAM WORKING ON IT
I HAVE TO BE CLEAR IT'S NOT JUST ME ANYMORE
AND EFFICIENT TO WHOM
WOMEN WHO ARE NOT CIRCUMCISED GET ITCHY ALL THE TIME
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY FOR THAT
ARE THEY YOUR NEW FRIENDS KHADIJA
IT'S VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN
IT'S NOT AN AFRICAN PROBLEM
I'M LIKE NO WHY WOULD I GET ITCHY DOWN THERE
MEN DO YOU NEED MORE THAN ONE WIFE
THIS HAD HAPPENED TO EVERYBODY ELSE
I WAS THINKING I'M MUTILATED
AND SO EVEN THOUGH WE'RE DOING LESS PER FISH TO BRING IT TO THE MARKET WE'RE STILL
EVERY TIME I DO A NEW STORY SOMEBODY TELLS ME WE CAN DO ALL THAT
I WANT TO DO A HULA BURGER AND THERE'S GOING TO BE A SLICE OF PINEAPPLE ON A BUN
THIS EXISTS KIND OF ON PAPER
IT'S ACTUALLY A TREMENDOUSLY SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION IT GOES FROM AN EGG TO AN ADULT IN NINE MONTHS
THIS IS THE WAY WE'VE BEEN FISHING THE OCEANS OVER THE LAST 50 YEARS
WORLD WAR II WAS A TREMENDOUS INCENTIVE TO ARM OURSELVES IN A WAR AGAINST FISH
WELL THAT'S ONLY HALF THE STORY
WHEN WE WERE FLYING OVER THE SAHARA AND INDIA IT WAS NICE HOLIDAYS
YOU NEED 64 METER WINGSPAN
WHAT DO YOU REALLY WANT
THAT'S THE MOMENT WHEN YOU HAVE TO WAKE UP FROM THE AUTOMATIC WAY OF THINKING
AND THIS IS POSSIBLE
YOU KNOW WITH THE TECHNOLOGIES WE HAVE TODAY WE CAN SAVE BETWEEN 30 AND 50 PERCENT OF THE ENERGY OF A
WE SLOWED DOWN
THROWING OVERBOARD AS BALLAST TO CHANGE OUR DIRECTION
WE FLY TWICE THE SPEED YOU PREDICTED
CHALLENGE AS AN EXAMPLE
BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT'S A MYTH
TWO WEEKS LATER THE DIRECTOR CAME BACK AND SAID LET'S PUT IN THOSE FEW SECONDS OF FILM
AS THE NEED FOR A SOLUTION BECAME MORE URGENT AND AS THE DATA OR THE EVIDENCE BEGAN TO COME
WE ENDED UP WITH PAGES AND PAGES OF FIELD NOTES THAT WE ANALYZED AND LOOKED FOR PATTERNS IN WHAT
ON THE CONTRARY IT TAKES ABOUT 250 PEOPLE FOUR TO FIVE YEARS TO MAKE ONE OF THOSE
HOW DID HE SEE HIS ROLE
HE ADMITTED IF YOU HAD FORCED US TO ALL BE ON ONE TEAM WE MIGHT HAVE FOCUSED ON PROVING WHO WAS RIGHT
THE HEAD OF THE ENGINEERING GROUP AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE GROUP AT THAT TIME WAS A MAN NAMED BILL COUGHRAN
THEY UNDERSTAND THAT INNOVATION RARELY HAPPENS UNLESS YOU HAVE BOTH DIVERSITY AND
THEY WANT TO CO CREATE WITH ME THE FUTURE
LET ME GIVE YOU ANOTHER EXAMPLE
THIS IS ABOUT DOING DECISION MAKING IN A WAY THAT YOU CAN COMBINE EVEN OPPOSABLE IDEAS TO
IF SOME OF YOU ARE WORRYING NOW THAT YOU DON'T WORK AT A PIXAR OR YOU DON'T WORK AT A GOOGLE I WANT TO TELL YOU THERE'S STILL HOPE
IN THE 20 YEARS HENCE THEY'VE PRODUCED 14 MOVIES
THE FINAL CAPABILITY IS CREATIVE RESOLUTION
LET'S THINK FOR A MINUTE ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE A PIXAR MOVIE
CREATIVE ABRASION IS NOT ABOUT BRAINSTORMING WHERE PEOPLE SUSPEND THEIR JUDGMENT
WHEN THE DIRECTOR SAW THAT DRAWING HE THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT
BUT AS THE PROCESS UNFOLDED HE BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND THE WISDOM OF ALLOWING TALENTED PEOPLE TO PLAY OUT
PARTWAY THROUGH ONE PRODUCTION AN ANIMATOR DREW A CHARACTER WITH AN ARCHED EYEBROW THAT SUGGESTED A
SO THEY BEGAN TO WORK ON THAT
MY JOB IS TO NURTURE THE BOTTOM UP AND NOT LET IT DEGENERATE INTO CHAOS
THEY ALSO LEARN HOW TO ADVOCATE FOR THEIR POINT OF VIEW
IT'S ABOUT DISCOVERY DRIVEN LEARNING WHERE YOU ACT AS OPPOSED TO PLAN YOUR WAY TO THE FUTURE
EARLY IN THAT PROCESS ONE OF THE ENGINEERS HAD GONE TO BILL AND SAID WE'RE ALL TOO BUSY FOR THIS INEFFICIENT
WHAT DO THEY FOCUS THEIR TIME ON
WHEN THEY DON'T WORK SOMEONE OR SOMETHING IS TO BLAME
BUT IF I'M TRYING TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S TRULY NEW I HAVE NO ANSWERS
IT'S BECAUSE THEY HAVE MASTERED THE CAPABILITIES REQUIRED FOR THAT
SEPARATELY THESE TWO TEAMS WERE ALLOWED TO WORK FULL TIME ON THEIR PARTICULAR APPROACH
BECAUSE THAT ANIMATOR WAS ALLOWED TO SHARE WHAT WE REFER TO AS HIS SLICE OF GENIUS HE WAS ABLE
WE STUDIED A GENERAL COUNSEL IN A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY WHO HAD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THE OUTSIDE LAWYERS
LET'S PUT IN A POLICY THAT ANYONE NO MATTER WHAT THEIR LEVEL OR ROLE IS ALLOWED TO GIVE NOTES TO THE DIRECTOR ABOUT HOW
THEY DON'T ALL GO THROUGH IN ORDER
I'M NEVER A DICTATOR OF VIEWPOINTS
SO THEY SELECTED THAT ONE
PILOTS ARE OFTEN ABOUT BEING RIGHT
THEY DON'T LET ONE GROUP OR ONE INDIVIDUAL DOMINATE EVEN IF IT'S THE BOSS EVEN IF
WHEN WE MET VINEET HIS COMPANY WAS ABOUT IN HIS WORDS TO BECOME IRRELEVANT
AND THAT EXAMPLE IS THE INFRASTRUCTURE GROUP OF GOOGLE
WHEN MANY OF US THINK ABOUT INNOVATION THOUGH WE THINK ABOUT AN EINSTEIN HAVING AN AHA
THEY STOPPED GIVING ANSWERS THEY STOPPED TRYING TO PROVIDE SOLUTIONS
IT CAN BE A PROCESS OR A WAY OF ORGANIZING
BUT VERY FEW OF YOU RECOGNIZED ED CATMULL THE FOUNDER AND CEO OF PIXAR ONE OF THE
WE WATCHED AS HE TURNED THAT COMPANY INTO A GLOBAL DYNAMO OF IT
BUT IF WE WANT TO BUILD ORGANIZATIONS THAT CAN INNOVATE TIME AND AGAIN WE MUST RECAST OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT LEADERSHIP
BILL SAID I LEAD A VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATION
IN ENGINEERING REVIEWS BILL DESCRIBED HIS ROLE AS INJECTING HONESTY INTO THE PROCESS
COMPUTER GENERATED MOVIES ARE REALLY MAINSTREAM TODAY BUT IT TOOK ED AND HIS COLLEAGUES NEARLY 20 YEARS TO
INSTEAD OF CREATING A GROUP TO TACKLE THIS TASK THEY DECIDED TO ALLOW GROUPS TO EMERGE
NOT ON CREATING A VISION
IT'S ABOUT RUNNING A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS AND NOT A SERIES OF PILOTS
WE CAN MOVE OTHER LIVING THINGS OUT OF THE WAY
THANK YOU ALL
HOW WE MIGHT FOSTER THAT
I THINK WE NEED TO JUST RESTORE THAT KIND OF VALUE INTO ALL OF OUR LIVES
BUT WE ALSO NEED TO BE ABLE TO BUILD AND RESTORE
HOW DO WE NEED TO BEHAVE
INNOVATIONS THAT WE'VE CREATED AS HUMAN BEINGS COME DOWN TO THE THINGS THAT WE VALUE AND
THAT IS A MICROCOSM OF ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON IN THE REST OF THE WORLD
IN OTHER WORDS LEARNS HOW TO GET ALONG WITH EACH OTHER AND BECOMES INTERDEPENDENT WITH EVERY OTHER LIVING THING
WE ALL BECAME THE PEOPLE WE ARE THANKS TO POSITIVE STRENGTH THANKS TO SOMEONE WHO TOLD
I'M NOT DRIVING THE COUNTRY IN A CAR FULL OF BALLOONS
I'VE SEEN YOU
WHEN YOU SMOKE YOU GET LUNG CANCER
THEY TURNED AN OLD VEGETABLE BOX UPSIDE DOWN I'M STANDING ON IT RECITING A POEM AND I HOPEFULLY GET AN ICE CREAM
NAMASTE MEANS THREE THINGS
LIFE IS NOT A PARTY
I BOW DEEPLY FOR THAT
WE KNOW THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OPTIMISM AND HAPPINESS IS QUITE
WHEN YOU ARE AN OPTIMIST YOU BECOME HAPPY
WE ALL HAVE THAT
I'VE SEEN YOU
THERE IS A POSITIVE STRENGTH IN YOU
WE ALL ARE AMBASSADORS OF SOME STRENGTH
THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS
I WOULD BE STANDING ON IT AND RECITE POEMS
AND THEN I GOT AN ICE CREAM
I GOT LOTS OF ICE CREAM IN MY YOUTH
AND WHEN YOU'RE HAPPIER YOU'RE HEALTHIER AND SUCCESSFUL IN SPORTS IN SCIENCE IN FRIENDSHIP
THESE MAN MADE STRUCTURES DEEPLY AFFECTED NOT ONLY MY SENSE OF SPACE LINES
BUT BY ASKING LAURAN QUESTIONS IT ALLOWED US TO USE DIALOGUE TO GET TO A PLACE OF TRUE UNDERSTANDING
I COULD TAKE THE EASY WAY OUT AND JUST CHOOSE NOT TO SAY ANYTHING TO HER AND INSTEAD JUST KIND OF SIMMER IN
AND YOU'RE RIGHT THERE WERE SOME TERRIBLE THINGS THAT CAME OUT DURING THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN SO MUCH SO THAT I ALMOST
AND FRANKLY MY ASSUMPTIONS WERE WRONG
AND SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE WE DECIDED WE DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE ANY TOPIC BE OFF LIMITS FOR DISCUSSION EVEN IF
IT IS SO EASY TO GET EMOTIONALLY FIRED UP ABOUT ISSUES THAT WE'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT AND WE CAN LET OUR EGO
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY LAURAN WOULD CHOOSE TO HAVE THEM PARTICIPATE IN THAT WAY AND I ASSUMED IT WASN'T A CHOICE THAT THE BOYS MADE FOR
AND YEARS AFTER I LEFT COVENANT HOUSE HE WAS STILL WORKING THERE
THEY ASK THESE KINDS OF QUESTIONS ON THEIR OWN
SO WE'LL USE EVEN SIMPLE THINGS LIKE ARNOLD LOBEL'S FROG AND TOAD ADVENTURES
WE WANT TO ENHANCE THEIR COGNITIVE SKILLS
AND IT'S OUR JOB TO HELP GIVE THEM UPTAKE ON THOSE QUESTIONS
SO THESE ARE THE KINDS OF QUESTIONS THAT PHILOSOPHERS ASK AND LIKE I SAID I THINK KIDS ASK THEM VERY NATURALLY
WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THAT THING
HOW WOULD WE KNOW IF IT DOES
OVER THE COURSE OF TIME MAYBE FIVE YEARS YOU ACTUALLY REPLACE EVERY SINGLE BOARD OR EVERY SINGLE PART OF THE BOAT
AND THE RESULT IS THAT KIDS THINK THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT DON'T MATTER
THOSE ARE GOOD SKILLS THAT ARE GOING TO DO WELL FOR THEM IN OTHER KINDS OF ENDEAVORS AS WELL
AND IT'S AMAZING WHAT THEY COME UP WITH
SAY WHAT IT IS AND SHOW HOW IT MEETS THAT PERSON'S CLAIM
SO WHAT ARE PHILOSOPHERS KNOWN FOR
AND WHAT WE'VE FOUND NOT ONLY IN OUR OWN WORK WHERE KIDS REALLY ENJOY IT AND LOVE IT BUT IN WORK DONE AROUND THE
AND WHAT ALLOWS US TO MAKE THAT KIND OF CLAIM
PHILOSOPHY IS UNDERSTOOD TO BE A DEEP ABSTRACT RIGOROUS DIFFICULT KIND OF DISCIPLINE
WE NEED TO ENGAGE KIDS ON THE QUESTIONS THAT THEY HAVE
IF WE ARE BOTH DETERMINED AND FREE
I THINK THIS IS REALLY EMPOWERING FOR THEM
AND THE BEAUTIFUL THING ABOUT THEM IS THEY DON'T TAKE ANY LAB SPACE
THEY ARE NOT WRONG BECAUSE THEY ARE PUNISHED
WE'LL TALK ABOUT BRAVERY
WHAT IS BRAVERY
THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO DO PHILOSOPHY
BUT A LOT OF PHILOSOPHERS BELIEVE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN BE FREE
IMAGINE YOU HAVE A BOAT
WE'RE CREATURES WHO CHANGE OVER TIME
LOOK AT US RUN AWAY FROM THE SNAKE BUT WE'RE BEING VERY BRAVE
AT WHAT POINT IN THIS PROCESS OF CHANGE WOULD YOU HAVE SAID AH NO YOU HAVE A NEW BOAT
WHEN I'VE GONE INTO CLASSES AND I'VE WORKED WITH THIRD GRADE UP THROUGH TWELFTH GRADE IN HIGH SCHOOL
AND IF YOU THINK IT'S NOT THE SAME BOAT WELL NOW TELL ME WHEN DID IT NOT BECOME THE SAME BOAT
IS IT STANDING UP IN THE FACE OF YOUR OWN FEAR AND DOING SOMETHING
COME UP WITH A COUNTEREXAMPLE
WHY DO YOU NOT DO THOSE THINGS WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE THE RING
AND SO WE FUMBLE RIGHT AND MAYBE WE PUT IT OFF A LITTLE BIT AND WE DON'T ACTUALLY ADDRESS THEM
ARE WE REALLY THE SAME AS OUR EARLIER SELVES
SO WE HAVE AN INTERESTING DISCUSSION WITH THE KIDS
EITHER REMAINS THE SAME OR HOW DO YOU RETAIN AN IDENTITY OVER ALL OF THIS CHANGE
THEY ARE WONDERING ABOUT WHERE THEY ARE AND HOW THE WORLD WORKS AND WHAT THEIR PLACE IS IN IT
THE ANSWERS ARE AMBIGUOUS
MOST PEOPLE THINK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY INSANE IMPOSSIBLE
THEY'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THEIR WORLD
THESE ARE THE KINDS OF PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTIONS
AND WHY DO WE START WARS
SO WE DEVELOP THESE REALLY INTERESTING DISCUSSIONS OUT OF LITERATURE OUT OF PUZZLES OUT OF THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS AND WE HAVE
CRITICAL THINKING RIGHT
EVEN CAN YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW THAT YOU'RE NOT DREAMING
AND THEN STARTING WITH THE BOAT WE CAN TRANSLATE THAT INTO A DISCUSSION ABOUT PERSONAL IDENTITY HUMAN IDENTITY
WE DON'T NEED BEAKERS OR CHEMICALS THERE'S NO SAFETY TRAINING
WE'RE INCREASINGLY GETTING FUNNELED IN THAT DIRECTION IN EDUCATION
IF YOU THINK IT IS THE SAME BOAT WHY
ONE OF THE GREATEST THINGS IS YOU'LL GET BEST FRIENDS SAYING I NEVER REALIZED I COULD REALLY DISAGREE WITH HIM ABOUT SOMETHING
WHAT REMAINS THE SAME THROUGH THAT PROCESS OF CHANGE OVER TIME
BUT THEY DO MATTER
ADULTS HAVE A MUCH HARDER TIME ASKING THEM
AND WHAT IT WOULD MEAN FOR US TO SAY THAT WE'RE FREE
OR WE'LL ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THE NATURE OF RIGHT AND WRONG
IMAGINE THAT YOU FIND A RING AND IF YOU TWIST THAT RING IT MAKES YOU INVISIBLE
AND MAKE MEANING IN IT
WE HAVE TO GET THE ARROW GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND WE CAN BUILD THESE REALLY INTERESTING DEEP CONVERSATIONS WITH KIDS
WHAT STOPS YOU
KIDS ARE ACTUALLY VERY NATURAL PHILOSOPHERS
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT EDUCATION IS ALL ABOUT
AND INITIALLY SOME KIDS WILL THINK IT'S WRONG BECAUSE WE GET PUNISHED FOR IT
AND ONCE WE FIGURE OUT WHY THEY WOULD DO
SO THEY DON'T REALLY GET UPTAKE IN THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IN PART BECAUSE TEACHERS AREN'T TRAINED TO DEAL WITH THOSE KINDS OF
BUT EVEN AT HOME I THINK OFTEN THEY DON'T GET UPTAKE
FROG AND TOAD RUN AWAY FROM A LOT OF THINGS ALL THE TIME SAYING WE'RE VERY BRAVE
BUT THEN WE CAN HELP THEM THROUGH THE PROCESS OF DISCUSSION TO COME TO SEE THAT WE PUNISH THOSE THINGS BECAUSE THEY ARE
HOW DO WE MAKE MEANING IN OUR LIVES KNOWING THAT WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE
YOUR FRIEND JUST MADE THIS CLAIM CAN YOU IMAGINE A COUNTEREXAMPLE OR A DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVE
YOU CAN'T TEACH THAT FOR THE TEST VERY EASILY
PHILOSOPHERS WANT TO KNOW FOR INSTANCE IF WE ARE REALLY FREE
SO WE ALREADY KNOW THAT THERE'S MUCH MORE WARMING COMING THAT THERE'S MUCH MORE WARMING IN THE PIPELINE
NOW YOU MIGHT ASK THAT IF THERE IS STILL TIME BEFORE CATASTROPHIC HARM MATERIALIZES
NOW IT WILL TAKE A GLOBAL PACK OF LAWYERS AND A LOT OF SUPPORT FOR LEGAL ACTION FROM YOU
IT'S THE QUESTIONS THE PROBLEM THAT'S HARD TO SEE
I'M A DADDY'S GIRL
AND DURING THOSE MOMENTS WE FOUND THAT THIS WORKS FOR ALL ADDICTIONS
SHE WROTE IT ON A 3X5 CARD AND SHE DIDN'T COMMIT TO STICK TO HER DIET STICK TO HER PLAN
BUT NO THIS ONE
WILL YOU NOT INVITE ME WILL YOU NOT MAKE FUN OF ME WHEN I DON'T
THE VITAL BEHAVIORS ARE THE ONES CONNECTED TO THE RESULT AND CARRY A LOT OF OTHER BEHAVIORS WITH IT
SHE MARRIED WHEN I WAS NINE
NOT ALL BEHAVIORS ARE THE SAME
CAN I DO IT
SHE HAD TO GO TO THEM AND SAY
WHAT IS GETTING IN THE WAY OF MY CRUCIAL MOMENT
WHY WERE YOU TEMPTED
AND WHEN SHE STARTED SAYING
I'M NOT GOING TO GO OUT ON BREAK
AND THE THINGS THAT ARE GOOD FOR YOU COST MORE MONEY
WHAT WAS THE NEW CRUCIAL MOMENT
VITAL BEHAVIOR IS WHAT WE DO
AND GAINED 440
AJ IS LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHEN THEY TRY TO QUIT SMOKING
WHEN IT COMES TO PERSONAL HABITS IT'S REALLY EASY TO SEE THE PROBLEM
AND THEY DON'T WANT IT THAT WAY
I MADE A PLAN TO CALL MY SISTER
I'M MAKING LIGHT OF THIS A LITTLE BIT
SHE WAS EMBARRASSED
JUST TIME AFTER TIME
NOBODY WANTS IT THAT WAY
BUT THAT'S NOT THE LESSON
I HAD TO MARSHALL ENOUGH OF THESE INFLUENCES
BECAUSE THIS RESEARCH IS NOT JUST SCIENTIFIC
WHAT SHE SAID WAS
I AM SO CHEAP
CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS THAT SUPPORT THAT BELIEF
CHIMPANZEES ROUTINELY FAIL AT TASKS THAT REQUIRE SHARING KNOWLEDGE AND WORKING TOGETHER TO
NOW THE POINT IS DECIDEDLY NOT THAT PEOPLE ARE STUPID
HOW DOES IT EVEN FORM
THE KEY IS SPECIALIZATION
WE LIVE IN THE ILLUSION THAT WE HAVE ARRIVED AT OUT OWN POSITIONS VIA A SERIOUS ANALYSIS AND THAT WE CAN
WE ALL BELIEVE THAT THE EARTH REVOLVES AROUND THE SUN
THE SAME IS TRUE OF PEOPLE
WE ALL KNOW IT'S TERRIBLE FOR US RIGHT
IN THAT TIME THERE WERE 75 CHIEF ENGINEERS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PROJECT AND
IT'S NATURAL TO THINK ABOUT THINKING AS WHAT HAPPENS BETWEEN YOUR EARS BUT THAT'S NOT WHERE THE MAGIC
AFTER ALL WE ALL THINK IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE WORLD TO KNOW A LOT AND HAVE GREAT
SO THAT'S THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE KNOWLEDGE SHARING STORY
HE TOLD ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT SCIENTISTS HAD NOT YET EXPLAINED WHY THE ROCKS GLOW
IT WAS AS IF THE SCIENTISTS' KNOWLEDGE HAD BEEN DIRECTLY TRANSMITTED TO THEM EVEN THOUGH IT WAS NEVER DESCRIBED
FOOD IS COLLECTED AND STORED THE HIVE IS PROTECTED FROM INTRUDERS GENETIC DIVERSITY IS INTRODUCED
ONE APPROACH HE TOOK WAS TO ANALYZE THE RESULT OF MEMORY EXPERIMENTS WHERE PEOPLE WERE ASKED TO
USING THE DATA HE WAS ABLE TO ESTIMATE THE RATE AT WHICH WE CAN ACQUIRE KNOWLEDGE AND ALSO THE RATE
THIS MAKES PERFECT SENSE THEY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE ROCKS
THEREFORE WHEN SOMEONE DOESN'T BELIEVE WHAT WE BELIEVE IT'S OBVIOUS WHAT THE PROBLEM IS
OF COURSE WE DO IT'S THE MOST BASIC FACT IN THE WORLD
YOUR FIRST INSTINCT IS TO LAUGH AT THE FLAT EARTHERS AND ASSUME THEY MUST BE INCREDIBLY DENSE OR CRAZY
IT STANDS FROM FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES THAT GOVERN THE WAY OUR MINDS WORK AND THE WAY WE STORE KNOWLEDGE
IF WE REALLY WANT TO IMPROVE THE WAY WE GRAPPLE WITH THESE CHALLENGES WE HAVE TO GO DEEPER WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT
OF COURSE WE HAVE TO TAKE POSITIONS ON ISSUES WITHOUT KNOWING EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM AND IF WE
UNSURPRISINGLY THEY SAID THEY HAD NO CLUE
CANCER DOESN'T CARE WHERE WE WORK
BUT THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF AQUAPONICS PROGRAMS IN PRISON WE ARE STARTING TO SEE SOME OF THESE CYCLES
WE BOUGHT THAT T SHIRT WE DANCED THAT DANCE
IT'S ABOUT LEARNING ABOUT YOURSELF HOW TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF
THIS OLD FORTRESS ISLAND OFF THE COAST OF HELSINKI
AND WE DID THAT
AT THIS POINT SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES JUST WENT CRAZY
THAT WAS TOO FAR FOR US SO WE ASK OUR BOSS IN JYV SKYL IF SHE COULD DO THE SNOOPING FOR US
THE BRAIN PROVIDES US WITH THE BIOLOGICAL CAPACITY TO ACQUIRE SPEECH
IT IS CAPTURING THIS DYNAMIC VARIATION IN RESPONSE TO THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE
THERE'RE OVER 3000 COUNTY COURT HOUSES AROUND THE COUNTRY ALL OF THEM WITH PEOPLE SITTING FOR HOURS MOSTLY
CHARITIES ARE HAPPY TO ASK FOR OUR TIME TO HELP THEM FUND RAISE RIGHT
AND SOMETIMES WITH THE BEST OF INTENTIONS
HERE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT FRACTIONS
IF YOU'RE A FAMILY MEMBER CARING FOR CHILD OR AN AGING PARENT YOU'RE PRODUCING SOMETHING THERE'S A VALUE
NOT EVEN JUST TO DO WELL ON THIS TEST BUT ACTUALLY TO LEARN THE SKILLS
WE NEVER POSSESS SOME OF THAT MONEY TO BEGIN WITH SO WE DON'T HAVE TO HAND IT BACK
AND IN MOST CASES THE NUMBERS ARE ALL OUT THERE WAITING FOR US
AND THAT'S WHAT WAS DRIVING IT
AND WHAT IS THE MATH HERE
WE JUST KEEP DOING MORE LAUNDRY
IF YOU HAVE A JOB THE MARKET HAS PUT A VALUE ON THAT
AND THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF NUMBERS THAT WHISTLE BY US ALL THE TIME THAT WE ARE NOT THINKING ABOUT IT
IT'S MULTIPLYING YOUR TIME BY THE DOLLARS PER HOUR
LOOK AT THE VOLUNTEERING WORLD
THAT FRACTION OF A GALLON IS NOT THE SWING VOTE HERE
BUT WHY DON'T WE THINK ABOUT IT
WE DON'T SENSE HOW THE NUMBERS PILE UP
THAT'S WHY IT'S SO ADMIRABLE THAT SAL KHAN AT KHAN ACADEMY AND DAVID COLEMAN AT THE COLLEGE BOARD ARE WORKING TO HAVE
THE KIDS KEEP GETTING BIGGER AND DIRTIER
WE JUST HAVE TO DO THE MATH
BECAUSE TAKING ONE FIFTH MAKES US NERVOUS
IF WE ARE AWARE OF THAT WE CAN MAKE THE BETTER DECISIONS
THEY'RE BEING READ TO SOMETIMES 10000 MORE HOURS BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS KNOW TO DO THAT AND CAN AFFORD TO
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A VALUE TO VOLUNTEERING
VOLUNTEERS HAVE VALUE
EVERYBODY'S TIME IS WORTH SOMETHING
TEST PREP IS ALL THAT'S LEFT
AND I WAS STUNNED BY WHAT I FOUND
SO WHAT'S THE MATH WE TALK ABOUT HERE
BECAUSE THIS'S HOW WE TURN AROUND SOCIETY
IT REALLY STARTS TO RACK UP
AND IT TURNS OUT THAT THAT LACK OF AWARENESS OF NUMBERS PERVADES ALL KINDS OF ACTIONS WE TAKE AND
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT RIGHT
SO HOW DO WE TURN THIS AROUND
50 HOURS OF TEST PREP IS NOT GOING TO TURN IT AROUND
WHEN YOU DO THE MATH YOU START TO SEE HOW THINGS PILE UP
JUST UNDERSTANDING PARTS OF THE WHOLE
AND THAT IS BECAUSE WE DON'T SEE HOW SMALL NUMBERS PILE UP INTO THE BIG ONES WE DON'T SEE HOW SMALL NUMBERS
AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE
AND IF YOU DO FIND OUT YOU MIGHT BE ALARMED TO LEARN THIS POLICY IS AGAINST YOUR WISHES WHATEVER THAT WISH MAY
IF YOU ARE IN CHARGE OF PEOPLE RISKING THEIR LIVES IN SERVICE COPS SOLDIERS FIRE FIGHTERS
PUSH TO CHANGE CURRENT POLICIES AND LAWS
AND THIS IS WHERE I WAS
AND ON THIS JOURNEY IT WAS ABOUT 40 HOURS ACTUALLY AND BELIEVE ME NOBODY HAD A
WHAT ARE YOU BRINGING ON BOARD
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WHAT ARE YOUR SKILLS
WHERE ARE YOUR TALENTS
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE IN THE PAST
BUT I DIDN'T ORDER ALL OF THAT AND THE BILL CAME UP TO WHAT AT THE TIME WAS AN ENTIRE MONTH'S RENT FOR ME
AND SO IN MY DRUNKEN STATE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I DID
AND I SAID NO I DON'T
IT'S ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS THAT I FOUND OUT
AND WHAT THAT ALLOWED ME TO DO WAS TO GO BACK IN AND FROM THIS ENORMOUS POOL OF MEN APPLY MY
SO HE ORDERED ALL KINDS OF DISHES THE MOST EXPENSIVE BOTTLE OF WINE ON THE MENU AND WHEN THE BILL CAME HE
WELL A YEAR AFTER THAT FIRST DATE WE WERE TRAVELING IN PETRA JORDAN
OUTSIDE THE RESTAURANT HE TRIED TO SHAKE MY HAND AND I SAID THIS IS INTERESTING THANK YOU
MY FAMILY ALWAYS SAID I COULDN'T POSSIBLY EMAIL OR TALK TO A GUY FIRST THAT I WOULD SEEM TOO AGGRESSIVE
I'M GOING TO CREATE MY OWN MARY POPPINS LIST TO FIND A HUSBAND
SO I'M GOING TO DO THREE THINGS
I WAS ALSO LOOKING AT QUANTITATIVE DATA
IN THE MEANTIME I KEPT SCORING HIM
I WAS TOO AFRAID TO GO OUT THERE AND ASK FOR AND DEMAND WHAT I REALLY WANTED
SO I LOOKED AT THEIR VOCABULARY AND LANGUAGE I LOOKED AT THE LENGTH OF THE PROFILES THEY HAD THEIR SENSES OF HUMOR HOW THEY
SO DO YOU MIND IF I DO
AND I THOUGHT AT THIS POINT AM I GOING TO BE ABLE TO STOP HIM
I HAVEN'T BEEN PICKY ENOUGH
NOW I AM A MODERN WOMAN AND I AM TOTALLY OK WITH PAYING THE BILL SOMETIMES AND SPLITTING THE BILL SOMETIMES
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY TRUE LOVE WILL FIND YOU WHEN YOU'RE LEAST EXPECTING IT
I WAS IN NOT THE BEST RELATIONSHIP ALTHOUGH IT STARTED REALLY WELL AND I THOUGHT THAT THE PERSON I
NOW THE PROBLEM WAS THAT I HAD A VERY FULL SCHEDULE AND THE LAST THING I WANTED TO DO WAS TO SIT
THIS ENTIRE TIME THAT I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO EVERYBODY'S ADVICE
HE WAS STARING PAST ME AND JUST KIND OF LOOKING AT THE GROUND
WHEN WE SPEAK ABOUT SCIENCE WE NEED TO SPEAK IN AN EASY AND SIMPLE ARABIC LANGUAGE
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTION ABOUT ANYTHING GO AND ASK THE SYRIAN RESEARCHERS
AND HOW CAN IT BE DONE
THIS IS AMAZING
ACTUALLY WE NEED THREE THINGS
SO THIS IS A PROBLEM
AND THIS WAS THE SPARKLE OF WHAT I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT TODAY
SO WHAT DO WE NEED
HE'S FEELING PRETTY AWESOME TODAY
IT'S BEEN A REAL PLEASURE TO BE ABLE TO SHARE MY STORY
AND ONE OF THEM IS MOVEMENT AND MIME LIKE I JUST SHOWED YOU
AND THEY WANTED TO TALK TO JAMES ON THEIR FACEBOOK PAGE
MIME AND DRAMA ARE MY FAVORITE ART FORMS
SO CAN WE DO THAT
YOU ARE NOT TOLD ABOUT HOW WE ARE LEARNING TO BEGIN TO WASTE LESS AND CONSUME LESS
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WE WORRY ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE THERE ARE
WE WORRY ABOUT HOW YOU CAN GET AWAY FROM PEOPLE
YOU ARE NOT TOLD ABOUT THE POPULATION SLOWING DOWN
HE ALSO TOLD US
WE'VE ALL BEEN TATTOOED
HE TRAVELED THOUSANDS OF MILES AND MANY DAYS
I'M NOT ASKING YOU FOR HELP I'D LIKE TO HAVE A PARTNERSHIP
PEOPLE ARE PART OF THE PROBLEM BUT PEOPLE ARE THE SOLUTION TO ALL OF THESE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES
I HOPE YOU GET TO KNOW CHIEF ALMIR TODAY YOU WILL FIND HE'S VERY PERSISTENT AND HE IS VERY PERSUASIVE
A SMALL TRIBE
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND
CHIEF ALMIR CAME TO GOOGLE AND HE ASKED US
SO THAT S ONE OF THE WAYS YOU CAN INCREASE YOUR IMAGINATION
AND INVITED THEIR STUDENTS TO PARTICIPATE AT THE SAME TIME
IF YOU CAN IMAGINE IT YOU CAN BUILD IT
AFTER I FINISHED MY PHD I WENT OUT TO STUDY AND SORT OF LEARN ALL ABOUT CREATIVITY IN THE WILD WORKING IN
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO RE FRAME PROBLEMS
REALLY INNOVATIVE FIRMS KNOW THIS WELL
WHAT IF THE SUN IS
AND THE FACT IS WE THEN GET VERY UPSET BECAUSE THE STUDENTS YOU KNOW THEY ARE JUST NOT SO CREATIVE ANYMORE AND EVERYONE
BUT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS
I WANNA TELL YOU A QUICK STORY ABOUT A FRIEND OF MINE BOB SIEGEL WHO IS A PROFESSOR OF HERE STANFORD WHO TAUGHT A
I TOLD THEM THAT I HAD SENT A NOTE OUOT WHICH I DID TO MY COLLEAGUES AROUND THE WORLD
TO RAISE THE BAR EVEN FURTHER I GAVE THEM A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A CHALLENGE
BUT IMAGINATION AND KNOWLEDGE ARE NOT ENOUGH
IT S THE RULES
I SPENT MY ENTIRE GROWING UP WRITING SILENCE IS GOLDEN
IT S UP TO THEM TO TURN IT
BUT I M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO DOES IT
SO WE ARE GETTING REALLY INCREMENTAL SOLUTIONS
WE HAVE TO PAY PEOPLE TO TAKE IT AWAY
IT S THE CONSTRAINTS
BUT THIS IS NOT ENOUGH
BECAUSE MOST JOKES WE TELL ARE INTERESTING BECAUSE THE FRAME SWITCHES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE JOKE
FRAMING AND RE FRAMING PROBLEMS CONNECTING AND COMBINING IDEAS AND CHALLENGING ASSUMPTIONS
BUT UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS NOT ENOUGH
THE QUESTION WHAT IF THE EARTH IS NOT THE CENTER OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM
AND MORE TYPE OF RESOURCES WE HAVE THAT DETERMINE WHAT WE KNOW RIGHT
AND AS A NICE BONUS THESE GUYS ALSO HAVE A MUCH LOWER INCIDENCE OF CANCER AND HEART DISEASE
THAT'S PROBABLY AN UNHEALTHY DOSAGE BUT IT DOES INDICATES THAT COCOA IS A RELATIVELY SAFE
SADLY THESE VERY PROCESSES DESTROY MUCH OF COCOA CURATIVE PROPERTIES AND BECAUSE OF
WELL LET US JUST IMAGINE IF WE CAN REDUCE DISEASE BURDEN ON A GLOBAL SCALE BY JUST 1
NOT A HOLY GRAIL NOT SOME KIND OF BREAKTHROUGH BUT JUST 1
AND ON THE KUNA ISLANDS CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES ARE ALMOST NON EXISTENT
THE ONLY EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE WAS IF YOU WERE A HUMAN SACRIFICE A SACRIFICE TO THE GODS
YOU HAD THE HONOR OF DRINKING YOUR FIRST AND ONLY CUP OF COCOA RIGHT BEFORE THEY KILLED YOU
SO I DID IT AND TO BE HONEST IN THE BEGINNING I WAS SCARED I WAS SCARED OF THE REACTION OF OTHER PEOPLE
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU PLEASE DON'T GIVE UP
THEN YOU ALSO NEED TO DO THAT
AND I KNOW IT CAN BE HARD TO IMAGINE THAT
WELL THIS IS VLOGGING
THEY MET EACH OTHER ONLINE BUT SOME OF THEM ALSO MET EACH OTHER OFFLINE AND MADE FRIENDS
I DO THIS VERY OFTEN
IT'S LIKE HELPING A FRIEND
THEY HELP ME BUT I ALSO HELP THEM
AND I THOUGHT WE ALL HAVE PROBLEMS AND THAT'S OK
AND TODAY I WILL ALSO SHARE MY TEDX EXPERIENCE WITH THEM
I HAVE A LOT OF FOLLOWERS TO BE HONEST
YOU ONLY SEE A NUMBER BUT BEHIND THAT NUMBER THERE ARE PEOPLE WITH REAL FACES REAL FEELINGS AND REAL
IT REALLY DOES
I DON'T QUOTE STATISTICS BECAUSE I THINK THEY'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE
AND I WENT BACK WITH HER TO HER APARTMENT
HE PROGRAMMED MY YOUNG MIND
HOW COULD THAT BE POSSIBLE
THE WORLD IS FACING SO MANY DIFFERENT CONSERVATION CRISES
TAPIRS DO NOT EAT ANTS
AND I TOLD YOU ROADKILL IS A BIG PROBLEM FOR TAPIRS IN THE CERRADO SO WE JUST CAME UP WITH THE IDEA
IN MY MIND THIS MIGHT BE THE BIGGEST LEAPFROG OF THEM ALL
WE CAN PAY THEM OFF OVER A DAILY OR A WEEKLY SCHEDULE
WE NEED TO DO MORE OF THE THINGS WE IN AFRICA WANT TO DO WITH THE APPLIANCE SET
ANOTHER GREAT ONE IS INCREASED CREATIVITY
IT MAY SEEM LIKE 15 20 25 AND THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY A BAD THING
RAPHAEL DON'T MAKE ME COME OVER THERE
AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE A SELF DRIVING CAR
AND YOU MIGHT SAY
WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THERE'S A SHIFT FROM CENTRALIZED BUREAUCRATIC HIERARCHIES
THINK OF THE CAPACITY THAT INDIVIDUALS THAT FAMILIES THE COMMUNITIES HAVE NOW THE POTENTIAL TO WORK
HOW WILL THEY ADOPT THE TECHNOLOGY
THINK OF MEDIA THINK OF THE TELEVISION AND THE NEWS SERVICES THAT WE EXPECT
NOW BOB IS A VERY HARDWORKING INDIVIDUAL
THEY CAME UP WITH A BIG RECORD WHICH WOULD SAY EXACTLY WHO OWNED WHAT WHICH THEY KEPT BEHIND
THERE'S A LOT OF POWER INVOLVED AND PEOPLE ARE UNDERSTANDABLY ATTACHED TO MONEY IT'S ONE OF MAN'S
AND SO AS AN ATHLETE YOU'RE LEFT ASKING YOURSELF WHAT DO I NEED TO DO TO BE SUCCESSFUL BOTH ATHLETICALLY
SPORT IS A COMPETITIVE REWARD STRUCTURE
IT GETS MOST OF ITS ENERGY FROM THE SUN
AND THE THIRD THING IS IT ONLY OPENS THEN CLOSES THE TRAPS A HANDFUL OF TIMES UNTIL THAT TRAP
OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM EVOLVED BECAUSE IT IS ELECTRICAL
IT'S JUST TRYING TO REPLACE SOME NUTRIENTS IN THE GROUND WITH FLIES
YOU LEARNED THAT PLANTS COULD BE USED TO HELP TEACH NEUROSCIENCE AND BRING ALONG THE NEUROREVOLUTION
YOU KNOW THAT DOESN'T COUNT
THE COOLEST THING IS THAT THE PLANT CAN COUNT
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY COULD BE THAT IT SCARES AWAY INSECTS OR IT LOOKS LESS APPEALING TO HERBIVORES
IT'S OKAY TO GO BACK THERE AS LONG AS YOU DON'T GET STUCK THERE
BUT DON'T GET ME WRONG THERE'S A LOT ABOUT BEING 13 THAT I DO NOT MISS
AND I'M SURE WE'VE ALL FELT MOMENTS LIKE THAT
SO WHY ALL THE NEGATIVE CONNOTATION WITH NOSTALGIA
NOW AS NEWLY FOUND PHILOSOPHERS I ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE ACTIONS REQUIRED OR THE TWO
WHAT ARE THE MANY NUANCES OF PHILOSOPHY THAT PEOPLE THINK AND EXPERIENCE
THAT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE DELIBERATION TAKES A LITTLE TIME
THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A CATCH
SOME OF YOU PROBABLY HAVE HEARD ABOUT IT BEFORE
NOW THE QUESTION FOR YOU IS
AND THIS MAKES YOU PHILOSOPHERS
AND WE DON'T KNOW ACTUALLY WHICH PART OF THE BRAIN IS ENGAGED IN PROCESSING TIME
VERY NATURALLY THOUGH
SO WITHOUT COUNTING WITHOUT LOOKING AT YOUR WATCH
THERE ARE SO MANY POSSIBLE APPLICATIONS FOR THIS
ARE YOU READY FOR THIS
NOW IT'S NOT THAT THESE THINGS ARE INHERENTLY UNSEEABLE
EVERYTHING IS ABOUT SMELL FOR YOU
SO I CALL THIS THE P
THE LAST CHAPTER IN ANY SUCCESSFUL GENOCIDE IS THE ONE IN WHICH THE OPPRESSOR CAN
THEY ARE OFTEN HUNGRY
IN MOLDOVA DESPITE EXTREME POVERTY AND THE TERRIBLE EFFECTS OF THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS
YET I COULD SEE SOILED NAPPIES AND I COULD SEE THAT SOME OF THE CHILDREN WERE DISTRESSED BUT THE ONLY NOISE WAS A LOW
AND INSTEAD OF BEING PROVIDED WITH POSITIVE MESSAGES ABOUT THEIR CHILD'S POTENTIAL ARE TOLD BY THE DOCTORS
AWARENESS RAISING IS REQUIRED AT EVERY LEVEL OF SOCIETY
THE NEWLY ADMITTED BABIES WOULD CRY FOR THE FIRST FEW HOURS BUT THEIR DEMANDS WERE NOT MET AND SO EVENTUALLY THEY LEARNED NOT
IT IS THE MODEL FOR ALL FUTURE RELATIONSHIPS WITH FRIENDS WITH PARTNERS AND WITH THEIR OWN
AND IT'S ONLY WHEN IT GOES WRONG THAT WE START TO REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF FAMILIES TO CHILDREN
IN AUGUST 1993 I HAD MY FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO WITNESS ON A MASSIVE SCALE
AND ALIGN YOURSELF TO LOVE
ALREADY AT THE VERY EARLY STAGE OF FACE PROCESSING A SOCIAL CATEGORIZATION HAPPENS
AND WHEN I SAY IT IS AN EVALUATION MIGHT IT NOT BE THAT EMOTIONS PLAY A ROLE IN THIS
REMEMBER WHAT CLAYTON CHRISTENSEN POINTED OUT IN HIS BRILLIANT BOOK THE INNOVATOR'S DILEMMA WHEN YOU START
LEADERSHIP IS EXHAUSTING
WHAT IF WE PUT EMPLOYEES INTO THOSE MARKETS NOT TO SELL ANYTHING RIGHT AWAY PER
THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ALL DAY HERE TODAY
WE'VE GOTTEN SOME REALLY GREAT IDEAS ON HOW WE MIGHT DO THAT
I COMPARTMENTALIZED AND I STUFFED MY EMOTIONS BACK INTO THAT MESSY BOX
THE BRAND OF TRAUMA I EXPERIENCED WAS SEXUAL ABUSE AT THE HANDS OF MY STEPFATHER
WHY DID I FEEL LIKE I HAVE DONE SOMETHING WRONG
BUT THAT'S JUST THE FRONT FACING PART OF MY STORY
AFTER THE BREAKUP I NEEDED THAT SAME SENSE OF CONTROL AGAIN SO I DID WHAT CAME NATURALLY
AND THEN THERE WAS MY OTHER STUFF
IT WAS ALMOST LIKE MY PAST BECAME PROLOGUE AND SLOWLY CHANGED WHAT I HAD COME TO
AND OF COURSE IT ALL COMES BACK TO A BOY
UNTIL RECENTLY SLEEP PROBLEMS THAT OCCURRED IN THE CONTEXT OF MAJOR LIFE STRESS OR MEDICAL OR
WELL THE EVIDENCE IS IN AND THE RESULTS ARE CLEAR
CAN YOU MAYBE THINK BACK TO WHEN THAT WAS
AND HE DREAMT OF BEING ABLE TO TRAVEL THE 48
AND HE SAID
I WISH I COULD FLY THERE
I WISH I COULD FLY
YOU ASK PEOPLE TO TRY TO EXPLAIN
ONCE THEY REALIZE THAT THEIR LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE IS NOT JUSTIFIED BY THEIR KNOWLEDGE THEY MODERATE THEIR
WHEN YOU SEE A CLOUD FROM A DISTANCE WHAT DO YOU SEE
WE THINK WE'RE RIGHT
EXPLAIN HOW A TOILET WORKS
NO I'M SORRY NOT EXPLAIN IT BUT PROVIDE REASONS FOR IT
WHAT I WOULD IMPLORE YOU TO DO THOUGH IS TO THINK ABOUT IT THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND
WE TEND TO TAKE THESE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT POLICY ISSUES AND WE SEE THEM
I PURPOSELY PICKED THIS EXAMPLE BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S PROBABLY PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO HAVE VERY STRONG OPINIONS ABOUT GMO IT'S A HOT
MAYBE YOU'RE FOR MAYBE YOU'RE AGAINST IT
DON'T THINK TOO HARD ABOUT IT JUST THINK ABOUT WHAT YOUR SENSE IS OKAY
THAT'S THE QUESTION I'VE BEEN STUDYING IN MY LAB
OUR LEADERS ARE INCREDIBLY PASSIONATE ABOUT THEIR POSITIONS AND SO ARE WE
WHAT MAKES US SO PASSIONATE ABOUT OUR POSITIONS
THIS RULE WAS OBVIOUSLY IN PLACE TO PROTECT OTHER TRUCKERS FROM COMPETITION WHICH OF COURSE WAS THE WHOLE
SO HE PERSUADES HAL VARIAN TO LEAVE HIS TENURED POSITION AT BERKELEY AND JOIN GOOGLE AS
BUT THEY ALSO OPPOSED IT FOR ANOTHER REASON
NOW OUR GUY I'M GOING TO CALL HIM THE ANTI HERO
THEY WENT ON TO DEVELOP A HIGHLY FLEXIBLE AND EFFICIENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM THAT WAS
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR MY STORY IS THAT DEREGULATION UNLEASHED VIGOROUS COMPETITION
THEY'RE NOT NATURAL MONOPOLIES IN THE SAME WAY THAT A LOCAL UTILITY IS THAT NEEDS REGULATION IN
NO AIRLINES AND TRUCKS SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN REGULATED
IT'S A 300 BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY IN THE UNITED STATES ALONE
I WANT TO TRY TO SHOW TO YOU HOW ECONOMISTS AND THEIR IDEAS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE RISE OF THE
THE REAL KEY IS THEY MAKE YOU THIS PROPOSITION
BUT THE CEO OF GOOGLE AT THE TIME ERIC SCHMIDT STILL WASN'T SOLD ON THE SECOND PRICE AUCTION AS THE WAY TO
BUT WHAT IF I'VE GOT A PIECE OF LAND AND I JUST WANT TO BURY A FEW PEOPLE LIKE FIVE OR SIX
AND YOU KNOW TO A CERTAIN EXTENT THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE TAKING CARE OF THINGS FOR US
BUT THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT FOR FORMAL REQUIREMENTS
BUT THEY'LL ALSO THINK ABOUT THINGS LIKE WHAT IMPACT IS IT GOING TO HAVE ON THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT
THEY ALSO TELL YOU THAT YOU NEED TO KEEP A RECORD OF WHERE THE GRAVE IS
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO OUR CITIES AND THINKING ABOUT HOW DEATH FITS IN OUR CITIES THERE'S MUCH LESS
AND THE REASONS THAT PEOPLE GIVE
THAT NO ONE WILL WANT TO BUY YOUR HOUSE AT ALL AFTER THAT
SO WE'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT THIS BUT ALL OF THE PEOPLE WE IMAGINE ARE THINKING ABOUT IT THEY'RE NOT TAKING
THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALL THIS REGULATION AND BUREAUCRACY AROUND THINGS LIKE BURYING A DEATH FOR EXAMPLE
I'M AN ARCHITECT AND URBAN DESIGNER AND FOR THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT APPROACHES TO DEATH AND
AND THEY'LL WEIGH UP THE ADVANTAGES AND THE DISADVANTAGES AND THEY'LL MAKE A DECISION
SO ABOUT HALF A MILLION PEOPLE DIE IN THE UK EACH YEAR AND OF THOSE AROUND A QUARTER
IN FACT THE SURPRISING THING IS THAT THERE'S NO LEGAL OBLIGATION ON ANYONE IN THE UK TO PROVIDE
BUT ANYWAY THE COUNCIL GRANTED THESE PEOPLE PERMISSION AND THEY'RE NOW TRYING TO BUILD THEIR CEMETERY
I REALLY LOVE MY JOB I LOVE MY RESEARCH AND I JUST WANT TO KEEP DOING IT
WHAT YOU SEE BEHIND YOU IS A SAMPLE FROM A METASTATIC BREAST CANCER PATIENT AND WE'RE
AND SO THIS WAS SORT OF THE PROCESS
BECAUSE IT ADDS EXTRA STEPS INTO THIS PATH
IN CLOSING I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT LIFE IS NOT FAIR
AGAIN MY BACKGROUND IS MOSTLY NEURO SO I WORK A LOT WITH THE BRAIN CANCER DOCS
SO THAT COULD EASILY PROVIDE ME A LIFETIME OF WORK
WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE ALL OF THIS AND CERTAINLY NOT IN A CLINICAL SETTING
THEN I MIGHT MOVE TO A PATIENT SAMPLE
HONESTLY I COULDN'T REMEMBER WHAT HE SAID BUT ONE OF THE WORDS HE MENTIONED GRABBED MY ATTENTION AND THAT WORD WAS
WHICH CLASS DID I BELONG TO THEN
BUT JUST AS THE INTERNET HAS OPENED UP THE WORLD FOR EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US IT HAS ALSO OPENED UP EACH AND EVERY ONE OF
AND I HAD TO VISUALIZE THE SWIM
AND SO WHAT HAD ACTUALLY HAPPENED IS THAT THE CELLS IN MY FINGERS HAD FROZEN AND EXPANDED
WE'VE COME A LONG WAY
AND SO I LITERALLY SWAM ACROSS THE NORTH POLE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF TIMES IN MY MIND
THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT SWIM
AND I REALIZE THE REASON WHY YOU'RE GOING TO DO THIS
AND THE WATER AT THE NORTH POLE IS MINUS 1
I'VE SEEN THE WAY YOU'VE BEEN TRAINING
I HAD TO TASTE THE SALT WATER IN MY MOUTH
A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO HE TRIED TO SKI ALL THE WAY TO THE NORTH POLE
I WAS HYPERVENTILATING SO MUCH AND WITHIN SECONDS MY HANDS WERE NUMB
I WAS GASPING FOR AIR
WE ARE GOING TO ACTUALLY HAVE TO TAKE THEM OFF
AT THE VERY BEST I'M GOING TO END UP LOSING SOME FINGERS
I SO BELIEVE IN YOU LEWIS
AND THIS DREAM WHICH I HAD HAD EVER SINCE I WAS A YOUNG BOY WITH MY FATHER WAS JUST GOING OUT THE
SO WE STOPPED THE SHIP AS YOU DO
I COULD BARELY BREATHE
WE CARRIED ON SAILING THROUGH THE ICE PACKS TOWARDS THE NORTH POLE
BUT WAS IT WORTH IT
BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WAS TO TRAIN MY MIND TO PREPARE MYSELF FOR WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN
HE ALSO TOLD ME ABOUT THE GREAT EXPLORERS
THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THAT PLACE WHICH DREW ME TO IT
AND PERHAPS THE BEST PLACE TO START IS WITH MY LATE FATHER
I HAD NEVER SEEN BLACK WATER BEFORE
WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT
I WENT TO SOUTHERN AFRICA
GREAT GOOGLE AWAY
AND IT WORKED TOO
WE AGREE ON A GLOBAL SCALE WHAT THE ANSWERS ARE TO THESE ISOLATED FACTS
THE HUMANITIES AND THE TECHNOLOGY
AM I LOOKING FOR AN ISOLATED FACT
YOU DON'T SEE A BIG CONSPIRACY AMONG THOSE THINGS
AND IF THERE WAS SOMEBODY WHO IMMEDIATELY UNDERSTOOD THIS IT WAS A SWEDISH WEB DEVELOPER A SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION EXPERT
THERE WAS A PICTURE DISTRIBUTED WIDELY OVER THE INTERNET WHERE HER FACE WAS DISTORTED TO LOOK LIKE A MONKEY
STRANGELY ENOUGH I ALWAYS GET THE SAME THREE ANSWERS
AND IF NOTHING ELSE TO REMIND US THAT THAT WONDERFULLY SEDUCTIVE IDEA OF THE UNBIASED CLEAN SEARCH RESULT
AND MY MESSAGE GOES OUT NOT ONLY TO GOOGLE BUT TO ALL BELIEVERS IN THE FAITH OF CODE AROUND THE WORLD
AND HE PREPARED ALL THREE STEPS EQUALLY WELL
AND I WILL SAY YES THIS IS TRUE BUT THIS IS MORE IMPORTANT TO ME THAN THAT
THIS IS WHEN WE START TO ARGUE TO FORM SOCIETY
YOU'RE RIGHT YOU'RE WRONG
WHAT IS THE CAPITAL OF FRANCE
I WILL SHOW YOU WHY THAT PHILOSOPHICALLY IS ALMOST AN IMPOSSIBILITY
BUT LET ME FIRST ELABORATE JUST A LITTLE BIT ON A BASIC PRINCIPLE BEHIND EACH SEARCH QUERY THAT WE SOMETIMES SEEM TO
SO WHENEVER YOU SET OUT TO GOOGLE SOMETHING START BY ASKING YOURSELF THIS
WE BELIEVE IN YOU WE DON'T BELIEVE IN YOU
I AM DRIVEN TO PROVIDE THOSE SAME KINDS OF OPPORTUNITIES
SOMETIMES IT HAS FELT LIKE BEATING MY HEAD AGAINST THE WALL
SO I CREATED A COURSE IN EDUCATIONAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP
GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY
OUR FACULTY DESIGN CUTTING EDGE CURRICULUM
BY DESIGN THESE SCHOOLS ATTRACT FAMILIES FROM ACROSS THE
THEY'RE SEPARATED BY DISTANCES THAT ARE AROUND THE SIZE OF A BIOMOLECULE
AND THIS IS WHERE WE'RE REALLY LUCKY
WE KNEW HOW TO BUILD ROCKETS
BUCKLE YOUR SEAT BELT UP IN YOUR CAR
IT WAS A PLEASURE IT WAS AN HONOUR TO BE SOMEONE WHO COULD PROVIDE LAUGHTER
LIFE'S A CRAPSHOOT MAN
THEY UNDERSTAND THE DEEPNESS OF LOVE
I LOST MY JOY
SOME OF US SAY IT BUT WE DON'T MEAN IT
THE WONDERFUL THING ABOUT ALL OF US IS AS WE GROW AND WE BEGIN TO EXPERIENCE LIFE
TO BE SURE GOVERNMENTS HAVE DIFFERENT RESOURCES TO BRING TO THE TABLE
THEY WERE FRUSTRATED AND THEY HAD ACHIEVED MUCH LESS THAN WHAT THEY HAD HOPED FOR
AND LIKE ALL SUCH STORIES THIS IS NOT A STORY JUST OF TECHNOLOGY
ONE FRUSTRATED JOURNALIST COULD NOT TAKE THIS ANYMORE
HE PURCHASED HIS OWN PLANE TICKET AND WENT TO THE VILLAGE WHERE THIS HAD OCCURRED
EDITORS SAT IN THEIR NEWSROOMS AND WAITED FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO TELL THEM WHAT TO DO
SO HOW DO WE DO THIS
AND THE MUCK
SO WHY IS IT
I TURN TO THAT CORNER OF THE ARENA AND I THRUST MY FIST IN THE AIR IN VICTORY
SIMPLY BY MAKING A MOMENT
BUT HERE'S HOW YOU CAN DO IT TOO
YOU KNOW WHEN EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT INSIGHT ILLUMINATION INSPIRATION
BUT WHAT INDEED IS THE ENVIRONMENT HERE
ANYWAY IN ALL THESE EXAMPLES THE COMPUTER CAN ONLY EMULATE HUMAN DEFINED
I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHY ALL THOSE WORDS BEGIN WITH AN I
AND OF COURSE ARTISTS INFLUENCE AND CHANGE THE ENVIRONMENT
OUR CENTURY WILL MOST PROBABLY BE THE AGE OF BIOLOGY
BUT THEY ARE VERY GOOD AS STARTING POINTS FOR FURTHER SEARCHING
HI MY NAME IS DAVID
BUT WE'RE FACING A STARK DILEMMA WHERE SOME CITIES ARE GOING TO THRIVE AND DRIVE GLOBAL GROWTH
WE'VE GOT TO GET AWAY FROM THIS MODEL OF SEGREGATION EXCLUSION AND CITIES WITH WALLS
IN OTHER WORDS 10 TIMES MORE PEOPLE ARE DYING OUTSIDE OF WAR THAN INSIDE WAR
TOKYO WITH 35 MILLION PEOPLE IS ONE OF THE LARGEST AND SOME MIGHT SAY SAFEST URBAN
IF YOU LIVE IN RIO I'M SORRY SHAVE OFF TWO RIGHT THERE
DO YOU KNOW WHERE IT'S THREE PER 100000
WELL GUESS WHAT
IF WE CONTINUE TO PILE UPON OURSELVES IN CITIES AS THEY DO IN EUROPE WE SHALL BECOME AS CORRUPT AS THEY ARE IN EUROPE AND TAKE TO
YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF IT
AND YOU SEE THIS ALIGNMENT THIS STRANGE ALIGNMENT
IT'S JAPAN IT'S FOUR PER 100000
THESE CHANGES AND OTHERS LIKE THEM CHANGED THE WAY THAT PORTLANDERS LIVE AND THEIR VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED PER DAY THE
AND I LEARNED A NEW WORD LAST WEEK
AND WE TAKE CAR CRASHES FOR GRANTED
PEOPLE WITH CF CAN'T ACTUALLY BE IN THE SAME ROOM TOGETHER
SOMETHING THAT WOULD GENUINELY HELP THEM THROUGH THEIR EXPERIENCE
I WAS DESPERATELY LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO GRAB ONTO
SO PARENTS OF CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS END UP HAVING TO TAKE OFF LONG PERIODS OF WORK TO BE ABLE TO
I JUST EAT LITERALLY LIKE A VAT OF BROWN RICE AND POTATOES AND LIKE MORE BREAD ON
LIFE ISN'T ABOUT JUST TRYING TO BE HAPPY
BUT WHEN I DID COME OUT OF IT I REALIZED THAT KIND OF SUPPORT DOESN'T EXIST FOR OTHER PEOPLE WITH CF
MAYBE I CAN'T CONTRIBUTE SOMETHING INTO THE WORLD BECAUSE I GENUINELY LIKE AM NOT
SO HOW EVERY SINGLE ATOM THAT MAKES UP YOU AND ME WAS FORMED IN THE BELLY OF A SUN
IS THERE A WAY WE CAN COLLABORATE
THERE'S SOME BIG CHALLENGES AHEAD
OCEANEERING ARE NOW EQUIPPING SOME OF THEIR ROVS WITH 3D CAMERAS AND WHEN THEY AIM THOSE CAMERAS AT DEEP
HE TALKED ABOUT THE GLORIES OF FAILURE
WELL WE HAD A LOT OF THEM
IT STOPPED MOVING
EVEREST AND THEY CAN SIT THERE FOR HOURS AND THERE'S NO PROBLEM
IN FACT SO LOW THAT PHYSICIANS WILL NOT HAVE TO LOWER OR DIM THE METABOLISM OF PEOPLE MUCH AT ALL TO SEE THE BENEFIT I
ITS OXYGEN CONSUMPTION RATE FELL BY TENFOLD
SO THEN THERE'S ALSO MY FAVORITE EXAMPLE OF SUSPENDED ANIMATION
AND THAT IS THAT WHEN WE LOWER THE OXYGEN CONCENTRATION FURTHER BY 100 TIMES TO 10 PARTS PER
THE RESEARCHERS HAD TO SUIT UP JUST TO ENTER IT
BUT YOU JUST HAVEN'T FOUND IT YET
ACTUALLY HOW MANY STUDENTS DO WE HAVE IN HERE
HIGH SCHOOLERS WOULD BE GRADUATING WITH SO MUCH PASSION THEY WOULD KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO GET
LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU MY 50 50 RULE
BUT NO IT'S NOT RADIO
IT HAS TO HAPPEN IN CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH BIOLOGISTS
I THINK WE CAN RECONSIDER THAT CHOICE
IT COULD ALSO BE USED AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL WHERE ONE OF THE GREAT CHALLENGES WE FACE IS TO PERSUADE LOCAL
IN THEORY REFUGEES HAVE A RIGHT TO A PATHWAY TO INTEGRATION OR RETURN TO THE COUNTRY THEY'VE COME
KING ABDULLAH HAS PICKED UP ON THE IDEA
WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN EUROPE WILL BE WITH US FOR MANY YEARS
IT GIVES THEM FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT
IF WE ALLOWED REFUGEES TO DO THAT IT WOULD HAVE MAJOR ADVANTAGES
IT GIVES THEM THE RIGHT TO WORK
EDUCATION IS OFTEN OF POOR QUALITY
FIRST WHY IS THE CURRENT SYSTEM NOT WORKING
BUT TODAY THAT SYSTEM IS FAILING
IN THEORY REFUGEES HAVE A RIGHT TO SEEK ASYLUM
NOT TO BE SLIPPED INTO NOW AND AGAIN
AND THEN FLUNK THEM TO THE SIDE SOMEWHERE
AND BY THE WAY WHO IN HIS RIGHT MIND WOULD ARGUE AGAINST LOVE OF LEARNING
MOST RECENT STUDIES WOULD TELL YOU THAT MEDIA STEREOTYPES SURROUNDING BLACK QUARTERBACKS BEING
IS THAT COOL
I TURNED TOWARDS THE CONTROL THAT ANOREXIA THAT ED WAS GIVING ME
WE DEALT WITH OUR ANXIETIES IN VERY SIMILAR WAYS
I COULD CHOOSE TO LET MY ED TAKE OVER TO HAVE MY BRAIN TELL ME TO STARVE TO RUN WHEN I WASN'T ALLOWED TO
THIS WILL GIVE ME SUCCESS IN THE POOL
IT'S THIS ODD PUZZLE EATING DISORDER ARE IN THAT FROM THE INSIDE LOOKING OUT YOU LONG FOR
I TOOK A SEMESTER OFF OF SCHOOL IN 2013
I ADMITTED THIS WAS MY LIFE
I ADMITTED I HAD A PROBLEM
FEELINGS AND EMOTIONS FLED BACK IN AND I HAD A CHOICE
NOT AT FIRST OF COURSE BUT AFTER MY RESIDENTIAL STAY AND GOING TO LIVE WITH MY DAD FOR A WHILE I LEARNED MORE AND
BUT YOU HAVE ITS VOICE SCREAMING IN YOUR HEAD THAT YOU'RE FAT THAT YOU'RE WORTHLESS YOU
NO LONGER DID I CARE ABOUT MY HIPS MY SWIMMING ACADEMICS MY FRIENDS MY HEALTH
I REFUSED TO FACE WHAT WAS BEING DEALT TO ME
ONE OF MY ROLE MODELS AND SOURCE OF INSPIRATION BREN BROWN ONCE STATED THOSE WORDS
PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS PILED ON ANXIETY CREPT IN
HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO SEE MYSELF THIS IMAGE OF A LEADER OF A SUCCESSFUL AND WORTHY PERSON IF I COULD NOT
SO WE ALREADY HAVE CAMERAS
YOU HEAR ABOUT PEOPLE WITH GOOGLE GLASS BEING ATTACKED
WE HAVE TWO CHOICES THEN
THERE IS NUMBER ONE
THERE'S TOO MUCH PREPARATION
ARE YOU GOING TO BECOME A SUPERSTAR
AND SO FOR MUSICIANS WHAT DO WE HAVE
BUT KNOW THAT REVENGE IS AGAINST YOURSELF
IF WE TOOK ALL THE ENERGY WE SPENT ON WAGING WAR AND PUT IT INTO SOLVING OUR DISPUTES INSTEAD OF MAKING MORE THEN MAYBE WE COULD FIX THE PROBLEMS
AND RONNIE DOUGLAS SAID THE SAME THING
YOU KNOW TRAFFIC LIGHTS
MY DAD TOLD ME THIS YEARS AGO
BOTH BIG AND MEANINGFUL AND WE NEED THOSE INITIATIVES
AT THE TIME THAT THIS CROP WAS BEING
ORG THANK YOU
THEY'LL PROBABLY BE JUST SHORT OF THAT
IT IS A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
BUT GUESS WHAT
IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HTML 5 IS LET ME HELP YOU UNDERSTAND
BECAUSE IT ESSENTIALLY OPENS UP A NEW CANVAS
BECAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO CONSTRUCT A WEB PAGE WHERE THE ENTIRE
WE HAVE PHOTOGRAPHERS WHO WORK EVERY SHOW WE HAVE PAINTERS AND THE NOTION IS I BELIEVE THAT
AND THE SIMPLEST WAY TO LOOK AT IS LOOK AT THE GOOGLE RESULTS PAGE
BUT I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THIS GROUP OF HYPOTHESES NOW FOR ABOUT 10 MONTHS AND WHAT'S REALLY
AND I'M SUGGESTING WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A JUMP OFF OF THEIR REVENUE
AND IN A WORLD WHERE THE U
THEY ARE ALL ALWAYS PUBLIC HAVE PUBLIC ACCESS AND HAVE GOOD PEDESTRIAN INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT
BUT FOR A CITY TO GROW IN THE RIGHT PLACE IT IS NECESSARY FOR GOVERNMENTS TO BE ABLE TO DECIDE
I DO NOT THINK SO
INSIDE THE MALL ONE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S DAY OR NIGHT
THE HIGH INCOME PERSON GOES TO A LARGE HOME WITH ACCESS TO GARDENS WITH ACCESS TO VACATIONS
AND THAT ENCOURAGEMENT LED ME TO SHARE THOSE DUETS WITH MY CLASSMATES AND THEY ENCOURAGED
I DO IT WHEN I PLAY OBVIOUSLY
I'M NOT REALLY THINKING ABOUT COMPOSITION I'M ONLY THINKING ABOUT ARRANGING
I NEED THAT DATA IN NOVEMBER
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THE WAY THE WORLD WORKS
AND WE'VE GOT TO DO BETTER
YOU'D BETTER STAY IN SCHOOL
I NEED THAT DATA IN SEPTEMBER
BUT WE KNOW THIS IS CRITICAL
GO FIND ANOTHER BANK
A HUNDRED PERCENT OF THEM WENT TO COLLEGE
PLEASE REMEMBER THE TIME WHEN YOU WERE PLAYING HIDE AND SEEK WITH YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND YOU WERE
THIRD WITH THE RIGHT USE OF SHARED TECHNOLOGIES AND AN OPEN
43000 SQUARE FEET THAT'S AN ACRE
I WAS CAPTIVATED
THEY DRINK WATER MIXED WITH INORGANIC EARTH MINERAL MOLECULES
IF WE CAN THINK DIFFERENT
SELLING PRODUCE TO SOME OF THE FINEST RESTAURANTS IN TOWN
AFTER A YEAR OF PRODUCTION THEY'RE SOLD OUT
THEY HARVEST LETTUCE EVERY 28 DAYS
THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS ORGANIC PERRIER YOU KNOW
CHINA BIGGEST IN THE WORLD 2
WE USED TO BE A NET EXPORTER OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AND WE ARE NOW A NET IMPORTER OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES
STATES CITIES AND COMMUNITIES NEED TO START THINKING LIKE THESE PROGRESSIVE COUNTRIES AROUND GREENHOUSE FARMING
HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE USED AN ELECTRONIC SPREADSHEET LIKE MICROSOFT EXCEL
I TRIED THAT
RESTRICTING YOU TO A GRID HELPED SOLVE MY PROBLEM
SOME OF US ARE DOING VERY WELL
MY NAME IS SARAH AND EVERYTHING PERTAINING TO THAT JOKE RELATES TO ME
I REALLY DO HAVE A 4
B REPLIES WE'RE ONLY ON THE SECOND FLOOR
IT S NOT A LIE
IF YOU STRIP THE WORD NEW OUT OF IT THE QUESTION THAT COMES TO ME
NO OF COURSE IT'S A LIE
I WANT TO BE THE LION
NOW I TELL YOU WHEN YOU GROW UP IN ISRAEL THESE STORIES THEY'RE NOT ONLY WORDS ON A
MY BROTHER WAS ALWAYS THERE FOR ME WHEN I NEEDED HIM
AND SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND SHE LED US INTO THE LIVING ROOM AND THERE ON A SOFA IN
WHY ARE YOU STOPPING NOW
ARE YOU BE INTERESTED IN ANY OF THAT
IF YOU HAVE A PAPERCLIP TRADE IT AWAY
I REALLY WANTED TO TRADE WITH HIM
HALF OF IT'S UNRENTED
I SAY ALRIGHT IF YOU CAN GET IT THAT'D BE GREAT
HE'S WELL WE NEED TOWN COUNCIL APPROVAL
I WAS INTRIGUED JUST BY THE IDEA OF SOMEBODY'S WORST SNOWMOBILE
WE'RE IMPROVING EACH OTHER'S LIVES ALBEIT ON A SMALL SCALE
BUT BEFORE I GET STARTED ON THAT STORY I WANT TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THIS SLIDE BEHIND ME
AND WE MET UP ONE NIGHT
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN
I'LL TRADE YOU MY WORST SNOWMOBILE
WHAT DO YOU HAVE
TURNS OUT TOWN COUNCIL APPROVAL WAS GETTING TWO PEOPLE TO PUT THEIR HAND IN THE AIR
MARK SAYS I'M AN AMATEUR PHOTOGRAPHER WITH A LOT OF KISS MEMORABILIA
HIS TOUR MANAGER CALLED ME UP AND SAYS WE'RE ON TOUR IN FARGO NORTH DAKOTA
HE'LL PROBABLY HAVE SEVERAL MANSIONS
HE'D EASILY TRADE YOU ONE OF THEM
LET'S CALL HIM MIKE
WE STARTED BY TALKING TO COLLEGE SURVIVORS
IT CHANGES THE WAY YOU FRAME YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE IT CHANGES THE WAY YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR PERPETRATOR IT MEANS THAT IF
BUT WHEN SHE SEES MIKE TAKING GIRLS HOME FROM PARTIES SHE'S WORRIED ABOUT THEM
SO THIS TO ME IS A TRAGIC BUT A SOLVABLE PROBLEM
AND SO WE DID
SO WE SEE THAT DEFINING REALITY IS NOT SO EASY
AND WHAT ABOUT OUR SKY
BUT WITHOUT ACKNOWLEDGING THE PHENOMENON NOT EVEN THIS FIRST STEP SCIENTISTS
NOW AS ANTHROPOLOGISTS WE KNOW THAT EVERY CULTURE HAS AN ORIGIN STORY
THAT'S A THIRD SIDE ACT
WHAT DO I KNOW ABOUT PUERTO RICO
HIS BASIC MESSAGE WAS UNITY TOO THE INTERCONNECTEDNESS OF IT ALL THE UNITY OF IT ALL
THE PATH RIGHT NOW IS LIKE AN ACORN IT'S STILL IN ITS EARLY PHASE
WE'RE ABOUT TO TAKE A BREAK IN A MOMENT
AND SO SHE TOLD OUR TEAM THERE SHE SAID YOU HAVE MADE ME VISIBLE
WHAT WOULD THE OAK TREE LOOK LIKE
THAT'S WALKING ABRAHAM'S PATH
WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN
WHAT IS THE STORY THERE
SO THEN THEY HAD 18 CAMELS
THE FIRST SON TOOK HIS HALF HALF OF 18 IS NINE
THAT'S THE QUESTION
AND I THINK I'VE FOUND IN SOME WAYS WHAT IS THE SECRET TO PEACE
RELIGIOUS TEACHING MUST ALWAYS LEAD TO ACTION
THE SAME APPLIES TO EDUCATORS
AND WE NEED TO REVIVE THAT SPIRIT
I WANT THEM TO GET THE MEDIA INVOLVED BECAUSE THE MEDIA ARE CRUCIAL IN HELPING TO
BUT HE WROTE ONE THING THAT STUCK IN MY MIND EVER SINCE I READ IT WHEN I WAS A SCHOOLGIRL
BECAUSE WE CAN CHANGE THE WORLD WE HAVE THE ABILITY
IT'S IN HIS BOOK THE FOUR LOVES
IT CAN'T STOP WITH THE LAUNCH
BECAUSE WITH A FEW WONDERFUL EXCEPTIONS VERY OFTEN WHEN RELIGIOUS PEOPLE COME TOGETHER RELIGIOUS
NOW WHY WAS I SO GRATEFUL TO TED
THIS IS THE SOURCE OF ALL MORALITY THIS IMAGINATIVE ACT OF EMPATHY PUTTING
HE TOLD ME HE WOULDN'T LEAVE THE FIELDS UNLESS HIS PARENTS CAME WITH HIM
THAT I WOULD LET PEOPLE LIKE YOU HEAR HER STORY AND SO THIS MORNING I'M GOING TO HONOR THAT PROMISE AND I'M GOING TO
SO TO GET THE SAME AMOUNT OF PRODUCT YOU HAVE TO CONFINE A WHOLE LOT MORE OF THEM AND KILL AND HARM A LOT MORE OF THEM
AND SUPPOSE THAT YOU MET A VETERINARIAN OR FOUND OUT ABOUT ONE THAT WAS TREATING DOGS OR CATS IN ANY ONE OF THESE
SO THIS IS CERTAINLY A PARTIAL LIST
NOW 95 OF THE LAND ANIMALS RAISED FOR FOOD IN THE UNITED STATES ARE
KEEP IN MIND THESE ARE ORGANISMS WHO ARE MUCH SMALLER
I RECENTLY FINISHED MY PH
IN THE DEPTHS OF MY STUDIES OF PHILOSOPHY I LEARNED A SIMPLE TRUTH ABOUT JUSTICE AND SOME POWERFUL MIND
IT'S AN ONGOING FIGHT
AND IN DOING SO WE CAN SUDDENLY FOLD ANYTHING
I CHOSE TO DESIGN A COLUMN
WOULD THEY SURPRISE US
WHATEVER IT IS THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU WANTED TO DO AS A KID
I MEAN IT IS EXPENSIVE AND IT IS FULL OF NASTY CHEMICALS
MOST OF US COULDN'T
YOU MIGHT AS WELL THINK ABOUT THINGS YOU WANTED TO DO AS A KID AND THINK RIGHT I CAN DO THAT NOW
AND THERE WILL BE BACKLASH THERE ALWAYS IS
MY NAME IS TRACEY SPICER AND I'M NO LONGER A VAIN FOOL
AND YET EVERY TIME I GO OUT WITHOUT MAKE UP THE COMMENTS ARE ALWAYS THE SAME
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M GOING TO GUIDE THE COMPUTER WHILE IT PLAYS IN CERTAIN RHYTHMS BUT IT'S GOING TO CREATE THE NOTES AND THE HARMONIES ITSELF
BEHAVIORAL IS SUBCONSCIOUS YOU'RE UNAWARE OF IT
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
THE BRAIN WORKS DIFFERENTLY IF YOU'RE HAPPY
OR WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT
SO THAT'S THE NEW ME
WE DISLIKE SCOLDING VOICES
IT'S BEAUTIFUL AND IT'S FUNCTIONAL
WE DO IT ANYWAY
THERE ARE A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH THIS QUESTION
WHO CARES IF THE BAKE SALE ONLY HAS FIVE PERCENT OVERHEAD IF IT'S TINY
AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT HOW COULD ONE SECTOR POSSIBLY TAKE MARKET SHARE AWAY FROM ANOTHER SECTOR IF IT
WE'VE ALL BEEN TAUGHT THAT THE BAKE SALE WITH FIVE PERCENT OVERHEAD IS MORALLY SUPERIOR TO THE PROFESSIONAL FUNDRAISING
I SAID THAT CHARITABLE GIVING IS TWO PERCENT OF GDP IN THE UNITED STATES
BUT ONLY ABOUT 20 PERCENT OF THAT OR 60 BILLION DOLLARS GOES TO HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES CAUSES
THIS CREATED A REAL PROBLEM FOR THESE PEOPLE
AND SOCIAL BUSINESS NEEDS MARKETS AND THERE ARE SOME ISSUES FOR WHICH YOU JUST CAN'T DEVELOP THE KIND OF MONEY MEASURES THAT YOU NEED FOR A
BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE WORKING
WE'LL PUT YOU ON THE COVER OF WIRED MAGAZINE
THE THIRD IS THAT MOST OF THE PEOPLE ON THIS PLANET STILL TO THIS DAY HAVE INSUFFICIENT ACCESS TO MEDICINES
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT IS THE OPIUM POPPY
IT'S FROM THIS PLANT THAT WE GET MANY OF OUR MOST EFFECTIVE PAIN MEDICINES
THESE WERE QUESTIONS THAT WERE ALL ABOUT HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW YOUR COUNTRY
I WANTED EVERYONE TO ENGAGE WITH IT
WAS MORE THAN I COULD HAVE HOPED FOR
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT
WE DIDN'T SEE WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS
BUT OF COURSE MY LAZY PERFECTIONIST SELF DOES NOT LIKE BEING REMINDED WHEN I DO THINGS
I WISH I KNEW HOW TO LET GO SOMETIMES AND REMOVE MYSELF FROM THE MORE AGGRESSIVE PARTS OF
ALL THEY REALLY DO IS GUIDE CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN PEOPLE IN CONFLICT SO THEY CAN COME TO THEIR OWN
SHE FIXED THE DOORKNOB AND THEN OFFERED TO TAKE THE TOOLS BACK DOWNSTAIRS
I HAD TO APOLOGIZE TO THE PEOPLE I HAD HURT
AND THEN I SPENT THE NEXT TWO HOURS THINKING ABOUT THAT IDEA
IT'S IN A WAY LIKE A TYPE OF MRI SCAN WHICH WILL ALSO GIVE YOU GENOMIC INFORMATION
I HAVE ACTUALLY LOST ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS FROM SCHOOL TO THIS DISEASE
AND ONE EXAMPLE OF A GENETIC DISEASE WHICH IS SEX LINKED IS HEMOPHILIA WHICH IS A GENETIC DISORDER
NOW IF REGARDED THE RELEASE OF DNA FROM A BABY INTO HIS MOTHER'S BLOOD
WE CALL THIS PLASMA DNA TISSUE MAPPING
SHE WANTED TO KNOW WHETHER HER BABY IS HEALTHY OR NOT
SO BY USING THIS PLASMA DNA TISSUE MAPPING IT WILL BASICALLY ALLOW US TO MONITOR CELL DEATH FROM DIFFERENT PARTS
I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE
NOW RECENTLY A PREGNANT WOMAN SENT HER BLOOD SAMPLE TO OUR LABORATORY FOR PRE NATAL TESTING
AND EVERY TIME WE DO THIS THERE IS A CHANCE THAT THE BABY MIGHT MISCARRY
I EVEN MANAGED TO PERSUADE A PROFESSOR IN OXFORD TO LET ME WORK IN HIS LABORATORY FOR A FEW MONTHS
AND TO DIAGNOSE THESE DISEASES A DOCTOR WOULD FREQUENTLY HAVE TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE CELLS WITH
AND I SAW NO SIGNAL IF A MOTHER IS CARRYING A BABY GIRL
AND IF YOU GO OUT HERE INTO CRACOW YOU WILL SEE CHURCHES THAT ARE IDENTICAL TO CHURCHES YOU'LL
AND HOW DO WE LEARN TO EMPATHIZE
GO OUT OF HERE YOU ARE IN A BAROQUE OR RENAISSANCE CITY
BECAUSE HE'S JOLLY MUCH BETTER THAN THE CHAMP WE HAVE
THIS IS A BRAVE NEW WORLD
THAT'S NOT REALLY THE WAY TO GET INTO PEOPLES MINDS IS IT
TO ADD TO WE SHOULD HAVE PHOTOGRAPHS WE SHOULD HAVE COMPETITIONS FOR HOW TO SAVE THE HOUSE WHAT
HAVE YOU BEEN TO A MUSEUM TO SEE HOW PEOPLE USED TO BE
CAN YOU BE HEARD
PEOPLE FOUND NEW WAYS TO USE OLD BUILDINGS
THERE ARE STILL GREAT GRANDPARENTS ALIVE OF SCHOOL CHILDREN TODAY WHO COULD BE INTERVIEWING MAKING
BUT WHAT'S THE POINT TO BEING SO CONSPICUOUS
I LOST MY FACE
I WHISTLED ALONE I WHISTLED IN THE CLASSROOM I WHISTLED ON BIKE I WHISTLED EVERYWHERE
AND I ALSO WHISTLED AT A CHRISTMAS EVE PARTY WITH MY FAMILY IN LAW
BUT IT CAN ALSO SOUND LIKE THIS
CAN WE MAKE THEM SMARTER
OLD HUMAN BLOOD I DIDN'T SHOW YOU DOES NOT HAVE THIS EFFECT IT DOES NOT MAKE THE MICE YOUNGER
NOW I DON'T THINK WE WILL LIVE FOREVER
HE'S WHISPERING INTO YOUR EARS
THEY OFFERED ME A SEAT NEXT TO THEM
I COULD BE FREE FROM MY DEPRESSION
1 PERCENT AVERAGE GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH OVER THE NEXT 15 YEARS WHICH MEANS THAT IN
BECAUSE THE SOCIAL PROGRESS INDEX ALSO HAS SOME VERY GOOD NEWS
AND NOW WE CAN USE THIS INFORMATION TO START BUILDING OUR FORECAST
AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BE RICH COUNTRIES SCORING STRAIGHT A'S
LET'S DEMAND A DIFFERENT PATH
OUR CHOICES MATTER IF WE PRIORITIZE THE WELL BEING OF PEOPLE THEN WE CAN MAKE A LOT MORE
AND WE NEED TO HOLD THEM TO THAT PROMISE BY HOLDING THEM ACCOUNTABLE TRACKING THEIR PROGRESS ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE NEXT 15
HOW RICH ARE WE GOING TO BE IN 2030
IN THE NEXT DECADE
THIS YEAR GLOBAL POVERTY IS GOING TO FALL TO 12 PERCENT
WELL THE SOCIAL PROGRESS INDEX CAN HELP US CALCULATE THIS BECAUSE AS YOU MIGHT HAVE NOTICED THERE ARE NO ECONOMIC
HIGH VITAMIN D LEVELS I THINK ARE A MARKER FOR SUNLIGHT EXPOSURE AND SUNLIGHT
IN WINTER OR SUMMER IT'S THE SAME AMOUNT OF LIGHT
SO IT'S NOT JUST IN THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM IT ARISES
AND THAT REALLY PREVENTED THE RICKETS THAT USED TO BE COMMON IN THIS CITY
IT ALSO DILATES THE CORONARY ARTERIES SO IT STOPS ANGINA
IF YOUR LEG IS CHOPPED OFF AND YOU LOSE BLOOD YOUR BODY WILL CLAMP DOWN INCREASE THE HEART RATE DO EVERYTHING IT CAN TO KEEP YOUR
WE COULDN'T TURN OFF THE NITRIC OXIDE
WE THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
IT ARISES IN THE SKIN
HOW DO YOU HAVE LOW BLOOD PRESSURE IN YOUR SKIN
AND I AS A CHILD WAS FED COD LIVER OIL BY MY GRANDMOTHER
AND WE NEED VITAMIN D
IT'S NOW A REQUIREMENT THAT CHILDREN HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT
MY GRANDMOTHER GREW UP IN GLASGOW BACK IN THE 1920S AND 30S WHEN RICKETS WAS A REAL PROBLEM AND COD
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I SPEND QUALITY TIME WITH THEM
CAN YOU IMAGINE AN OBJECT LIKE THAT IN THE MACRO WORLD
AND WE ARE VERY HAPPY TO BE PART OF THE TED FAMILY
WHEN IS IT GOING TO BE AWESOME LIKE IT OUGHT TO BE
ALL PAPYRUS CAME FROM EGYPT
SIX HUNDRED MORE YEARS BEFORE THEY FULLY EXPLOITED THE NEW TECHNOLOGY
THE LAST TIME THERE WAS A REVOLUTION IN IT OF SIMILAR MAGNITUDE WAS
THESE ARE LINEAR PROCESSES AND A ROLL OF PAPYRUS WAS GREAT FOR CAPTURING THAT
FOR THE FIRST THOUSAND YEARS READING WAS SOMETHING YOU DID OUT LOUD
THEY GROW WELL IN MANY MANY COUNTRIES
VOILA THE OXYGEN THAT WE ALL NEED TO SURVIVE
SO THANK YOU NASA
WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED BRINGING UP A LOT OF OUR REHABILITATION PROGRAMS
SO WELCOME AND THANK YOU ON BEHALF OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION
YEP THAT WAS IT
AT OUR HUMAN RIGHT CENTER AT GENT UNIVERSITY WE DID LEGAL RESEARCH ON THAT CHECKING THE PROPOSED BAN
AND WHEN THESE UNITED NATIONS BODIES TALK TO THE FRENCH REPUBLIC AND ISSUE THEIR VERY
THAT GRAVE DATES TO AROUND 450 AD
IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE OF THE SORT OF WORKS THEY WERE DOING IN LIFE
OF COURSE WE SHOULD
GAMING IS VERY INTERESTING
NOW WHAT DOES THAT NUMBER REPRESENT
I TALKED TO HANNAH ABOUT THE MEANING OF THAT ART
WHAT I'VE DISCOVERED FROM THE RESEARCH BUT NOT JUST WHAT I'VE DISCOVERED FROM THE RESEARCH WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY PRACTICING IN OUR HOME
AND THEY CONSTRUCT STUFF
NOW THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE HERE BECAUSE IN OUR HOUSE WHAT WE DO IS WE CELEBRATE CREATIVITY
HE SPOKE ABOUT EDUCATION
WE PLAN EVERYTHING FOR THEM AND IN FACT WHAT CHILDREN NEED IS UNSTRUCTURED TIME
IN THE BOOKCASE I'M A BIG FAN OF BANSKY THE GRAFFITI ARTIST THERE'RE BOOKS ABOUT BANSKY
NOW THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE IMPORTANT HERE AND THAT IS DIVERGENT THINKING
IT'S ALSO PARENTS THAT KILL CREATIVITY
I READ A PAPER RECENTLY ABOUT GAMING
WHAT THAT NUMBER ACTUALLY REPRESENTS IS THE MOST WATCHED TED TALK OF ALL TIME BECAUSE THAT'S HOW MANY VIEWS SIR KEN
WE SHOULD ALLOW FOR THOSE MULTI DAY PLAY ACTIVITIES
WHEN DO WE GET THAT RUSH OF OXYTOCIN IT'S WHEN WE'RE IN DEEPLY LOVING AFFECTIONATE RELATIONSHIPS
NOW WHAT'S THE PROBLEM A BIG PROBLEM WITH MODERN SOCIETY IS THAT WE HAVE THE TOY INDUSTRIES AND THE ENTERTAINMENT
BUT IN PARTICULAR WHAT HE FOCUSED ON WAS THE PROBLEM WITH EDUCATION
WE PUT TOO MUCH PRESSURE ON OUR KIDS IN TERMS OF UNIVERSITY AND ENTRANCE AND ALL THAT STUFF
SO WHAT I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU OVER THE NEXT TEN MINUTES OR SO IS WHAT I HAVE DISCOVERED
THE ANSWER IS A HOLE
SOMETIMES WE HIRE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE LANGUAGES BUT OFTEN WE TRAIN
THE CLOSER YOU MEASURE THE LONGER IT IS
BUT FAST FORWARD EVEN TODAY I WILL READILY ADMIT THAT IT IS SO MUCH
SO WAS MY MOM
EPIGENETICS GIVES US A RATIONALE THAT WHAT WE EAT AND DO CAN NOT ONLY AFFECT
THIS IS KEY BECAUSE IF WE CAN LEARN TO IDENTIFY DISEASE EARLIER WE CAN REVERSE AND
WE NEED MANY MORE OF THEM IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IF WE'RE TRULY GOING TO HAVE IT BE EFFECTIVE TO MOVE FROM A SICKCARE SYSTEM TO A HEALTHCARE
FOR INSTANCE THAT WOULD MEAN THAT WE NEED 25000 UPSTREAMISTS BY THE YEAR 2020
DOCTORS AND NURSES CAN GET BETTER AT ASKING ABOUT THE CONTEXT OF PATIENTS' LIVES NOT SIMPLY BECAUSE IT'S BETTER
DO YOU HAVE ROACHES IN YOUR HOME
OVER TIME THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL BUT NOT REALLY AS MUCH AS THEY WANT TO BE
IT'S ONE TWO AND THREE
WITH YOUR BACK AGAINST THE BARS WHICH CONFINE YOU AND YOUR SOUL FREE FROM THE SHACKLES WHICH HELD YOU BOUND
I KNOW WE WILL MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME AS WE WALK THROUGH THIS WORLD HAND IN HAND
MY CALL TO ACTION TODAY IS A VERY SIMPLE ONE IT WOULD REQUIRE ONLY A RULE CHANGE AND THAT WOULD BE TO
SHE GOES HOME AND SHE SEES HER MOTHER AND MOTHER GIVES HER A GREAT HUG AND SAYS DEBBIE YOU'RE WONDERFUL YOUR GRANDFATHER WOULD
THE TRICK IS TO GET THEM TO USE THE SAME VOCABULARY
BUT IT'S NOT JUST TO THROW PEOPLE TOGETHER THERE NEEDS TO BE A BOUNDARY THERE NEEDS TO BE A STRUCTURE ON HOW
THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS TODAY
BUT ONCE YOU DO MAGIC CAN HAPPEN
YOU CAN START THINKING ABOUT COLLABORATION YOU CAN ACTUALLY MANIPULATE THE SAME HOLOGRAM WITH
AND WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING YOU MAY NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS STORY WHICH I FIND REALLY INTERESTING
WE DON'T NEED A REASON
AND THEY CAUGHT A COUPLE OF MY GUYS WHO HAD HIDDEN CAMERAS IN DUFFEL BAGS
THE NEXT PROJECT I WANT TO SHOW WAS GIVEN TO ME IN AN EMAIL FROM A STRANGER
ONE THING THE MANAGERS WERE TRYING TO DO WAS TO TRACK DOWN OUR CAMERAS
IT'S THAT THERE IS NO POINT AND THAT THERE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A POINT
IT'S A PRANK BUT IT'S A PRANK THAT GIVES SOMEBODY A GREAT STORY TO TELL
AND HER REACTION INSPIRED ME TO DO A SECOND ANNUAL NO PANTS SUBWAY RIDE
AND WE'VE CONTINUED TO DO IT EVERY YEAR
BUT I NEVER FELT THAT CONNECTION
TIDY BOOTS IS VERY FUSSY ABOUT HIS FOOTWEAR
IT'S QUITE DIFFICULT TO FUND A PRIVATE SCHOOL EDUCATION AND FEED HIS ARMY OF CHILDREN
WE NEVER SPOKE TO EACH OTHER FOR THREE DECADES AND THEN A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO I DECIDED TO TURN THE SPOTLIGHT ON HIM
ACTUALLY YOU ARE
THEY INVENTED THAT TRADITION FOR THEIR ARRIVAL HERE
THEY MIGHT FEEL THAT THEY DIDN'T GET THE RIGHT ONE
BOTH OF THESE PROBLEMS CAN BE SOLVED BY ROBOTICS
AND WE CAN EVEN IMPROVE ON NATURE BY USING THOSE SAME PRINCIPLES IN NEW WAYS THAT NATURE
SO I'M NOW A PROFESSOR IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING BUT I ACTUALLY STARTED MY SCIENTIFIC CAREER IN A VETERINARY
SO THERE'S NO MECHANICAL COUPLING THERE'S ONLY AN ELECTRICAL COUPLING
OF COURSE WE CAN'T REDESIGN HUMAN LEGS BUT WE CAN ATTACH EXTRA TENDONS ON THE OUTSIDE
WHY DIDN'T THEY USE HORSES IN AFGHANISTAN
AND OF COURSE THEY SHOULD HAVE
WELL MY ANSWER IS
HUMAN BEINGS WE'RE REACTION MACHINES
YOU RETRACE THE FOOTSTEPS OF ABRAHAM
NOW AS ANTHROPOLOGISTS WE KNOW THAT EVERY CULTURE HAS AN ORIGIN STORY
WE'RE ABOUT TO TAKE A BREAK IN A MOMENT
THAT'S THE QUESTION
WHAT WOULD THE OAK TREE LOOK LIKE
WHAT DO I KNOW ABOUT PUERTO RICO
WHAT IS THE STORY THERE
YOU GO FOR A WALK IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF ABRAHAM
AND THAT'S WHAT COMES TO THE FIRST STEP HERE
AND SO SHE TOLD OUR TEAM THERE SHE SAID YOU HAVE MADE ME VISIBLE
THAT'S A THIRD SIDE ACT
THE PATH RIGHT NOW IS LIKE AN ACORN IT'S STILL IN ITS EARLY PHASE
WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN
HIS BASIC MESSAGE WAS UNITY TOO THE INTERCONNECTEDNESS OF IT ALL THE UNITY OF IT ALL
THEY GIVE MEANING TO OUR LIVES
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
PERHAPS THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL WAY IN WHICH THE THIRD SIDE CAN HELP IS TO REMIND THE
THE FIRST SON TOOK HIS HALF HALF OF 18 IS NINE
WE'RE ALL ONE FAMILY
HOW DO WE DEAL WITH OUR DIFFERENCES
THAT'S WALKING ABRAHAM'S PATH
SO I'M MULTITASKING FROM THE TIME I WAKE UP TO THE TIME I GO TO BED AND I AM ALWAYS PRESSED FOR TIME
THE STORY GOT PICKED UP BY NEWS OUTLETS ALL OVER THE WORLD
VINCENT WHICH IS A RETIREMENT HOME IN WEST SEATTLE AND THE INTERGENERATIONAL LEARNING CENTER WHICH IS THE
I ENDED UP BEING INTERVIEWED FOR TELEVISION AND RADIO AND BLOGS AND PODCASTS
AND THAT JUST MADE ME SO CURIOUS TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THIS MAN AND WHO HE HAD BEEN IN HIS LIFE UP
DOUBTFIRE FOR EXAMPLE THINGS LIKE THAT
SO ON OUR WAY THEY WERE COACHING US AND THEY EXPLAINED THAT THE RESIDENTS WERE GONNA BE SUPER EXCITED TO SEE US
IT'S BEEN IN THIS PARTICULAR LOCATION FOR ALMOST 25 YEARS
EXECUTION IS THE MEASURABLE RESULT OF THE PLANNING THAT YOU'VE HAD IN PLACE TO SOLVE SOMEBODY'S PAIN OR
I HAVE THE LUXURY OF NOT JUST LOOKING AT MISTRUST FROM THE FOUR BUSINESSES THAT I HAVE STARTED BUT I AM AN
LET'S GO BACK TO WHAT HEMINGWAY SAID ABOUT TRUSTING SOMEONE AS BEING THE BEST WAY TO TRUST THEM
THIS IS USUALLY YOU SOLVING A PROBLEM OR A PAIN
AND LIKE A LOT OF OTHER FOLKS AT THE TIME I WAS FORCED OUT OF MY JOB AND INTO STARTING MY FIRST COMPANY
LETS PUT IT THIS WAY
I USED TO HAVE A LOVELY HEAD OF HAIR
BUT TO ME THE MOST EXCITING PART OF IT IS THE DATA THAT WE'RE GATHERING
WE PREFERRED OPEN ENDED QUESTIONS
AND WE SUCCEEDED
SEBASTIAN'S TEACHING ANOTHER CLASS NOW
SO WHAT I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT NEXT TIME SOMEBODY WANTS TO MAKE SOME VAST GENERALIZATION ABOUT RELIGION IS THAT MAYBE
JUST ANOTHER BALD EAGLE
HE USED ONE TO BUY THE PROPERTY AND ANOTHER WHICH WAS IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S NAME TO PAY THE HUGE BILLS
NOW LET'S GO BACK TO THE OIL AND MINING COMPANIES AND LET'S GO BACK TO DAN ETETE AND THAT 1 BILLION DEAL
WELL SOME OF THAT SPRANG FROM OUR WORK
IN 2011 NATURAL RESOURCE EXPORTS OUTWEIGHED AID FLOWS BY
WELL WE'VE ALL HEARD ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE I THINK AND WE ALL KNOW THEY'RE USED QUITE A BIT BY
IN THE OIL AND MINING SECTOR FOR EXAMPLE THERE IS NOW THE BEGINNING OF A TRULY WORLDWIDE
SO THIS IS CHANGE HAPPENING
UNTIL HIS DEATH IN 2006 HE WAS THE ALL POWERFUL LEADER OF TURKMENISTAN A CENTRAL ASIAN
BUT DOES IT JUST HAPPEN OVER THERE
PERHAPS YOU SAW THE FILM THE HOLLYWOOD FILM BLOOD DIAMOND THE ONE WITH LEONARDO DICAPRIO
SAPARMURAT NIYAZOV HE WAS ONE OF THEM
IF THERE IS ONE FOR ME THIS IS IT TO HELP THIS HAPPEN
WE SEE IT AT THE D
AND BRIAN'S SHOULDERS SANK
TO WHICH HE REPORTED MOST OF THEM REPLIED HELL NO
THEY WERE CURED
THAT TRANSFORMATION IS AMAZING
I SEE THINGS LIKE GROUNDWATER OVERDRAFT
HOW WE CAN CHOOSE TO HAVE LOCAL AGRICULTURE HOW WE CAN CHOOSE TO HAVE LOCAL WATER MANAGEMENT HOW WE CAN
MY BACKGROUND IS AS A SCIENTIST
THIS IS THE KIND OF NARRATIVE THAT HAS TO BE CHANGED
THERE'S TREMENDOUS OVER PUMPING
HOW INSTEAD OF TALKING INDIVIDUALLY WE CAN TALK AS GROUPS
BUT IT'S ALSO THE SLIGHT SHIFT IN BALANCE AND TELLING THAT STORY
I FORMED AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION
SO IT'S INNOVATING
SO AS I LOOK AT IT I GO THROUGH THE ELEMENTS OF THE THREAT
THE WORLD I LIVE IN IS FULL OF REPORTS AND PAPERS
THERE ARE FIVE OR TEN PEOPLE WHO READ THE DETAILS OF ALL OF IT
IT DOESN'T COMMUNICATE TO EVERYBODY AND IT DOESN'T GIVE THAT TANGIBLE SENSE OF WHAT WE CAN REALLY
A POLAR BEAR TO EVOLVE A COAT WILL TAKE THOUSANDS OF GENERATIONS MAYBE 100000 YEARS
DARWINIAN EVOLUTION IS SLOW IT TAKES HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS
THIS IS WHAT I SPOKE ABOUT IN THE LAST TED
IT'S ALMOST AS THOUGH IT'S PERFORMING A VIRTUAL REALITY SIMULATION OF THE OTHER PERSON'S ACTION
FOR ONE THING THEY MUST BE INVOLVED IN THINGS LIKE IMITATION AND EMULATION
THEIR JOB IS TO HELP THE GROUP DECIDE
AND THE ANSWER IS IT'S ALREADY HAPPENING
SO HOW CAN I BE SO SURE ABOUT THIS
AND THAT'S WHAT DEMOCRACY IS
WELL IN ESTONIA THEIR E RESIDENCY PROGRAM ASKS USERS FOR FEEDBACK TO SUCH A
SO DON'T GET ME WRONG
THEY HAVE REALLY POWERFUL PROCESSES
WE CHOOSE ONE IDEOLOGY AND WE ADOPT IT WHOLESALE
AND SO THIS USED TO BE UNDERSTANDABLE RIGHT
WE COULDN'T VOTE ON EVERY ISSUE BECAUSE THE ONLY TECHNOLOGY WE HAD WAS PEN AND PAPER AND A
AND IF THAT INSIGHT HAD BEEN IN PLACE IN SAY THE SOVIET UNION 1920 LOTS OF THE HORRORS OF THE
PEOPLE CHANGE ALL THE TIME THE WORLD IS CHANGING AND YOU MAKE NEW DECISIONS EACH DAY
NO ONE CAN GRASP ALL THE DETAILS OF THE LONDON BREAD SUPPLY CHAIN SYSTEM
DO SOMETHING ELSE
BUT THE HEROES OF THIS STORY ARE ACTUALLY THE ONES THAT MADE THE CONSCIOUS EFFORT TO CHANGE THEIR OPINION BECAUSE THAT'S A VERY
BUT IT WORKS ANYWAY
HI THIS IS VLADIMIR I'M FROM MOSCOW AND WE HAVE THIS SLIGHT PROBLEM TRYING TO CONVERT OURSELVES
THAT'S THE POWER OF SELF ORGANIZING COMPLEX SOCIAL SYSTEMS
NO ONE REALLY PLANS THIS
ONE OF THE BEST FORCES OUT THERE TO HELP UNDERSTAND ALL OF THIS THOUGH HAS BEEN ONE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITIES
SO THERE'S LOTS OF NOISE AND LOTS OF THINGS CAN GO WRONG
BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE GROWING A PLANT WHERE IT TAKES PERHAPS SEVERAL YEARS TO DO A SINGLE EXPERIMENT
DO ALL YOUR PIPES SUDDENLY GET DIGESTED
I WAS SCARED TO SAY THAT MY MUM HAD COMMITTED SUICIDE
AFTER A WHILE SHE CAME UP TO ME SHE HUGGED ME AND SHE SAID THANK YOU
FOR EXAMPLE IF I GO TO A PSYCHIATRIST SAYING THAT I WANT TO COMMIT SUICIDE OR I HAVE EVEN TRIED TO
AND I WOULD LIE I WOULD SAY THAT IT WAS CANCER OR A HEART ATTACK
SHE TOLD US THAT SHE HAD BEEN SUFFERING WITH A DEPRESSION FOR OVER FIVE YEARS AND THAT SHE DIDN'T ASK FOR
SHE WAS THAT TYPE OF FRIEND YOU WANT TO HAVE BECAUSE SHE MADE YOU FEEL MORE ALIVE
THIS MEANS THAT IF IT IS NOT YOU IT IS SOMEBODY SITTING NEXT TO YOU
REMEMBER ALEX ONLY 13
WHAT A STRANGE THING
MY AUNT HAS THIS BEAUTIFUL PERSIAN CAT
MEDIA CAN BE SO POWERFUL TO CREATE IGNORANCE AND DISTORT THE VIEW OF A GROUP OF
FOR GOD'S SAKE I USED TO WRITE ABOUT IT
ALL WE HAD WAS TWO SUITCASES
ABOUT THE SAME TIME I MADE A NEW FRIEND AMANDINE FROM PARIS
AND TODAY I'M HERE ON THIS STAGE FOUR YEARS AFTER MY ARRIVAL IN THE US AND IF YOU ASK ME WHO
AND THE THIRD CHAPTER OF THIS STORY GOES BEYOND INTRODUCING A COUNTRY IN THE MIDDLE EAST
A GROUP WORKING ON RECEPTION DAY PREPARING PERSIAN SNACKS OF COURSE WITH SAFFRON
WE REACHED OUT TO OTHER PHOTOGRAPHERS AND EVEN BLOGGERS WHO HAD GOOD PHOTOS OF IRAN
BY THAT TIME I HAD SEVERAL PRESENTATIONS ABOUT IRAN EVEN ITS ANCIENT SUSTAINABLE ARCHITECTURE ITS CULTURE
I WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT SOMETHING MORE SELF EXPLANATORY THAT INSTEAD OF ME TALKING TO
AND THE THIRD AND MY FAVORITE GROUP THEY WOULD REACT LIKE THIS SO YOU'RE PERSIAN
EVERYTHING SEEMED GOOD AND TO BE GOING ACCORDING TO PLAN
THE SECOND GROUP THEY WOULD GO LIKE THIS AFTER I INTRODUCED MYSELF AND MY NATIONALITY THEY WOULD PAUSE THINK
I COULD SEE IN THEIR EYES THE FLASHBACK TO ALL THE NEWS OUT THERE
WE ARE NOT EQUIPPED FOR THE 21ST CENTURY
BUT MY POINT IS IF WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THIS STUFF AND WE DON'T LEARN HOW TO DEAL WITH OUR LIVES IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ONE IN FOUR
THERE IS SOME GOOD NEWS
WHAT ONCE MADE YOU SAFE NOW DRIVES YOU INSANE
I GOT SOME BAD NEWS
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED
I DON'T LIVE IN A TOWNSHIP
SO HERE'S MY QUESTION
I FELT RELEVANT
THOUGHTS FLOODED MY MIND
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
AND SADLY SUICIDE UP
I WANT YOU TO HAVE ONE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH EXPERT ON YOUR TEAM JUST TO PROTECT YOU FROM YOURSELVES
THANK GOODNESS WOMEN AREN'T AS AFFLICTED WITH THIS CHALLENGE
WE CONSOLIDATED WE MOVED TO A NEW POSITION
SO THEY COME TO US AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING
DIVORCE RATE UP
CAN I CALL YOU BACK IN A COUPLE OF DAYS
I GAVE HER OUR ANSWERS
30 AT NIGHT DRIVING DOWN HIGHWAY 19 IN CLEARWATER FLORIDA
ABSOLUTELY LET'S DO IT
THAT WAS GOOD THINKING
THEY DON'T WANT TO GO INTO THE SYSTEM THEY FEAR THE SYSTEM
SHE CHALLENGED ME
WE HAD TO RESPOND WE HAD TO INTERVENE
I GOT TO TAMPA DECEMBER BEFORE CHRISTMAS
SUICIDAL IDEATIONS ARE GOING UP AND THAT'S A GOOD THING BECAUSE THAT MEANS PEOPLE ARE IDENTIFYING SELF IDENTIFYING
IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING ELSE
FIRE BROKE OUT AGAIN A SECOND TIME
HOW DID HE DIE
THE ROUNDS COULD BE HEARD EVERYWHERE
AND WHEN YOU HEAR THAT PHRASE IN THE NEWS THE FOG OF WAR I'M HERE TO TELL YOU IT'S REAL
I HAD A SEVEN MONTH PERIOD IN MY LIFE WHERE I KEPT A LOG
WHICH GOT ME THINKING ABOUT WHAT MAKES NIGERIA HOME EVEN WHEN I HAVEN'T BEEN THERE FOR
I GREW UP CALLING EVERY SINGLE NIGERIAN WOMEN AUNTY AND COUSIN WAS
IF YOU WANT TO REMEMBER THE IMPORTANCE OF THE BEAT REMEMBER HOW IT WORKS
SING IT TOGETHER
AND WHY IS THAT
SO LET'S START WITH THE RIGHT FOOT WHEN IT COMES TO ENVIRONMENT
WE WERE DRINKING CHAI AND WE STARTED TALKING ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THIS AREA
ALTHOUGH THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICAN COUNTRIES ARE CONSIDERED TO BE AMONG THE LOWEST
MOST OF THE TIME IT'S BECAUSE OF A DUST STORM EPISODE HAPPENING IN BAGHDAD BASRAH OR THE
THE BEGINNING BEGINS RIGHT
I WORK WITH THOSE PEOPLE I SEE THOSE PEOPLE EVERY SINGLE DAY AND ACTUALLY THIS WAS ONE OF THE REASONS
IS IRAQ AN ACTIVE PART OF THIS GAME OR NOT
LET'S SET IRAQ AS AN EXAMPLE AS A BENCHMARK FOR THE NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES AND
BUT THE WORLD IN A WAY IS FIGHTING BACK
AND WHAT ABOUT IRAQ
THE SHARYEE IS A SOUTHERN WIND THAT USUALLY BLOWS LATE APRIL AND LATE
BUT IT'S A MATTER OF SCALE
BUT WHAT ABOUT IRAQ
HOW IS IRAQ AFFECTED BY THOSE CHANGES
AND INSTEAD OF SPENDING TIME WITH MY WIFE I STILL CHECKED MY E MAILS EVERY TWO
AND THIS RITUAL HAS HELPED ME TO SEE THAT
SECOND THING I LEARNED
SO I KNEW EXACTLY HOW TO BECOME HAPPY BUT I FAILED TO LIVE BY THESE INSIGHTS
HERE IS A RITUAL THAT WORKS FOR ME
IT COULD BE PRACTICING GRATITUDE LIKE I DO
OF COURSE NOT
WHAT ABOUT MESSI
I WAS COMPLETELY IMMERSED IN THE RAT RACE TO ENDLESS SELF IMPROVEMENT
YOU COULD SAY I WAS PRACTICALLY ADDICTED TO IT
A SELF HELP BOOK ON PUBLIC SPEAKING
BUT AGAIN THEY'RE GROSSLY INEFFICIENT BECAUSE THEY CHANGE THE CHEMISTRY OF THE BRAIN AS A WHOLE AS OPPOSED TO THOSE SPECIFIC
AND DAD I LOVE YOU
AND SO I ALREADY KNOW WHAT YOU ARE THINKING
IN TALKING WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS I BECAME INCREASINGLY FRUSTRATED BY HOW WE AS THIS SUPPORT NETWORK
OH I LOVE YOU
THEY ARE NOT AFRAID OF USING CRAZY INGREDIENTS LIKE TONKA BEANS FROM AMAZONIA
IS IT GOLDEN BLOND
IS IT AMBER BLOND
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE AT THIS POINT WHEN WE HAVE THESE ADVANCES IN THE GRAPHENE PRODUCTION MANY THINGS
SO GRAPHENE IS BEING DISTORTED AND THE CONSEQUENCE OF IT IS THAT ELECTRONS ON
SO WE STARTED TAKING THESE GROUPS
I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY KNOWS IT
SO HE TRIED PLAN B
HERE IS MY NAIVE ADVERTISING MAN'S SUGGESTION
THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE BY THE WAY THAT THINGS LIKE SOCIAL NETWORKING HELP DO THAT
YOU START WITH 12 AND THEY TAKE THEM AWAY
SO THEY ACTUALLY REDUCE THE NEED FOR ACTUALLY SPENDING GREAT MONEY ON DISPLAY AND INCREASE THE KIND OF THIRD PARTY ENJOYMENT
HE TRIED THE MARKETING SOLUTION WHICH IS HE DECLARED THE POTATO AS A ROYAL VEGETABLE AND NONE BUT THE ROYAL FAMILY COULD CONSUME IT
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT IF YOU WANT TO LIVE IN A WORLD IN THE FUTURE WHERE THERE ARE FEWER MATERIAL GOODS YOU BASICALLY HAVE TWO
IT'S HELD EVERY TWO YEARS IN BURMA
THIS ACTUALLY HAD SYMBOLIC VALUE BADGE VALUE
IT SAID THAT YOUR FAMILY HAD MADE A GREAT SACRIFICE IN THE PAST
I'M JUST AN AD MAN
BUT THERE WAS A PROBLEM
WHAT DO THEY DO HOW DO YOU START SOMETHING LIKE THAT
I REALLY DON'T KNOW
SO WHAT I DID WAS AGAIN LIKE I DID WITH THE DODO SKULL I BLEW ALL MY REFERENCE UP TO FULL SIZE AND THEN I BEGAN
BUT AGAIN I AM NOT A SCULPTOR AND SO I DON'T KNOW A LOT OF THE TRICKS LIKE I DON'T KNOW HOW MY FRIEND MIKE GETS
YOU OPEN IT OPEN IT BUT YOU'RE NOT MAKING DECISIONS
AND SHE SAID YOU KEEP TELLING ME ABOUT IDEAS THAT YOU HAVE FOR YOUR BUSINESS AND THINGS YOU WANT TO
I WAS THE MODEL PATIENT
WE PICK SOMETHING UP WE PUT IT BACK DOWN
I HAD A VALVE DEFECT THAT I'D HAD MY WHOLE LIFE AND I HAD BEEN TOLD YOU'LL LIVE INTO
NOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT ALL OF YOUR POSTPONED DECISIONS ARE IN SOME OF THOSE AREAS PERHAPS YOU ALSO
SOME CLUTTER IS GOING TO COME BACK BOTH THE PHYSICAL KIND THE EMOTIONAL KIND THAT'S CALLED LIFE IT'S GOING TO KEEP COMING
NOW IT HAS TO HAVE AN ACTION JUST LIKE WITH THE PHYSICAL STUFF
YOU ARE STAYING STUCK ALSO
SOME ARE EASY
ONE PILE BECOMES TEN PILES AND THEN YOUR BOSS IS COMING IN OR YOU HAVE FRIENDS COMING OVER FOR DINNER AND YOU PUSH THEM
FROM BOOKS TO TV SHOWS TO MAGAZINES YOU CAN'T EVEN CHECK OUT AT THE GROCERY STORE WITHOUT SEEING THE WORD
THE CLOSETS THAT ARE OVERFLOWING THE GARAGES THAT CAN'T HOLD CARS THE STORAGE UNITS THAT HAVE BECOME
AND PERHAPS THE POSTPONED DECISION IS
THAT YOU'RE GOING INTO AN AUTOMOBILE DEALERSHIP TO BUY A CAR
AND PEOPLE WOULD STOP AND SIT BESIDE ROSE
THAT'S THE IMPORTANCE OF THE WHAT MATTERS TO YOU CONVERSATION
WELL THE END OF THE STORY IS THAT DON ENTERED SCOTLAND'S FIVE INCH
THAT'S A VERY COMPLEX THING TO DEAL WITH IN A HOSPITAL WARD
YOU MIGHT HAVE A 16 A 20 A 24 YOU MIGHT HAVE A 12
SO THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE DID
THIS IS PAIGE'S WHAT MATTERS TO YOU
WE USE IT TO DEHUMANIZE THE OTHER OR TO DIFFERENTIATE OURSELVES AND OUR REAL OR PERCEIVED
BESIDES THE GOVERNMENT'S THE BEST PHILANTHROPY IT'S THE BIGGEST PHILANTHROPY IN THE WORLD
TO TRY TO TRY OUT SOME OF THE IDEAS
WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE
WE DON'T WANT THIS PRIVATE SHADOW SOMEBODY WILL WORRY ABOUT THE SOURCE BEING A D OR AN R OR A BLAH
SHE'D BEEN VERY BUSY WITH OUR PHILANTHROPIC STUFF OVER THE LAST SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS AND SHE SAID WHY DON'T YOU COME
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH
I WAS HOPING I COULD FIND SOMETHING LIKE A 10 K DOCUMENT THAT THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
WE'RE A LITTLE BAND BUT WE GET A LOT OF HELP IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS
INFRASTRUCTURE EXPENDITURE IS MUCH IN THE PUBLIC EYE ACTUALLY WITH PRETTY
WHO BUILT THE ROAD IN FRONT OF YOUR HOUSE
THAT'S A QUESTION BY THE NUMBERS YOU CAN ANSWER THAT IS AN OUTCOME
AND THAT'S JUST AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL
WHAT ABOUT PHILANTHROPY AND CIVIC ACTIVISM AS OPPOSED TO RUNNING A BASKETBALL TEAM AND PAYING TAXES
FEDERAL INCOME TAX
I ASK PEOPLE
MAYBE EVEN IN THE WORST CASE IN SCHOOL NUMBERS WERE SOMETHING THAT YOU MEMORIZED FOR SOME PURPOSE SOME
THERE'S OVER 90000 INDEPENDENT GOVERNMENT JURISDICTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES
AND I SAID WELL YOU KNOW I'M JUST KIND OF KICKING BACK BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH
NOW I DON'T THINK OLD TOM BRADY USES THE SAME KIND OF TOOL I USE WHICH ARE NUMBERS
IF YOU WANTED TO UNDERSTAND REALLY THE SOURCES AND DRIVERS OF PROFITABILITY
SHE SAID OKAY YOU'VE LEFT MICROSOFT
I DIDN'T KNOW WHEN I STARTED THIS
THEY ARE CREATIVE PEOPLE EXPERIMENTING WITH THE BOUNDS OF WHAT IS POSSIBLE IN THIS MEDIUM
IT WAS MAYOR EMANUEL
THESE THREE CHARACTERS BROUGHT AN AUTHENTIC VISION FROM MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES
YOU LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE WEST WING TWITTER IN WHICH YOU HAVE THESE FICTIONAL CHARACTERS THAT ENGAGE WITH THE REAL WORLD
IT GAVE YOU EVERYTHING YOU WANTED FROM RAHM EMANUEL PARTICULARLY IN THE EXPLETIVE
IT WAS ALSO TWITTER AS A PRODUCTION MECHANISM
THINK ABOUT EPISODES THAT HAPPENED LIVE ON RADIO
IT WAS JUST HIM DIRECTLY CONNECTED WITH HIS AUDIENCE AND BUILDING ON THE FEEDBACK AND ENTHUSIASM THAT THEY WERE GIVING
YOU COULD TUNE IN TO A SHORT STORY FROM THE NEW YORKER'S FICTION ACCOUNT
I USED TO STUDY MICE
I GREW UP IN BALTIMORE AND I CHEW CRABS VERY VERY WELL
AND THE BASIC PUNCHLINE OF MY TALK IS I'D LIKE TO TURN THAT OVER ON ITS HEAD
WHEN I STUDIED MICE I USED TO TALK REALLY SLOWLY
SO I REALLY THINK THAT AS WE LEARN MORE IT'S GOING TO TURN OUT THAT THE WHOLE FLY BRAIN IS JUST LIKE A
IT'S A NON SPIKING CELL
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE A SIMPLE MODEL OF ANYTHING
I GREW UP WATCHING STAR TREK
I THINK THIS IS A FASCINATING BEHAVIOR THAT SHOWS HOW FAST THE FLY'S BRAIN CAN PROCESS INFORMATION
I LOVE STAR TREK
IT IS PHILOSOPHICALLY VERY INTERESTING TO REALIZE THAT ALL OUR CELLS ARE PROGRAMMED TO
BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS FOR EXAMPLE FOR CHILDHOOD CANCER
BUT RATHER THAN BE IMPRESSIVE I THINK IT'S SO MUCH BETTER WHEN YOU EMBRACE THE BEGINNING STAGE OF LANGUAGE LEARNING
BUT I ALWAYS DID WE ALL ALWAYS DO
SO LET'S SAY THERE'S SOME INBORN TRAIT TO GIVE SOMEBODY 20 ADVANTAGE OVER THE REST OF THE PEOPLE
AND I DO HAVE THE ABILITY I DO HAVE THE SKILL TO LEARN A LANGUAGE
AND I'VE DONE THIS WITH OTHER CULTURES AND OTHER LANGUAGES AND I EVEN MANAGED TO LEARN A LITTLE AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE
I'M NOT VERY SENSIBLE THOUGH
A LOT OF US START WITH THE WRONG MOTIVATION TO LEARN A LANGUAGE
THERE'S NO LANGUAGE GENE WE ALL HAVE IT ALREADY
8 RUPEES VERSUS 17 RUPEES
WE HAVE THE CAPITAL OF THE TECHNO PHILANTHROPIST
YOU CAN COUGH ON IT YOU CAN DO A FINGER BLOOD PRICK
WE HAVE THE PASSION OF THE DIY INNOVATOR
AND WE HAVE THREE BILLION NEW MINDS COMING ONLINE TO WORK WITH US TO SOLVE THE GRAND CHALLENGES
LAST MONTH MIT PUT OUT A STUDY SHOWING THAT BY THE END OF THIS DECADE IN THE SUNNY PARTS OF THE UNITED STATES
AND UP UNTIL NOW IT'S BEEN A SUPERCOMPUTER PROBLEM
THE RATE AT WHICH THE TECHNOLOGY IS GETTING FASTER IS ITSELF GETTING FASTER
YOU SEE EVEN THOUGH ALUMINUM IS 8
BECAUSE WE LIVE ON A WATER PLANET
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO OUR CITIES AND THINKING ABOUT HOW DEATH FITS IN OUR CITIES THERE'S MUCH LESS
ONLY 45 PERCENT OF PEOPLE HAVE EVER TALKED ABOUT THIS
AND THE REASONS THAT PEOPLE GIVE
BUT THEY'LL ALSO THINK ABOUT THINGS LIKE WHAT IMPACT IS IT GOING TO HAVE ON THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT
SO ACTUALLY IF YOU WANT TO GO AND MAKE YOUR OWN MINI CEMETERY THEN YOU CAN
BUT THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT FOR FORMAL REQUIREMENTS
THIS IS ONE OF X'S MANTRAS
THE WINDS ARE TOO STRONG IT WOULD BE BLOWN AWAY
AND THE PHOTOS I'M SHOWING HERE TODAY ARE SORT OF A MIX OF OUR WORK
AND TOGETHER THEY COLLABORATED ON A 3D PRINTED PROSTHETIC
NOW THERE ARE LOTS OF STORIES LIKE MINE
SCHOOLS LIBRARIES MAKER SPACES STUDIOS GARAGES AND WORKSHOPS
YOU KNOW WHAT I KNOW WHAT THIS SPACE LOOKS AND FEELS LIKE AND I KNOW WHERE I FIT INTO IT
THESE DAYS IT'S ACTUALLY NOT A PROBLEM
AND AS A DESIGNER DO I DEVALUE MY WORK WHEN I GIVE IT AWAY FOR FREE OR
WHY WOULD I MAKE MY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND HARD WORK AVAILABLE FOR FREE
WHAT IF I DON'T OWN A 3D PRINTER
3D FORMS ARE REALLY HARD TO REPRESENT ON 2D PIECES OF PAPER OR A 2D COMPUTER SCREEN
INITIALLY THIS DYNAMIC FELT REALLY FOREIGN TO ME
SO THIS IS WHERE I WANNA TELL A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW I'VE BEEN USING 3D PRINTERS
WHETHER IT'S A CAR OR A PHONE PRODUCT DESIGNERS USE PROTOTYPES TO TEST THE
BUT THOSE FIRST 3D PRINTERS WERE REALLY EXPENSIVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AND SO THEY WERE REALLY ONLY
PARTLY BECAUSE THE PATENTS STARTED TO EXPIRE
THEY FELT THAT WE ARE AVAILABLE
AND I THINK IT'S THE ONLY TIME IN OUR LIFE WE ARE VERY HAPPY GAINING WEIGHT
WE NEED TO GO BACK TO THE CONTACT CONNECTION AND COMPASSION
AND WHAT ARE OUR BASICS
AND WHEN PRE TERMS ARE BEING TOUCHED IT IMPROVES THEIR WEIGHT GAIN
IT'S TOO PAINFUL
SO WE TEXT THEM AN SMS UPDATE
MY FIRST ARE TWIN BOYS
AND IT WAS VERY EMOTIONAL FOR BOTH OF US
ASK YOURSELF EVERY DAY
THEY SPEND WEEKS AND MONTHS IN OUR DEPARTMENT
AND IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME
THEY ARE SO SMALL
AND ONLY 48 HOURS LATER WE GOT THE PERMISSION TO GO HOME
WE BRING A ONE POUND BABY TO GROW INTO A 100 POUND PERSON
IT'S REALLY AMAZING
FOR A LONG TIME PEOPLE SAID THAT A BASIC INCOME IS IMPOSSIBLE
IF YOU HAVE A BASIC INCOME THAT'S EQUAL FOR EVERYBODY THE RELATIVELY POOR THE RELATIVELY
SONIA GANDHI TOLD US THAT
VISION IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS WE DO
AND IT'S SO COMPLEX THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
HOW MUCH DO YOU CARE ABOUT PEOPLE
IT'S LIKE HAVING YOUR CAR STOLEN
NOT YOURS OF COURSE OTHER PEOPLE'S
AND IF WE HAVE THESE PREDICTABLE REPEATABLE MISTAKES IN VISION WHICH WE'RE SO GOOD AT WHAT ARE THE CHANCES WE WON'T MAKE
IT'S NOT BECAUSE WE DON'T CARE
IT'S NOT BECAUSE IT'S TRIVIAL
LET'S GO FOR HIP REPLACEMENT
THE GENERAL IDEA HERE BY THE WAY IS THAT WE ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW OUR PREFERENCES THAT WELL
SO YOU REFER THE PATIENT FOR HIP REPLACEMENT THERAPY
OR MAYBE IT'S ABOUT RELIGION
THIS IS WHY WE HAVE THESE FOUR MINUTE DATES
SO I DECIDED TO TRY AND WRITE SOMETHING MORE FUN
I WAS QUITE EXCITED ABOUT THIS
YOU KNOW WE WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND WE FEEL WE MAKE DECISIONS
WE OPEN THE REFRIGERATOR AND WE FEEL THAT WE DECIDE WHAT TO EAT
I WAS COMPLETELY IMMERSED IN IT
BUT NOW I BEGAN TO QUESTION HOW I KNEW WHAT I KNEW
AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS JIHAD
THEY CAN REGAIN THEIR HEARTS AND RESTORE THEM BY FILLING THEM WITH HUMAN VALUES THAT HEAL
APPROACH THE WORLD LIFE WITH LOVE
AND IT WAS THE SAME EVERYWHERE
THE WORD JIHAD STANDS FOR ALL THOSE MEANINGS AS A WHOLE
SO I BECAME INVOLVED IN THE JIHAD IN AFGHANISTAN
I WANTED TO PROTECT THE MUSLIM AFGHAN POPULATION AGAINST THE SOVIET ARMY
AND TO MAKE BETTER USE OF THEIR VALUE
OLDER PEOPLE HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE
AT THE WORST EXTREME MANY TRADITIONAL SOCIETIES GET RID OF THEIR ELDERLY IN ONE OF FOUR
IT HAPPENS MAINLY UNDER TWO CONDITIONS
THIS SUBJECT CONSTITUTES JUST ONE CHAPTER OF MY LATEST BOOK WHICH COMPARES TRADITIONAL
HERE'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE
THIS STUFF IS HAPPENING NOW
LET GO OF THE STEREOTYPES LET GO OF THE FANTASY AND TOGETHER WE CAN HAVE SOME INTELLIGENT CONVERSATIONS
THEY ATE A LOT MORE ANIMAL FAT ANIMAL PROTEIN
SO I JUST WANT TO PREPARE YOU FOR THAT AHEAD OF TIME
I JUST WANT TO TALK A MINUTE ABOUT THE USE OF COMMUNITY IN MEDICINE
TECHNOLOGY IS COMING ALONG AND EMPOWERING COMMUNICATION IN NEW AND EXCITING WAYS
BUT THE OUTCOMES REMAIN THE SAME
AND WHAT ABOUT DOCTORS
AND THE HUMAN MICROBIOME SHOWED THAT MORE THAN 99 OF ALL OF THE GERMS THAT LIVE
NOW WHAT IS THE MOST EVIDENCE BASED THING THAT YOU COULD ALL DO TODAY TO START THIS PROCESS OF DEVELOPING
AND BETTING ON IT FOR THE FUTURE OF CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT
IT'S NOT JUST COMMUNITY
AND 15000 OF THE PEOPLE THAT GO TO THE CHURCH LOST A COMBINED
THEY ALSO SMOKED AND DRANK AS MUCH AS THE OTHER TOWNS AROUND THEM IN AMERICA
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE HUMAN RACE DOMINATING GERMS
BUT WE CAN TALK ABOUT MICROBES IF YOU PREFER
START PLANTING A GARDEN
17 YEARS EVEN TODAY
AND SINCE THEN IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS THERE'S BEEN A WEALTH OF SCIENCE TO SHOW THAT GERMS
ONE OF THE BEST THINGS THE EMERGING SCIENCE THAT'S COMING OUT RIGHT NOW CITIZEN SCIENCE PROJECT IS SHOWING THE BEST WAY
AND THE ANSWER IS A RESOUNDING YES
WE'RE NOT ASKING BRUSSELS FOR PERMISSION WE'RE NOT ASKING LONDON FOR PERMISSION WE JUST HAVE TO
AND WHAT THEY FOUND IS THE MOST EVIDENCE BASED STRATEGY THE MOST EFFECTIVE STRATEGY
HE HAS A WHOLE COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE ALL AROUND THE WORLD THAT EGG EACH OTHER ON TO BE HEALTHIER THROUGH TECHNOLOGY
GET TOGETHER GROUPS OF DOCTORS TO LEARN ABOUT FUNCTIONAL MEDICINE
SO AGAIN WE SEE THAT IT'S A COMMUNITY OF MICROBES AND NOT MEDICINE THAT CREATES HEALTH
YOU KNOW IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE 20TH CENTURY IT WAS ALL ABOUT OUR INTERACTION WITH GERMS
IN FACT THEY HAD LOWER LEVELS OF HEART DISEASE IN THE 1950S WHEN HEART DISEASE WAS ABSOLUTELY
AND SO THE OTHER THING THAT WAS SO IMPORTANT TO THEM WAS COMMUNITY
THE FUTURE OF MEDICINE ISN'T GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT'S DONE TO YOU AND YOU'RE JUST A PASSIVE PATIENT TAKING WHAT THE DOCTOR GIVES YOU
AND IT USES SYMPTOMS AS A WAY TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON AND THE ROOT CAUSE OF DYSFUNCTION
BUT THE MOST EXCITING THING AND WHAT COULD REALLY SCALE THIS UP IS TECHNOLOGY
NOW I WOULD BET THAT THE KIND OF PEOPLE THAT COME TO A TEDX EVENT LIKE THIS ARE THOSE PEOPLE WITHIN A
WHAT IS IT ABOUT COMMUNITY THAT YOU THINK IS SO POWERFUL
I WANTED TO REBEL
SO WHAT IS THIS NEW MODEL
AND FEEL THE POWER OF NEW COMMUNITY
SO MUCH SO THAT IT'S ALMOST A JOKE IN AMERICA NOW HOW PHARMACEUTICAL REPS COME AND TELL THE DOCTOR WHAT TO DO WITH EACH OF
THE FIRST PLACE THAT WE SEE THAT COMMUNITY AND NOT MEDICINE CREATES HEALTH IS THE BLUE ZONES
AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST BENEFICIARIES OF THAT IS COMMUNICATION
BUT IN FUNCTIONAL MEDICINE IT TURNS EVERYTHING ON ITS HEAD
THE BARBERS WERE NOT ONLY WILLING TO DO IT BUT THEY WERE DAMN GOOD AT IT
ELI SAUNDERS IN BALTIMORE AND DR
SO I RATHER CHEEKILY CREATED A ROLE FOR MYSELF
I SUPPOSE IT WAS ALL ABOUT MAKING THESE YOUNG PEOPLE MINI CELEBRITIES IN THEIR SCHOOL
BUT MAYBE THEY COULD SEE HOW MANY OTHER PASSIONATE PEOPLE THERE ARE IN SCHOOLS IN COMMUNITIES IN WORK PLACES THAT HAVE
DO A BIT OF RESEARCH AND MAYBE YOU'LL COME UP WITH THE ANSWER
NOW MY HEAD TEACHER WASN'T SO CONVINCED ABOUT THIS
I WANTED EVERY SINGLE CITIZEN TO KNOW THAT THEY SHOULD BE AN ACTIVE CITIZEN ONE THAT DOESN'T STAND
HOW ABOUT YOU COME TO IT
I KNEW THAT MY SCHOOL HAD TO MARK THIS
AND I ALSO SAID TO HIM LOOK JACK YOUR SCHOOL'S IN LONDON
STUDENT ANTI BULLYING COORDINATOR
I WOULD VISIT LOTS OF SCHOOLS AND I WOULD BE INSPIRED BY THE DIFFERENT IDEAS THAT YOUNG
WHAT AM I GOING TO ACHIEVE IN THOSE THREE YEARS THAT I CAN'T ACHIEVE NOW
I WANTED TO CREATE A TV ADVERT
I WANTED EVERYONE TO KNOW THAT THEY COULD PLAY A PART IN TACKLING BULLYING
AND IF WE CAN GET YOUNG PEOPLE DOING GOOD STUFF IN THEIR SCHOOL THEN THEY'RE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO GO OUT INTO THEIR COMMUNITY
AND IF YOU'RE SITTING THERE OR WATCHING THIS THINKING WHAT'S THE BIG SOCIETY
AND ON EVERY SMILE AND COMPLIMENT DAY 365 INDIVIDUALS WERE RECOGNIZED FOR THAT POSITIVE
HE WASN'T REALLY SURE WHERE THAT ALL CAME FROM AND WHAT IT MEANT AND I HAD TO CONVINCE HIM AND A LOT OF
BUT EVENTUALLY HE SAID TO ME
AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE COMMUNITY BEGINS THAT'S WHERE WE GET OUR SENSE OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A COMMUNITY WHERE WE CAN
I DIDN'T HEAR FROM JACK AFTER THAT
MY SCHOOL HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT
AND I CAN REMEMBER GOING HOME IN TEARS QUITE OFTEN
WELL YOU'VE GOT TO TELL SOMEONE
BUT I THINK WHATEVER HAPPENS I'M GOING TO CONTINUE DOING WHAT I'M DOING BECAUSE I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT THAT
I'M SURE WE'VE ALL HEARD THAT
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US CAN DO SOMETHING FOR SOMEONE ELSE
AND THIS IS IT
A FUN EXAMPLE BUT IT DOES ILLUSTRATE THREE THINGS IMPORTANT FOR ENCRYPTION
HOWEVER RAPID INCREASES IN COMPUTATIONAL POWER ARE PUTTING AT RISK A NUMBER OF THE KEY
EXCEPT THIS TIME INSTEAD OF A CALL TO GIVE JAMES THE CODE WE'RE GOING TO USE QUANTUM EFFECTS
MOSTLY WHAT YOU LEARN IN THE CLASSROOM IS MUCH MORE CONCEPTUAL OR MEANING BASED
LEARNING STYLES JUST ISN'T ONE OF THEM
BUT AT THE VERY LEAST WE CAN'T AFFORD TO BE WASTING OUR TIME AND RESOURCES TRYING TO PROMOTE LEARNING
IN OTHER WORDS THIS GAME BOARD WAS MORE MEANINGFUL TO THEM
MORE OFTEN THAN NOT THIS IS UNINTENTIONAL
THAT'S NOT EASY
OR HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO STUDY
OR WE DON'T REALLY THINK ABOUT ALL THE DREAMS WE'VE HAD THAT DON'T COME TRUE
WE HAVE TO MAKE CONNECTIONS TO IT CONNECTING IT TO OUR EXPERIENCES OR COMING UP WITH OUR OWN EXAMPLES OR THINKING
MORE OFTEN THAN NOT WE TRY TO PROVE OURSELVES RIGHT
BUT BY SAYING THAT LEARNING STYLES DON'T EXIST I'M NOT SAYING PEOPLE ARE THE SAME
AND THIS BASIC FINDING BY THE WAY HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO OTHER CONTEXTS EVERYTHING FROM CHESS TO BASKETBALL TO
WE LOOK FOR EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT WHATEVER IT IS WE THINK
THIS IS SUBCONSCIOUS
WE DON'T NOTICE ALL THE TIMES THAT WE'RE THINKING OF SOMEONE AND THEY DON'T CALL US
THIS WHOLE IDEA THAT LEARNING STYLES DON'T EXIST IN MANY WAYS SHOULD BE FURTHER GOOD NEWS BECAUSE IT MEANS ALL OF US ARE
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO BE RIGHT TO BE WRONG I SHOULD SAY
THEY COULD SEE THE STRATEGY INVOLVED
AND AS ABSURD AS THAT SOUNDS IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THE SAME PROBLEMS THE SAME CRITICISMS
WE NOTICE WHEN WE HAVE THAT MOMENT OF D J VU
THE FACT THAT LEARNING STYLES DON'T MATTER TO SOME EXTENT SHOULD BE A RELIEF BECAUSE IT'S ONE LESS THING TEACHERS HAVE TO
MANY OF YOU MIGHT SAY I'D PREFER TO SEE IT OR I'D PREFER TO HEAR IT OR I'D PREFER TO ACTUALLY DO IT
BUT AGAIN THE KEY IS WHEN PUT TO THE TEST THESE LEARNING STYLES DON'T EXIST IT DOESN'T MAKE A
I WILL SAY THAT WHEN WE SURVEY PEOPLE MANY PEOPLE SAY THEY HAVE PREFERENCES
SO IF I ASKED HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO LEARN SOMETHING
BUT AGAIN IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE'RE WILLING TO LET OUR GUARD DOWN SOMETIMES AND CHALLENGE OUR BELIEFS AND
WE NOTICE EVERY TIME WE'RE THINKING OF SOMEONE AND THEY CALL US BECAUSE IT'S A COOL COINCIDENCE IT'S KIND OF EXCITING
WHEN HIS GRANDMOTHER'S AWAY HE HAS SEX WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND ON HIS GRANDMA'S BED
SO WHAT WE CAN DO IS ACTUALLY BRING PEOPLE INTO THE LAB AND DISGUST THEM AND COMPARE THEM TO A CONTROL GROUP THAT HASN'T BEEN
THESE ARE THE SORTS OF THINGS IT MAKES SENSE FOR US TO STAY AWAY FROM BECAUSE THEY MIGHT ACTUALLY CONTAMINATE US
IN FACT JUST HAVING A DISEASED APPEARANCE OR ODD SEXUAL ACTS THESE THINGS ARE ALSO THINGS THAT
I THOUGHT HE MIGHT THROW UP ON ME ACTUALLY
AND YET THERE IS ANOTHER SENSE OF SPACE THAT WOMEN DO HAVE AND MEN DON'T
EQUAL BUT DIFFERENT
SENSE OF DIRECTION
WOMEN ARE SAID TO BE MUCH MORE EMOTIONAL THAN MEN AND BY THE WAY IN THE CONTEXT OF COMPANY
AND THAT'S THE SENSE OF DETAIL IN A SMALLER SPACE
I WOULD NEVER AGREE TO THE IDEA OF A PREDETERMINATION OF FUNCTION BASED ON
THAT'S USUALLY WHAT PEOPLE TALK ABOUT
AND THEY'RE LESS POLITICAL MAYBE BECAUSE THEIR LIFE DOESN'T REVOLVE AROUND THEIR CAREER ONLY
EQUAL AND COMPLEMENTARY
AND EVEN IF SHE MANAGES TO HAVE BOTH AT THE SAME TIME SHE MIGHT NOT GET THE
THEY KNOW TIME RUNS FAST
WOMEN ARE SAID TO HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE OF DIRECTION
AND THE LAW IS SET MANY TIMES BECAUSE OF THE FIGHTS OF VERY COURAGEOUS WOMEN AND SOME
WE'RE NOW HAVING DEBATES ABOUT PERHAPS USING MORE LAND RESOURCES TO PRODUCE
SO AS I WENT INTO THAT FIELD AND BECAME A GENETICIST AND WORKED TO BETTER IMPROVE
TECHNOLOGY THAT IS PROVEN AND EFFECTIVE AND SAFE WE NOW ARE HAVING DEBATES ABOUT WALKING
WE HAVE TO HAVE EVERY BIT OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY APPLIED TO OUR FOOD SYSTEM AND WE HAVE TO PLANT FENCE ROW TO FENCE
AND I WANTED TO BE PART OF THE TEAM THAT WAS GOING TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM AND I WANTED TO BE PART OF THE TEAM THAT WAS GOING TO CREATE
EVERY INPUT EVERY RESOURCE AS MUCH WATER AS MUCH SOIL AS MUCH LAND AS WE POSSIBLY
WE KNOW THAT YES THEY DO
THAT HAS COLLAPSED THAT'S A PROFOUND CULTURAL CHANGE
INDEED WE COULD BE FORGIVEN FOR ASKING OURSELVES
I THINK IT'S SORT OF FUNNY IT'S ON THE SIBERIAN COAST MAYBE THE RUSSIANS WILL CHARGE TOLLS
BUT WHEN IT GETS TOO HOT THE ALGAE CAN'T MAKE THE SUGAR
AND WHEN IT DIES IT FALLS TO THE BOTTOM AND THEN IT ROTS WHICH MEANS THAT
THE MILITARY OF THE ARCTIC NATIONS IS TAKING IT REALLY SERIOUSLY
THE REALLY SCARY THINGS THOUGH ARE THE PHYSICAL CHEMICAL
THEN YOU SURE WON'T WANT TO EAT FISH THAT WERE RAISED IN IT BECAUSE IT WOULD BE A KIND OF GASTRONOMIC
I MEAN BECAUSE WE AT THIS POINT WE CAN PROTECT IT
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE FISH IT'S NOT ABOUT THE POLLUTION IT'S NOT ABOUT THE CLIMATE CHANGE
AND THE ONLY FISHERY LEFT AND IT IS A COMMERCIAL FISHERY IS THE JELLYFISH FISHERY YOU SEE ON
COD FED MOST OF THE PEOPLE OF WESTERN EUROPE
AND THAT'S EVERYWHERE
INDUSTRIAL FISHING USES BIG STUFF BIG MACHINERY
AND THROUGH THEIR STORY WE'LL SEE THAT PROFOUND CHANGE IS INDEED POSSIBLE
BEING BULLIED BY YOUR SCHOOLMATES IS BIOLOGICALLY AND FUNDAMENTALLY NO DIFFERENT THAN BEING HUMILIATED IN
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
YOU KNOW MAYBE IT WASN'T THE SAME AS WHAT WE ALL ENVISIONED BUT IT WAS HIS OWN ACCOMMODATION TOOL
I WANTED TO FIND OUT WHAT I WANTED TO DO WITH MY LIFE
I WAS BROUGHT TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND AT THE EMERGENCY ROOM MY PARENTS WERE TOLD BY THE DOCTORS TO START PREPARING FOR THE
WOULD YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS
IT SOUNDS A LOT WEIRDER WHEN I SAY THAT OUT LOUD
I COULD HAVE GONE IN ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AND OFTENTIMES I DID
AND SO I TOOK MY OWN ADVICE AND I STARTED SHARING IT WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND SAYING SOMETIMES SELF ACCOMMODATION
AT THE SAME TIME I BLOSSOMED
COLLEGE WAS A GAME CHANGER FOR ME
AND SO I TALKED TO MY FRIENDS AND I SAID IS THIS OKAY FOR ME TO DO
SO I STARTED WORKING FOR THIS NONPROFIT RESOURCE CENTER FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND I TOOK ONE INTERNSHIP
IT JUST WAS LIKE A TON OF BRICKS THAT WERE DROPPED ON MY CHEST
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WHERE TO GO
AND AT THE UNIVERSITY I DO DISABILITY SERVICES
AND I WORK WITH STUDENTS WHO ALSO HAVE DISABILITIES AND HELP THEM SET UP ACCOMMODATION PLANS SO THAT THEY CAN BE
AND MY MASTERPIECE IN MY LIFE IS ACTUALLY MY DEAFNESS
BUT THE BIGGER PRINCIPLE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING BEHIND STACK OVERFLOW I THINK IS INCREDIBLY EXCITING
I THINK TASKRABBIT AND OTHER EXAMPLES OF COLLABORATIVE CONSUMPTION ARE LIKE LEMONADE STANDS ON STEROIDS
PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO REALIZE THAT THE REPUTATION THEY GENERATE IN ONE PLACE HAS
THEY'RE JUST BRILLIANT
THEY'RE JUST BEING REINVENTED IN WAYS THAT ARE RELEVANT FOR THE FACEBOOK AGE
HOW DO WE MIMIC THE WAY TRUST IS BUILT FACE TO FACE ONLINE
JUST BECAUSE SEBASTIAN IS A WONDERFUL HOST DOES NOT MEAN THAT HE CAN ASSEMBLE IKEA FURNITURE
I'VE WITNESSED THIS MYSELF AS I RUN WORKSHOPS FOR PEOPLE FROM ALL DIFFERENT WALKS OF LIFE FROM
THE BRITISH RED CROSS GAVE COMICS A CHANCE AND SAW HOW THEY WERE ABLE TO CREATE A NEW STORY AND SPREAD THEIR
AND THAT IS HOW I FOUND MYSELF IN APRIL SITTING IN THE OFFICES OF THE BRITISH RED CROSS ON A
5 OF TRADITIONAL TEXT BASED BOOKS IN THE UK ARE ACTUALLY
REPEATEDLY EVEN COLONEL GADDAFI CREATED A PROPAGANDA BIOGRAPHY
THIS REFUGEE WAS ONE OF THE 1000 REFUGEES UNDER THE AGE OF 18 WHO ARRIVE IN THE
IT WAS EVEN SPOTTED BEING READ BY HOME OFFICE DELEGATES ON A PLANE FOLLOWING A CONFERENCE
IT WAS PICKED UP IN SOCIAL MEDIA AND TWEETED ABOUT BY THE LIKES OF NEIL GAIMAN SIMON PEGG
AND IT IS MY HOPE THAT MORE PEOPLE WILL START TO TAKE THE MEDIUM OF COMICS MORE SERIOUSLY
I WAS TO BE HONEST FAIRLY WEARY AND NERVOUS ABOUT MEETING EBRAHIM
I WAS INVITED ALONGSIDE SEVERAL DIFFERENT COMIC ARTISTS FROM ALL OVER EUROPE FROM
WHEN I WAS A CHILD I WOULD SIT ON THE FLOOR LIKE I AM SURE MANY OF YOU HAVE SURROUNDED BY
THERE IS SOMETHING INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ABOUT TELLING STORIES IN PICTURES ABOUT
I THINK THAT IT'S THIS KIND OF PRIMITIVE AND PRIMAL NATURE OF VISUAL STORYTELLING WHICH HAS CAUSED
IT'S LIKE OK IT WAS CUTE IN THE BEGINNING BUT NOW IT'S NOT
IT CAN BE HAPPY
A CYCLE OF ENCOURAGING OTHERS TO BE HAPPY TO SPREAD THAT HAPPINESS BECAUSE ONE PERSON IS ALL THAT
THE CSF FILLS THE SPACE THAT SURROUNDS THE BRAIN AND WASTES FROM INSIDE THE BRAIN MAKE THEIR WAY
MY IPOD'S FULL OF THEM
YOU SEE THE MIDDLE CLASS GROW
A BIT DANGEROUS SOMETIMES
PERHAPS AFRICA CAN AVOID SOME OF THE MISTAKES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE
YOU CAN GO AND BUY SOME OF THE GREAT TUNES
AND SO DOES THE TECHNOLOGY
BUT YOU KNOW TECHNOLOGY
THEY'RE SHARING SOUND
ALL RIGHT I KNOW THAT THE INTERNET AND TELEPHONE TECHNOLOGY PROBABLY HAVE US MORE CONNECTED THAN WE EVER HAVE
AND IT'S ALSO AN ANCIENT QUESTION
WE COULD GET IT ANYWHERE ANYTIME
ALONE OR APART
IT'S A PERFORMANCE RIGHT
THERE ARE TWO WORDS
IN 1994 WHICH WAS THE YEAR THAT I WAS 13 YEARS OLD AND FIGURED OUT I WAS GAY
BUT IT WAS ALSO BECAUSE IT WAS SO DANGEROUS IT WAS SO RISKY IT WAS SO
IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S VERY UNDERGROUND
YOU COULD SAY
I BET MANY OF YOU HERE TODAY ARE ALREADY REDUCITARIANS
WE ALSO KNOW PERHAPS MOST MORALLY SALIENT THAT DUE TO FACTORY FARMING ANIMALS
SO WHATEVER IT IS ABOUT WORDS LIKE FLEXITARIAN AND VEGAN WE KNOW THEY CONJURE ENTIRELY
SOMETIMES I EAT MEAT AND SOMETIMES I DON'T
THAT IS A DOUBLE WHAMMY NO ONE WANTS TO EXPERIENCE WITH THEIR MORNING COFFEE
AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE THIS PERCENTAGE IS EVEN LOWER FOR VEGANS
ONCE IN A WHILE WE WOULD GO OUT TO EAT I'D ORDER BACON WITH MY EGGS AND PANCAKES AND THEY
BUT WHAT IS A PERSON WHO EATS LESS MEAT
I COULD DO A LOT MORE
WELL WE'VE ALL HAD THAT CONVERSATION BEFORE
WE ALSO KNOW THAT MEAT PRODUCTION REQUIRES A LOT OF WATER
THE DAY AFTER WHEN REALLY IT BECAME A LOT OF TALKING I SAID TO MYSELF AND MY WIFE SAID TO ME
AT SOME POINT HE JUST SAID 40 MILLION PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SEE YOU TODAY
WE WENT TO SOME LIVE FIGHTS
AND HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE WORKING TOWARDS A DREAM
YOU CAN COUNT THEM ON YOUR HANDS
BUT ACTUALLY IF WE START THINKING ABOUT THE WAY LOVE IS LIVED AND PERCEIVED BY INDIVIDUALS
BUT IN CHINA THERE'S A SENTENCE THERE'S A PHRASE IT'S PINYIN
THAT MEANS THAT WHEN I REMEMBERED WORDS I STARTED TO REMEMBER HOW THEY LOOKED ON THE PAGE
LET'S TAKE AN EXAMPLE IN THE 60'S A CHINESE RESEARCH TEAM DEVELOPED A
I'VE ACTUALLY WITNESSED THIS WITH A MIDDLE AGED COUPLE AND THEY DIDN'T SPEAK TO EACH OTHER AFTER THEY GOT ANGRY WITH EACH
THIS IS RELEVANT BECAUSE OUR IDEA OF ROMANTIC LOVE IS ACTUALLY THE OPPOSITE IT'S SOMETHING WHICH IS SPECIAL IN THE
I WILL PAY I WILL PAY BECAUSE FOR EVERYONE BECAUSE I KNOW THAT NEXT TIME SOMEONE ELSE WILL
NOW YOU MAY THINK THIS IS OF NO INTEREST AND IT'S LIKE BANAL BUT ACTUALLY IT INSCRIBES THE
THIS IS SOMETHING I COULDN'T DO BEFORE
SO THE SENTENCE GOES SOMETHING LIKE THIS
BASICALLY IN MY HEART I'M THINKING OF A PERSON I'VE MISSED THIS PERSON
I STARTED TO GET A PHOTOGRAPHIC MEMORY
SO LET ME TELL YOU HOW WE DO THIS
FOR SOME PATIENTS THIS HUNDRED DAYS MEANS THE MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH
IN FACT WE LIE AT THE INTERSECTION OF THE THREE OF THE MOST EXCITING DEVELOPMENTS WITHIN CANCER RESEARCH
LET ME WALK YOU THROUGH AN EXAMPLE OF ONE PATIENT
THE KEY THEN IS TO SEE WHETHER WE'RE ABLE TO DETECT THESE RECURRENCES OF CANCERS EARLIER THAN WITH
WE WILL WIN THE WAR ON CANCER
WE THEN APPLY STATISTICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL METHODS TO BE ABLE TO FIND THE SMALL SIGNAL THAT'S PRESENT
SO INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR CANCERS TO BE LARGE ENOUGH TO CAUSE SYMPTOMS OR FOR THEM TO BE DENSE ENOUGH TO SHOW UP ON
MANY OF US HAVE LOST FAMILY FRIENDS OR LOVED ONES TO THIS HORRIBLE DISEASE
TODAY OVER 600 CLINICAL TRIALS ARE OPEN ACTIVELY RECRUITING PATIENTS TO EXPLORE ALL ASPECTS
SO THEN THE QUESTION IS WHAT DO WE DO WITH THIS INFORMATION
HE CHERISHED THIS A LOT
BUT HE CAN'T PAY HIS FINES AND FEES BECAUSE HE HAS NOTHING TO GIVE
AND AT THAT POINT THEY'D THINK OK IT'S UNLIKELY THIS PERSON CAN COME UP WITH THE MONEY IT'S MORE LIKELY THIS NEW PERSON WILL
HE WAS HAPPY TO SHOW IT TO ME
SO THEY CALLED THE PARAMEDICS AND THE PARAMEDICS WENT TO THE CELL
THIRTY PERCENT OF WOMEN IN OUR LOCAL JAILS HAVE SERIOUS MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS JUST LIKE HERS BUT ONLY ONE IN SIX
WHEN I MET HIM IN HIS APARTMENT HE HAD NOTHING OF VALUE THERE NOT EVEN FOOD IN HIS FRIDGE
WELL ONE THING THAT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN UNDER THE LAW IS YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ARRESTED AND JAILED SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU
IN FACT THE WHOLE CELL WAS NEVER CLEANED SO THE FLOOR AND THE WALLS WERE LINED WITH BLOOD AND MUCUS
BUT IF IT WASN'T YOU'D STAY THERE FOR DAYS OR WEEKS AND EVERY DAY THE GUARDS WOULD COME DOWN TO THE CELLS
IT'S MAGICAL THING
IF IT'S A BAD ENOUGH VIRUS THE HEALTH OF YOUR HERD MAY BE GONE IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE
LAST YEAR HE TRAVELED TO SIERRA LEONE
OUR GOAL WAS TO BRING DNA SCIENCE TO MORE PEOPLE IN NEW PLACES
AND IT'S A RARE FUNGUS
PICTURE THAT YOU'RE SEEING 15 SUNSETS AND SUNRISES EVERY DAY
THE RIPPLES OF THE PERSONAL DNA REVOLUTION MAY BE HARD TO PREDICT BUT ONE THING IS CERTAIN
WELL TO ME IT SIGNALS SOMETHING BIGGER THAT DNA TECHNOLOGY IS FINALLY WITHIN THE REACH
AND IT'S AT TIMES LIKE THIS THAT PROFOUND TRANSFORMATION IS BOUND TO HAPPEN MOMENTS WHEN A
WE STARTED WORKING IN OUR BASEMENTS
TODAY FARMERS CAN TAKE THOSE SAMPLES THEMSELVES
EVEN BACTERIA AND SOME VIRUSES HAVE DNA TOO
YOUR ANIMALS ARE YOUR FAMILY'S SOLE SOURCE OF INCOME AS LONG AS THEY'RE HEALTHY
BUT NOT EVERYWHERE
SPECIES THAT DO NOT EVOLVE DIE
WE FEEL QUITE COMFORTABLE SAFE AND HAPPY
IS IT REALLY THAT SERIOUS
TURNS OUT THE GENTLEMAN IN THIS PICTURE IS A GUY NAMED JOE BEERY WHO WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE THE CIO OF A COMPANY CALLED LIFE
SO IT'S LIKELY I'M RELATED TO EVERY RESNICK THAT I EVER MEET BUT I DON'T KNOW
WELL EVERYBODY CAN THROW AROUND BIG NUMBERS
THE POST MODERN VERSION OF THE SHADOWS IN PLATO'S CAVE
AFTER A COUPLE OF WEEKS WHEN I FELT READY TO TEST MY PROGRESS I NOTICED THAT DESPITE THE TIME
FOR EXAMPLE PORNOGRAPHY LIMIT SEXUALITY TO A PASSIVE AND VOYEURISTIC PERSPECTIVE
HE SUBSCRIBED ME FOUR PILLS OF CIALIS WHICH IS AN ERECTION ENHANCING DRUG JUST LIKE VIAGRA IN ORDER TO
AND NOT ONLY DID I FIND OUT OR GOT AWARENESS FOR THE FACT THAT THE BRAIN IS ACTUALLY
COUNTLESS EXPERIENCES ONLINE AND FIRST STUDIES PAINT A DIFFERENT PICTURE WITH THE RESULT
AND THEN I SAID TO HER MOM YOU'VE BEEN A GOOD MOM TO ME AND MY BROTHER YOU'VE LOVED US YOU'VE LOVED
AND THIS HAPPENED OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN
AND THEN IF WE BALANCE OURSELVES IN THESE TWO DIMENSIONS WE'LL CREATE THE OPTIMUM ENVIRONMENT FOR OURSELVES AND EACH
THANK YOU STEEL MILL
THANK YOU POWER STATION
BECAUSE IT REMAINS HARD WORK FOR WOMEN TO WASH
AND THEN I PUT THE REALLY TOUGH QUESTION HOW MANY OF YOU HAND WASH YOUR JEANS AND YOUR BED
WHAT IS SPECIAL WITH THIS
THEY SAVE THE DAY
THERE'S SCIENCE BEHIND THIS TOO
IT'S STORIES LIKE THESE I WANT TO SEE MORE OF IN THE COMICS THAT WE'RE READING AND IN THE MOVIES THAT WE'RE WATCHING
BUT IF WE SEE TONY STARK REACHING OUT TO HIS FRIENDS ASKING FOR HELP FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE OR FIGHTING FOR WHAT HE BELIEVES
WHEN KIDS OR 21 YEAR OLD COLLEGE WOMEN ARE WATCHING COMIC BOOK MOVIES AND LOOKING FOR WHAT
THEY'RE NOT JUST ENTERTAINMENT
BUT I GO SEE SUPERHERO MOVIES FOR EXPLOSIONS AND HOT DUDES IN TIGHTS
7 AND HE WROTE 12 OF THEM IN TOTAL
WAS A COMPLETELY RANDOM PAPER
NOW IN REGARD TO THE CURRENT ECONOMIC CRISIS WE THINK THAT WE WILL JUST WAKE UP AGAIN
AND FOR ME IT'S VERY SHOCKING TO SEE SOMETIMES VERY POOR PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE NOT SUPPORTING THE IDEA
NOW WE DELIVERED THE CONFERENCE IN SUCH A WAY
THEY COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT SPEAKING FROM THE POSITION OF AUTHORITY LIKE TWO PROFESSORS WE
WE CAN CHOOSE TO HAVE DIFFERENT RATING AGENCIES
NOW WHEN WE ARE ANXIOUS OVER CHOICES SOMETIMES WE EASILY GIVE OUR POWER OF CHOICE AWAY
FIRST I REALIZED A LOT OF CHOICE I MAKE IS NOT RATIONAL
NOW YOU WILL BE SURPRISED THAT A MAJORITY OF OUR AUDIENCE DID NOT THINK THAT WHAT THEY'D
BUT WHAT YOU ARE BUYING NOW IS GREAT
NOW MANYA BECAME SO SUCCESSFUL IN SELLING CARS THAT SOON SHE MOVED ON TO SELLING AIRPLANES
ALSO WE ARE CHOOSING BY LOOKING AT WHAT OTHERS ARE CHOOSING
IT WOULD SERVE A COUNTRY
AND IT MIGHT JUST SEEM LIKE THAT JUST LIKE FICTION
IT COULD BE LET'S SAY FOR EXAMPLE A U
AS EACH BREAKDOWN POTENTIALLY EXPOSES IT TO MORE AND MORE OXYGEN
SOME PEOPLE FALSELY BELIEVE THAT OLIVE OIL ONLY COMES FROM A CERTAIN REGION
GOOD OLIVE OIL ONLY COMES FROM A CERTAIN REGION
NOW DON'T LET ALL OF THIS SCARE YOU AWAY FROM OLIVE OIL
IT STARTS WITH THE GROWING AND THE HARVESTING OF OLIVES AND IT INVOLVES EVERYTHING IT INVOLVES EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS TO THE
OLIVE OIL GROWN IN MANY PLACES AROUND THE WORLD
IF YOUR GENETICS IS THE HARDWARE YOUR EPIGENETICS IS THE SOFTWARE OR THE OPERATING
MOM'S CUDDLING THEM ALL THE TIME TYING THEIR SHOES DRIVING THEM TO SOCCER PRACTICE EVERY DAY
AND HE TRIED TO PERSUADE ME TO WRITE THE BROWSER FOR IT BECAUSE HIS SYSTEM DIDN'T HAVE ANY GRAPHICS OR FONTS OR LAYOUT OR ANYTHING IT
SO THAT PUTS ME IN PRETTY ILLUSTRIOUS COMPANY
ONE OF THEM WAS THE SKINNIEST HUMAN BEING SO I'VE EVER SEEN
THAT'S ABOUT THE SAME POPULATION AS THE ENTIRE STATE OF FLORIDA
SHE EXPLAINED IN THE BACK ROOM ON THE DIRT FLOOR WERE SEVEN CHILDREN
THEY WERE COMPLETELY FILTHY AND STARVING
5 EARTHS TO SUSTAIN THIS ECONOMY
WE CAN CHOOSE LIFE OVER FEAR
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT FEAR
THAT'S ALL TRUE
WE NEED IT TO DEVELOP TECHNOLOGY
AND THESE ARE NOT ESOTERIC LIMITS
SO THE THERAPIST SAID WE SHOULD DEVISE A SPLINT WHICH WOULD ROB MY KID OF THE ABILITY TO
AND I RECALL HOW BOLD AND HOPEFUL IT FELT EVEN AS SOME OF HER THERAPISTS SAID THAT
AT FIRST I THOUGHT SHE'D GOTTEN STUCK THERE BUT THEN I SAW HER REACHING FOR SOMETHING THAT HER EYE
AT FIVE MONTHS OLD SHE COULD NOT HOLD HER HEAD UP LIKE OTHER BABIES BUT SHE COULD HOLD THIS DEEP INTENT
I COULD RELEASE MY CULTURAL BIASES ABOUT WHAT MADE A LIFE GOOD OR BAD AND SIMPLY
IN 2012 A FAMOUS AMERICAN CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL INITIALLY DENIED AMELIA THE
AND SOMETIMES OUR MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS DECIDE WHAT LIVES ARE NOT WORTH LIVING
I STARTED SEEING THAT WHEN I RELEASED MY GRIP ABOUT WHAT MADE A LIFE GOOD OR BAD I COULD
THEY DIDN'T FOCUS ON ALL THAT WAS WRONG WITH MY KID
WE HAIL A BLOCKBUSTER FILM ABOUT A SUICIDAL WHEELCHAIR USER DESPITE THE FACT THAT ACTUAL WHEELCHAIR
I WAS REALLY HAPPY WHEN FIONA STARTED USING HER RIGHT HAND TO BULLY A DANGLING STUFFED SHEEP BUT
IT'S ABOUT HOW EAGER WE CAN BE TO LABEL A SITUATION TO PUT CONCRETE AROUND IT BY
THE PARABLE HAS BEEN MY WARNING THAT BY GRIPPING TIGHTLY TO THE STORY OF GOOD OR BAD I
SOME NEVER LEARN TO WALK OR TALK
AND SO WE DID EXACTLY THAT
WE HAD THOUSANDS OF CLICKS HUNDREDS OF E MAILS
HECK WE EVEN INVENTED THIS NEW MATERIAL FIRST BEFORE WE MADE THIS MESS SO
WE'VE SINCE GROWN THAT INITIATIVE AND WE'VE INCLUDED A HOTEL MANAGEMENT GROUP THAT HAS THREE HOTELS IN THE GREATER
THERE ARE CERTAIN ORGANIZATIONS IN DES MOINES THAT ARE DOING AN INCREDIBLE JOB MEETING THOSE NEEDS AND FOR US WE FEEL THE BEST
THIS IS ALL STARTED WITH A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE IOWA CUBS WHERE ON ROAD TRIPS THEY WOULD GATHER THEIR
AND WE BELIEVE IT CAN BE DONE AND I'M HERE TO INVITE YOU IN ON THIS
INFORMATION IS UP ON THE SCREEN
HOWEVER WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT INTRODUCING MORE HOMELESS SERVICES WILL LEAD US TO ENDING
THEN IF YOU LISTEN TO THE ENTIRE SENTENCE AGAIN IT WILL SOUND AS IF THE PERSON BURSTS INTO SONG
I WAS DEVASTATED
THAT I COULDN'T SEE TEN YEARS AGO
THAT'S WHAT I LEARNED THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS TO BE MUSICAL
CLASSICAL MUSICAL TRAINING FOLLOWS THE APPRENTICESHIP MODEL WHERE YOU STUDY WITH ONE OR TWO TEACHERS FOR MANY YEARS
SO I DEVELOPED A COURSE CALLED TRAINING THE MUSICAL BRAIN HOW TO USE NEUROSCIENCE TO DEVELOP MORE EFFECTIVE PRACTICE
HOW COULD THESE JUDGES GAUGE MY MUSICALITY
THE WAY THAT DOPAMINE'S AWASH IN THE BRAIN WHILE YOU'RE GETTING THE CHILLS FROM MUSIC IS VERY SPECIFIC TO WHEN AND WHERE IT
DOPAMINE DESPITE ITS WIDESPREAD FAME HAS ACTUALLY BEEN UNDERSOLD IN MANY WAYS PEOPLE THINK OF IT AS THE PLEASURE CHEMICAL
THOSE RATS WANTED NOTHING MORE THAN TO PRESS THAT LEVER
BUT THE MORE DESIRE THERE IS THE BETTER THE PLEASURE
YOU CAN THINK OF THE CAUDATE AS YOUR PARENT
BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH TO EXPLAIN A HUMAN OBSESSION
IT TURNS OUT THAT WHEN YOUR BRAIN IS ENJOYING A PIECE OF MUSIC THAT MIGHT EVEN GIVE YOU THE
BUT THE ONE THING THAT KEPT GNAWING AT ME OVER AND OVER AGAIN WAS HOW LITTLE NEUROSCIENCE HAD TRICKLED DOWN INTO THIS MODEL
FOOD WATER SEX
OUR MINDS HAVE EVOLVED IN SUCH A WAY THAT WHEN WE DON'T HAVE THOSE THINGS WE SEEK THEM OUT
SOUNDS CAN BE NOISE IN ONE CONTEXT AND MUSIC IN ANOTHER
THAT'S WHAT SHE DOES FOR A LIVING SHE GIVES PLEASURE AND SHE GETS EXHAUSTED BY THE PARTY BUT AT THE PARTY SHE
WHEN WE'RE WELCOMED WHEN WE'RE LOVED OPENLY EASILY OUR TRUST GROWS OFF OF THAT
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT COMPUTERS ARE GOING TO BECOME SUPER BRILLIANT AND TURN US
DESPITE THE EXTRAORDINARY THINGS I WAS SHOOTING AND EXPERIENCING THEY'D STARTED TO FEEL A LITTLE BIT ORDINARY TO ME
AND THIS ONE IS MY FAVORITE
HOW CAN WE GO WITH THIS ENERGY
SO HERE WE ARE
AND I WAS UPSTAIRS
AND THINKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN ENCOURAGE THEM TO DEVELOP THEIR IDEAS STAY CURIOUS
WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS THEY'RE CREATING A SHARED SPACE
THEY'VE EXPLORED IT IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS
WELL IT'S WHAT WE ARE TAUGHT TO DO
BUT WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM
WELL WHY WOULD I BOTHER DOING THAT
1 SECOND IT BECOMES MORE TICKLISH
IT'S TIME TO GIVE THEM SOME COMPANY
BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO ASK THE QUESTION WHO IS CULTIVATING THE ECONOMIC SOIL OF A COUNTRY
INCRA WOULD NOT ONLY RELEASE ITS RATINGS BUT IT WOULD ALSO RELEASE ITS INDICATORS AND
IF OVER 70 PERCENT OF A COUNTRY'S POPULATION UNDER THE AGE OF 35 IS
AND THAT IS THE REASON WHY I BELIEVE THEY SHOULD BE DEFINED AS PUBLIC GOODS
THERE IS NO INCENTIVE TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF YOUR PRODUCT
THE ENDOWMENT WOULD CREATE INCOME THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO RUN THE OPERATION TO RUN THE RATING
COMPARE YOUR THUMB TO THOSE AROUND YOU
AND BEING FROM THE US DOES NOT EXPLAIN WHAT SHE EXPERIENCED HERE
WE MADE THIS UP
NOW MAYBE THIS IS BECAUSE RACE DOESN'T ACTUALLY MATTER IN NORWAY BUT I SUSPECT THAT'S NOT THE CASE UNFORTUNATELY
AND THIS IS A TERRIBLE LINGUISTIC EQUIVALENCY
IT IS WHAT WE CALLED SOCIALLY CONSTRUCTED
BUT THUMB BENDINESS OR HITCHHIKER THUMB IS ALSO DIFFERENT THAN THESE OTHER TRAITS AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE DON'T GIVE
MAYBE YOU WOULD INJURE YOURSELF DOING SO
TAKE A LOOK AT IT
HE USED THE BUSINESS CARD
THIS WAS A PROBLEM STUDENT THAT I WASN'T GETTING THROUGH TO
HE MAKES THE TELEPHONE CALL
AND I FIGURED WELL SO WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO ABOUT IT
I IT'S THE EGO
THE MOST PROFOUND HALLUCINOGEN
WE WOULD LEAVE
I WROTE IT THIS MORNING
WHY DID YOU JUST LAUGH
SO LET'S TRY AGAIN
I WANT TO TELL YOU FOUR JOKES TODAY
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE'RE ABOUT TO MAKE A LANDING ON THE WATER
HOW HARD A PROCESS IS THAT
BUT IT JUST REQUIRES NOW AN INVESTMENT OF RESOURCES AND TRANSFER OF EXPERTISE
AND THEY DO THAT FOR TWO REASONS
WELL I WAS WRONG
THE SOUNDSCAPE IS MADE UP OF THREE BASIC SOURCES
IN A MATTER OF SECONDS A SOUNDSCAPE REVEALS MUCH MORE INFORMATION FROM MANY PERSPECTIVES
SO WHEN WE WERE SURE THAT THE MONKEY HAD REACHED HIS PLATEAU OF SPONTANEOUS RECOVERY
HOW DID IT HAPPEN
TRISTAN A WEST POINT TRACK STAR WHO ALWAYS RAN AND ROAD MARCHED WITH NO SOCKS
THEY HAD SEEN BUREAUCRATS DO THAT THEY HAD SEEN RICH LANDLORDS DO THIS
NOW NO ONE WOMAN COULD HANDLE PRODUCING 1000 BAGS A WEEK
IF WE HAVE CASH WE CAN HIDE IT IN OUR KITCHEN JARS
I AM BECAUSE WE ARE
THEY HAD NEVER SEEN POOR FARM WORKERS LET ALONE WOMEN FARM WORKERS SIT IN A POSTURE OF AUTHORITY AND IT
THE HIGHER COST OF SUSTAINABLE AND ETHICAL PRODUCTS IN THEIR BUDGET
THE FIRST OPTION IS TO STAY IN POVERTY THEY JUST STAY WHERE THEY ARE
THEY RESISTED THEY WEREN'T VERY HAPPY BUT IN TIME THE HUSBANDS HAVE
THEY'VE SHOWN US THAT THEY'VE MANAGED TO EASILY
AND WE SAID WHY DO YOU WANT TO DO THAT
THEY SAID BECAUSE OUR HUSBANDS WON'T SEE THE BANK STATEMENT LYING AROUND AND HE WON'T DEMAND THAT WE GIVE HIM
BUT IT'S BEEN A LONG CHALLENGE OF COURSE
I WAS THERE TO STUDY RURAL WOMEN AND WHAT KINDS OF RESOURCES THEY USED AND WHAT KINDS OF SUPPORT THEY NEEDED TO ESCAPE
THE THIRD PROBLEM THEY HAD
THE FIRST PART WAS IT WAS A NETWORK OF RURAL WORK SPACES WHERE
IT'S OFTEN CALLED THE THEORY OF MIND AND IT IS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO SHOW THAT ANIMALS HAVE SUCH A THING
EVERYONE WANTS TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES
I'VE LEARNED AS MUCH ABOUT IT AS I CAN
I MEAN WHAT'S THE POINT
WHO CARES WHY THINGS ARE CREEPY
THEY JUST ARE
1000 ADVERTISING MESSAGES A DAY YOU'RE EXPOSED TO
IF WE LEARN HOW THAT WORKS
WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THE MEDIA OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE DOING
I DON'T KNOW
BE A BIT MORE DOG
EVERYTHING ELSE WILL FALL INTO PLACE
WHERE WAS THE PRINTING PRESS
OF THAT 4 IS REMEMBERED POSITIVELY 7 IS REMEMBERED NEGATIVELY 89 ISN'T
DO YOU NOTICE ONE THING ON THERE THAT ISN'T CHANGING
HE CAN'T BREAK THE WINDOWS
THE NEIGHBOR CALLS THE POLICE THE POLICE CALL THE AMBULANCE THEY GET HIM OUT THE CAR
BUT THAT'S NOT THE QUESTION
THAT'S NOT MY JOB
IT IS AFTER ALL HARD TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING YOU CAN'T PUT INTO WORDS
NO WONDER NEWSPAPERS ARE DYING
THAT'S ONE OF THE ARCHAIC DUAL FORMS
WHO THEY WERE WE REALLY HAVE NO IDEA WE'RE NOT EVEN SURE WHERE THEY LIVED AND WHO THEY
THEY'RE PART OF THE SAME SOCIAL MECHANISM
IF HALF OF OUR ROVERS OR ROBOTS DON'T ARRIVE WELL IT WILL TAKE A BIT LONGER BUT YOU WILL STILL BE ABLE TO
WHERE ARE WE GOING TO GET THIS MATERIAL FROM
BUT HOW ARE WE GOING TO BUILD WITH IT
WHAT DO WE DO
EXOPLANETS ARE SO SMALL AND SO FAINT AND SO LESS MASSIVE THAN THEIR BRIGHT ADJACENT HOST STAR
SO WHAT WE WOULD DO IS WE'D NEED TO ANALYZE LIGHT IN MORE DETAIL AND LET ME EXPLAIN THAT BY THIS PICTURE OF A
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS HAPPENS TO ANYBODY HERE BUT SOMEONE HAS USUALLY A VERY
WE DIDN'T SET OUT TO MAKE GPS SO THAT WE CAN ALL FIGURE OUT HOW TO NAVIGATE
AND SO WHEN WE LOOK FOR ANOTHER EARTH WHEN WE ARE ABLE TO LOOK AT SPECTRA OF OTHER PLANETS WE'D LIKE TO SEE
AND ACTUALLY ALL LIFE ON EARTH REQUIRES LIQUID WATER
AND WHAT MY TEAM FOUND WAS THAT SOME OF THESE THAT ARE NOT PRODUCED BY LIFE FALL INTO VERY
IT'S VERY HARD TO THINK THAT DEEPLY THAT OUTSIDE OF THE BOX
AND THAT'S WHAT I AND OTHERS ARE AIMING TO DO FOR PLANETS FAR AWAY AROUND OTHER STARS
ASTRONOMERS HAVE FOUND THAT EACH STAR IN OUR SKY HAS AT LEAST ONE PLANET
THIS IS A REAL IMAGE OF EARTH
S DOESN'T WANT TO DO AS MUCH AS THEY HAVE HISTORICALLY
THE JAPANESE AREN'T GOING TO DO IT
AND THAT WAS THE ORDER YOU CAN CALL IT A G 7 OR A G 20 BUT IN REALITY WAS A G 1 PLUS
THEY HAD THE FUKUSHIMA CRISIS
WE STOP DOING GLOBAL WHEN GLOBAL DOESN'T WORK
NO IT MEANS THEY HAVEN'T DONE THIS BEFORE
HOW SHOULD WE HANDLE NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION
JAPAN AUSTRALIA SINGAPORE
IT IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES IN THE WORLD TODAY
THAT IS THE REASON NUMBER TWO
HOW ARE THEY DIFFERENT
THE FIRST IS THAT THE U
WE LIVE IN WHAT I CALL A G 0 WORLD NOT A G 7 NOT A G 20
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'M GOING TO DO
I'M GOING TO CHANGE MY MIND I WILL SUPPORT ANYTHING YOU WANT TO DO IN THE SECURITY COUNCIL
SHE GREW UP IN NAZI GERMANY IN THE 30S AND THE 40S
SO I BECAME VEGAN
IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO CARE ABOUT SOMEBODY IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND THEM
FIRST NAME LAST NAME MR
AND HE SAID SURE
RED BLACK RED FASTER BLACK BLACK BLACK RED THROUGH THE WHOLE DECK BLACK BLACK RED EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM
BUT I ALWAYS STRUGGLED TO MAINTAIN THEM
LAST NIGHT I HAD THE STRANGEST DREAM I'VE EVER DREAMED BEFORE
SHE HAD THE BEST DEFINITION THAT I RESONATED WITH
WE WERE IN ANTICIPATION OF THE ED SULLIVAN SHOW
EVERYTHING IN OUR LIFE
I GET INTO THE AIRCRAFT JOIN MY FELLOW PASSENGERS
AND THEY'LL HAVE AROUND THE WALLS SOME SMART BOARDS SO THAT THERE THEY CAN SEE THE PROGRESS THEY MAKE
SO DESIGNERS NEED TO BE ALL OVER THIS PROCESS
NOW THIS VEHICLE IS AN OBJECT LESSON IN BEING THE RIGHT TOOL FOR THE JOB
WHAT'S THE SMALLEST THING WE CAN DO TO MAKE THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE
WE'VE GOT MAGIC BREAKFAST 365
FIRST OF ALL THE TESCO PEOPLE THOUGHT I HAD THE BIGGEST CARB HABIT IN THE WORLD
WE ALSO WANT TO TACKLE HOLIDAY HUNGER
SOMETIMES THEY GIVE US SOMETHING AND SOMETIMES THEY DON'T
ABOUT 15 YEARS AGO I WAS WRITING A BOOK CALLED CHANGE ACTIVIST
HAS THIS MADE ANY DIFFERENCE AT ALL
SO I WAS REJECTED
AND I CHOOSE AGAIN OFTEN
GO AHEAD AND ADJUST YOUR SAILS
I COULDN'T DO THAT ANYMORE
I HAD WONDERFUL PEOPLE IN MY LIFE WHO CAME
TODAY IS TODAY AND I'M GLAD IT'S TODAY
THESE KINDS OF LOSSES ARE OUT OF OUR CONTROL
THIS LIGHTS THE BRAIN UP
I'M GOING TO GIVE UP
THERE ARE REAL CONCERNS THERE
WE CAN USE CALCULATED RANDOMNESS
NO WE WANT ONE OR TWO MONSTERS ON THE SCREEN AT ANY ONE TIME
AND SO THESE COMBINE TO FORM A VERY INTENSE EMOTIONAL ENGAGEMENT
THAT WOULD BE VERY BORING
WE ALSO SAY THERE'S GOING TO BE LOADS OF OTHER ITEMS OF VARYING QUALITIES AND LEVELS OF EXCITEMENT
DO THEY THINK DO THEY FEEL AND IF SO HOW
ALL NON RELIGIOUS WARS
THAT WAS WHAT WAS IMPORTANT
I RARELY HAVE TO SOLVE PROBLEMS BY MYSELF
PEOPLE ARE THROWING OUT IDEAS
PEOPLE GO TO PARKS THEY BRING FOOD WITH THEM TO THE PARK AND HAVE A PICNIC
THEY WERE HOPING AND PRAYING
THE BIGGEST ONE WAS THAT THE CO2 LEVEL INSIDE THE CAPSULE BEGAN TO INCREASE
ACTUALLY MAYBE PEOPLE COULD SING
WE WANT NEW IDEAS
LET'S FIGURE OUT WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE
HE PUT THE US REPUTATION ON THE LINE
I DON'T THINK ANYONE CARED
THEY HAD A DEADLINE
IT'S KIND OF LIKE AN INDOOR PICNIC
MAYBE THE WAITERS COULD SING
WE'RE VERY SIMILAR IN LOTS OF WAYS
WE HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS SOMETIMES
WE'RE GOING TO TALK IT THROUGH
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THAT ACTUALLY DID EXIST
AND I WAS LIKE WELL NO
THEY HAD A DEADLINE THAT INVOLVED ACTUAL DEATH
I RARELY WORK ALONE
I AM A BIT OF A SCIENCE NERD SO I DON'T MIND TALKING ABOUT THIS STUFF
HOW ARE WE GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
WHAT RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE
WHAT TIME IS AVAILABLE
I WORK WITH A TEAM
IT'S KIND OF INTERESTING
WHY NOT CREATE YOUR OWN FILM FESTIVAL
THEY SAID THAT IF MY T A MARY' WHO WAS THE CULTURE MAVEN IN THE FAMILY WOULD TAKE ME
I ASKED HER AND SHE AGREED AND I WAS OFF TO MY FIRST NEW YORK FILM FESTIVAL
THEY MAKE FILMS LIKE THAT IN CUBA
EVERY SINGLE PERSON I'VE WORKED WITH HAS THE ABILITY IN THEIR OWN WAY TO BREAK THROUGH
IT BRINGS US ALL TOGETHER
EVERYONE WHO STUDIES PUBLIC SPEAKING PUTS THAT SPEECH IN THEIR LIST
THAT'S NOT WHAT GREAT SPEAKERS DO
THEY HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH
AND SHE WAS LIKE WHY
IT WAS GOING TO BE THE HIGHLIGHT OF OUR STORE
I WAS IN CHARGE OF THE FOUR YEAR OLDS WHICH IS GOOD BECAUSE FOUR YEAR OLDS CAN'T PLAY SPORTS AND
ADULTS CAN TOO AND WE GET THERE WHEN WE READ
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S ALMOST AS OLD AS STORYTELLING ITSELF
AND HERE'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE
I WOULD TELL THEM ABOUT HOW ON THE WEEKENDS I WOULD GO HOME AND I WOULD SPY FOR THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND
AND I SAID I'VE GOT POWERPOINT
I USED TO BE A SUMMER CAMP COUNSELOR
I WOULD DO IT ON MY SUMMERS OFF FROM COLLEGE AND I LOVED IT
THIS ONE THURSDAY AFTERNOON I WAS WALKING ACROSS CAMPUS WITH MY BOYFRIEND AND WE WERE DEBATING BACK AND FORTH ABOUT WHAT I SHOULD
SHE'S A REALLY SMART STUDENT ENGLISH LIT PROGRAM HONORS YOU KNOW THE TYPE
MY SPEECH WAS BROKEN INTO THREE SECTIONS
AND IT'S THE SYSTEM THAT JUST HAS TO CHANGE
IN AN OPEN SCIENCE WORLD IF CANADIAN SCIENTISTS WORK IN A CERTAIN AREA AND LET THE WORLD KNOW THEN OTHER PEOPLE AROUND THE
WE USE THE SAME INCENTIVE SYSTEM THE SAME SYSTEM OF SCIENCE AS ALL AROUND THE WORLD
WE NEED YOUR HELP
WE STILL REALLY DON'T HAVE AN IDEA ABOUT WHAT CAUSES IT
WE NEED TO REMEMBER WHAT PASTEUR SAID MORE THAN A CENTURY AGO
AND DOES IT DELIVER
AND THAT QUARTER OF A TRILLION DOLLARS I TOLD YOU ABOUT IF WE KEEP DIVIDING IT UP BY COUNTRY AND
ANY EXPERIMENT THAT'S BEEN DONE HERE IN CANADA IS LIKELY TAKING PLACE IN TEN OTHER PLACES AROUND THE WORLD AT
ACADEMICS HAVE USED OUR REAGENTS TO MAKE BREAKTHROUGH DISCOVERIES IN CANCERS THAT ARE
PROJECTS LIKE THE ALLAN INSTITUTE IN SEATTLE WHOSE MAPPING OF THE BRAIN IS BEING SHARED WITH THE
AND WHAT DOES IT SAY ABOUT ANY INDIVIDUAL LIKE ME
I'M AN IRRELEVANT COG IN THE MACHINE
AND MAYBE WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT MAKING SOME DISCOVERY THAT HELPS ONE OF THE WORLD'S BIG PROBLEMS LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE
AROUND THE WORLD WE'RE SPENDING ABOUT A QUARTER OF A TRILLION DOLLARS EVERY YEAR ON BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH A QUARTER
THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY
DO YOU REALIZE IT'S BEEN 200 YEARS SINCE PARKINSON DESCRIBED THE DISEASE NAMED AFTER HIM
I THOUGHT WHAT COULD I DO WITH THEM
YOU'RE VERY WELCOME TO TAKE THE PENS WITH YOU AND HAVE A PRACTICE AT HOME EVEN SHOW SOMEBODY ELSE
SO I SAID I WOULD AND I BOOKED THE TIME IN
I'LL DO MY CARTOON DRAWING
AT THE END OF IT I HAD A LOVELY EMAIL FROM DOCTOR MIKE JORDAN AND HE'S THE CHAIR OF THE TALK GROUP
IT WAS AN INSPIRATIONAL SESSION FOR ME
IF WE DID CHALLENGE THOSE BELIEFS AND THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT THEM APART FROM DRAWING WHAT ELSE WOULD BE
YOU CAN JUST SEE THE DELIGHT ON THEIR FACES CAN'T YOU
THEY JUST GOT ON WITH IT
HAVE YOU EVER DONE THAT
ALL WE'RE DOING IS LITTLE VARIATIONS
ONE IS HAVE AN OPEN MIND
ARE YOU UP FOR THAT
IT WOULD REALLY BOOST THE ECONOMY
I WAS COMING AT IT FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE WHERE I WAS BRINGING THAT DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE TO BEAR ON THE PROBLEM
IT GROUPS THEM
I TAKE THIS HAND AWAY
IN A MOMENT WHEN MY HAND MOVES FROM FACING YOU TO BEING AWAY FROM YOU THIS FINGER RIGHT HERE MY INDEX FINGER IS
AND THEN I OPEN MY HAND UP
BUT YOU CAN'T COUNT MY FINGERS RIGHT NOW CAN YOU
I'LL DO IT FOR YOU AND THEN I'LL EXPLAIN IT
YOU GIVE THE KNIFE OUT
IT'S A REALLY THIS GRAPH WELL I'LL SHOW IT TO YOU SOME OTHER TIME WHEN WE HAVE SLIDES
AND WE COULD TALK ABOUT WHY THIS IS DECEPTIVE WHY YOU DON'T NOTICE THERE ARE ONLY THREE FINGERS DOWN HERE BECAUSE
PEOPLE IN THE SATELLITE ROOM ARE STARTING TO MOVE IN NOW
I'LL GET MY SLEEVE BACK
I HOLD THE KNIFE IN MY HAND
SO ORIGINS ARE IMPORTANT
WE CAN'T SAY THEY'RE NOT IMPORTANT THEY ARE IMPORTANT IN OUR LIVES
RIGHT NOW THESE TWO EFFECTS THEY DON'T CANCEL OUT
AND AS A RESULT THERE ARE GAPS IN OUR KNOWLEDGE
CLOUDS ARE FORMED WHEN MICROSCOPIC WATER DROPLETS OR ICE CRYSTALS COALESCE
THAT SUNSHADE IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE POWERFUL
CLOUDS COULD HELP US OUT WITH GLOBAL WARMING
THAT IS A LOT OF WASTED SOLAR POWER
BUT I STILL GO TO WORK EVERY DAY
BUT WE DON'T WANT MODELS TO BE PERFECT
WELL TO A LARGE EXTENT IT'S BECAUSE THEY DON'T AGREE ON WHAT CLOUDS WILL DO IN THE FUTURE
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF SUPPLIERS IN THERE
BUT THERE ARE COMPANIES
THAT'S MY SIMPLE UNDERSTANDING OF HUMAN RIGHTS
THEY CAN BE PORTABLE
HE USED TO SAY WE ARE ALL GOING TO BE WALKING ON MOVING SANDS
AND I THINK MIX WE CAN
AND WHAT ABOUT MOTHERLAND
SO IT WAS THE LIQUID LANDS THAT NEEDED FEMINISM AND ACTIVISM AND HUMAN RIGHTS AND
IT'S CALLED SYNESTHESIA
AND THEY CAN DO IT FOR REALLY LONG TIME BEFORE THEY CAN FINALLY GET TO WHAT'S RIGHT ABOUT IT
MUST BE THERE FOR A REASON
WE'RE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE SOFT BEHAVIORAL THINGS
I THINK WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS WE HAVE TO APPROACH CHANGE IN A BRAND NEW WAY
I THINK IT'S GREAT TO QUESTION THINGS
ARE WE EMPOWERING PEOPLE
AND HE PUT A BANANA ON TOP OF THE CAGE
SUDDENLY HE GOT REALLY ENGAGED
AND THAT'S HOW CHANGE AND INNOVATION WILL REALLY HAPPEN
WHEN IS ABE LINCOLN'S BIRTHDAY
NOW THINK ABOUT IT
WE NEED TO KILL THINGS WE NEED TO ERADICATE THE STUFF THAT'S TOO COMPLEX THAT GETS IN OUR WAYS MEETINGS AND EMAILS SO WE CAN MAKE
GET TO THE ANSWER
HOW CAN WE ASK A BETTER QUESTION
THE DAY TO DAY STUFF YOU DO
THEY EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE THEIR TALENTS FROM ANYWHERE
I HAD TO BUILD MY DAILY HABITS FROM THE GROUND UP
I HAD TO LEARN TO GET VERY CLEAR ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT WAS WITHIN MY CONTROL AND DELIVER THAT
I'VE GOT TO GIVE A PRESENTATION TO THE BOARD THIS AFTERNOON AND I ONLY JUST FOUND OUT
AND I REMEMBER THINKING NO
I CAN'T DIE YET
HISTORY IS NOT MERELY THE PAST
WE CAN FIND EXAMPLES OF THIS IN ALMOST EVERY ASPECT OF JAPANESE CULTURE
TO REMINISCE AND TO IMAGINE THEMSELVES BACK IN TIME
THAT'S WHAT A GOOD CONCERT STILL DOES TODAY
I HOPE I'VE HELPED YOU TO APPRECIATE THAT
THE EXPOSURES ARE LONG
WE MUST IMAGINE OR LEARN WHERE WE ARE GOING AND MEANWHILE WE MUST BE FULLY
THOUGH THESE IMAGES LOOK HISTORICAL THEY ARE ACTUALLY CONTEMPORARY
OLD BUILDINGS STORING RICH MEMORIES ARE BEING DESTROYED
FORTUNATELY IT'S NOT THAT WAY EVERYWHERE IN JAPAN
I THINK MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT
THROW AWAY DEPRESSION FOR JUST A SECOND
NOW IT TURNS OUT SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE IN THE WORLD USE THESE THIRD PERSON PRONOUNS AT HIGH RATES AND OTHER PEOPLE
AND THE ANSWER IS YES
SO KEEPING A SECRET IT SEEMS IS SOMEHOW TOXIC
THESE ARE THE STUFF OF THOUGHT THESE WERE THE STUFF OF COMMUNICATION
AND IN FACT IF I TOOK THAT NOTE TO THIS AUTHOR NOW 6 MONTHS LATER AND SAY WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT THE AUTHOR WILL SAY NO IDEA
NOW I BELIEVE HIM
THAT IS ABOUT THREE AND A HALF BILLION U
THAT'S FOR LITTLE CHILDREN
I READ A LOT OF SPY NOVELS AND STUFF
WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITHIN JCC
WHAT ARE THE FIGURES HE'S RELYING ON
THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE IS THE NEXT TOWER OVER
DISCARD THE SECOND MYTH IT IS A BIG THING
IF IT IS I HAVE TO GO TO COURT PERSONALLY I WILL DO THAT
I'M ON A POINT
TT AND WE HAVE THE WE ARE THE LEADERS IN THE STRUGGLE TO PRODUCE A NEW PUBLIC PROCUREMENT SYSTEM ABOUT HOW
IT'S AN ECONOMIC CRIME
WE ARE BIG PEOPLE AND WE'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR SOCIETY
YOU SEE HISTORY'S RICH IN IRONY
THEY WENT RIGHT IN HERE
I WAS A YOUNG MAN AT THE TIME
IT'S A HUGE PROBLEM
WE ARE MUSIC ARCHIVISTS
WE ARE TASTEMAKERS AND CURATORS
RECORD DIGGING IS A LIFESTYLE
MY PARENTS USED TO GIVE ME MONEY TO EAT AND ON MOST DAYS INSTEAD OF EATING I WOULD SAVE IT AND BUY MYSELF A RECORD AT
AS A YOUNG MAN HE PLAYED AND TOURED WITH LIVE BANDS IN THE US AND IN EUROPE BUT HAD NEVER RECORDED AN ALBUM OR A
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME TO MENTION THESE ARE NOT MY ORIGINAL IDEAS I STAND ON THE SHOULDERS OF GIANTS
LEWIS WROTE ABOUT IT IN HIS BOOK THE FOUR LOVES
I HAD A CLIENT CHARGED WITH A SERIOUS ASSAULT
YOU WALK OUTSIDE BUT SOMETHING'S DIFFERENT
THEN I LOOKED AT THE PICTURES
FROM THERE IT RADIATED AROUND THE PACIFIC
ALTHOUGH IT DOES TAKE QUITE A LOT MORE TO KILL A PERSON THAN TO KILL A BUG
LET ME EXPLAIN
WE WILL GO ALL IN
WE ALSO HAVE A FOUNDATION THAT'S COMMITTED TO WORK THROUGH PARTNERS AND HELP IMPROVE THE LIVES AND PROTECT THE
IT'S REALLY DIRTY IN PRODUCTION
SO THINK ABOUT THAT
PROBABLY MANY PEOPLE ARE WEARING COTTON RIGHT NOW
SO LET'S TAKE AN EXAMPLE MEASURE THE THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT IN YOUR BUSINESS
THE ELECTRICITY IS FREE
AND WE'VE DECIDED IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS WE WILL DOUBLE THE VOLUME OF CERTIFIED MATERIAL WE PUT THROUGH OUR BUSINESS
FARMERS ARE COMING OUT OF POVERTY
ACTUALLY WE FOUND 100 PERCENT IS EASIER TO DO THAN 90 PERCENT OR 50 PERCENT
SO LEDS ARE FANTASTIC
CAN I PAY THE BILLS AT THE END OF THE MONTH
I WORKED ON DEVELOPMENT AND AGRICULTURE ISSUES IN THE U
THEY PRODUCED HEAT AND A LITTLE BIT OF LIGHT ON THE SIDE
YOU HAVE AN IDEA AND YOU SHARE IT WITH SOMEONE SOMEONE HAS AN IDEA AND THEY SHARE IT WITH YOU YOU SHARE IT WITH OTHER PEOPLE IT GETS BOUNCED AROUND
SHE CAN OPEN A CAN OF SODA SHE CAN SHE HAS MANY TALENTS SHE CAN CHUG THE CAN OF SODA AND THEN SHE CAN
ELIOT IS NOT AS YOU MAY THINK ROLLING OVER IN HIS GRAVE THAT I'M UP HERE FROM MTV ON THE TED
MAYBE THEY WANT TO KEEP GROWING BUT MAN S TOO IGNORANT TO STOP MOWING SO LAWNS ARE CUT EACH
WELL CLOSE UP ON AN EMOTION ON A CHARACTER'S FACE THE PROTAGONIST BEGIN TO PULL BACK AS THE MUSIC
OR PUT A POEM UP ON THE SCREEN AND HAVE US TRANSLATE IT ONLY PROBLEM IS THE POEM WOULD BE IN A LANGUAGE
EVERYONE HAS A SMARTPHONE AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS REMIXING MASHING UP AND THEN SPITTING BACK
YOU CAN'T INNOVATE TOP DOWN
THAT'S UP 14 FROM LAST YEAR SAME TIME PERIOD AND WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO HAVING
THESE FOLKS WERE NOT CHASING A GRANT OR MONEY
THEY'VE DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB
PRETTY AMAZING STUFF
SAFETY THINK ABOUT THIS ONE
MORE AND MORE EDUCATION IS GOING TO BE SELF DIRECTED
MY DAD HAD A PHRASE NOT ORIGINAL WITH HIM
A NEW MODEL FOR INNOVATION
I WON'T GO THROUGH THE WHOLE LIST ON THIS
I SERVED SIX YEARS IN THAT JOB
AND WHERE ARE WE
WE HAVE THE FASTEST GROWING CITY IN THE UNITED STATES WHEN IT COMES TO METROPOLITAN AREAS
I WAS LITERALLY TOO TIRED TO DO ANYTHING ELSE
THOSE THREE THINGS ARE LIKE I SAID IT'S ALL IN YOUR MIND GET OVER IT YOGA AND
OF COURSE THEY HAVE AND I'M AMAZINGLY APPRECIATIVE OF THAT ABSOLUTELY
I'M MASSIVELY OVERSIMPLIFYING HERE BUT THE WAY A GOOD DOCTOR WOULD DIAGNOSE
YOU ALL NEED TO APPRECIATE THEM MORE
IS THERE MORE THEY COULD HAVE DONE
I GOT ILL ONE DAY
BUT THIS SCHOOL'S DONE A LOT FOR ME
MY ROUTINE WAS LITERALLY WAKE UP AT 1 P
I'M OBSESSED WITH CLOUDS
HOW DO YOU GET BETTER
I HAVE KNOWN PEOPLE GO MONTHS OR YEARS WITHOUT A DIAGNOSIS
SERIOUSLY CLOUDS ARE BEAUTIFUL
THE NEXT POSITIVE I FOUND IS I'VE REALIZED JUST HOW LUCKY I AM
THEY DON'T WORK
EVEN THIS SCHOOL YOU KNOW
BUT HAVE THEY DONE A LOT ANYWAY
THAT'S NOT AN EXAGGERATION
ALL OF YOUR FRIENDS ARE RUNNING ABOUT LIVING THEIR OWN LIVES DOING THEIR OWN THINGS AND YOU CAN'T INTERACT WITH THEM YOU'RE TRAPPED
EVERYTHING'S MOVING SO FAST AND YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT
I SHARE THIS STORY WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH CFS
THAT'S HUGE THAT'S AMAZING
WHAT IS MINE TO DO
I FEEL COMPELLED TO DO SO
THEY HOLD OUR WISDOM AND OUR EXPERIENCE
IT S THE TIME WHEN WE ALL HAVE THAT SENSE
1948 THE COMMUNIST PARTY WAS THERE
AND EVEN MORE THAN THAT
AND QUESTION WHAT S ALREADY IN THERE
TAKE BACK THE POWER OF YOUR STORY AND THE OTHER SIDE SAYS
IF YOU RE HUMAN YOU ARE A STORYTELLER SO NOW IS A GOOD TIME TO GET GOOD AT IT
AND LAST MY TIP FOR YOU IS TO ASK YOURSELF THE QUESTION
AND I TOLD THEM ALL AS WELL
THAT S WHAT I THINK A STORY ACTIVIST IS AND THAT S WHAT I THOUGHT I WAS DOING WHEN THE GIZ HERE IN GERMANY INVITED ME TO
SO WHAT STORY ARE WE LIVING IN RIGHT NOW
HOW DO WE CHANGE THIS
COULD I CALL YOU BACK
HOW DO WE CLOSE THAT GAP THAT I DESCRIBED BETWEEN THE
AND SO WE HAVE TALKED TO THE WRITERS GUILD IN HOLLYWOOD AND GUESS WHAT
AND WE NOW KNOW FROM BACTERIA TO PLANTS TO ANIMALS TO HUMANS WE ALL
AND THE STRATEGY THERE WAS TO FOLLOW THE LIGHT
IT'S AN OBJECT THAT BEHAVES LIKE A WAVE SO THAT IT DOESN'T JUST MOVE IN ONE DIRECTION OR THE OTHER
AND IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A MYSTERY HOW THEY DO THIS
NOW THE EARTH'S MAGNETIC FIELD IS VERY VERY WEAK IT'S 100 TIMES WEAKER THAN A FRIDGE MAGNET AND YET IT AFFECTS
QUANTUM COHERENCE IS THE IDEA OF QUANTUM ENTITIES MULTITASKING
THAT'S A GOOD THING
BUT IN EVERYDAY LIFE WE CAN FORGET ABOUT IT
SO SCHR DINGER SPECULATED THAT MAYBE QUANTUM MECHANICS PLAYS A ROLE IN LIFE
BECAUSE THE THING YOU HAVE IN YOUR HAND IS WHAT YOU CAN MAKE INFLUENCE WITH
I SPENT ALL THIS TIME SEVEN YEARS TO THAT POINT DOING SOMETHING THAT I LOVED DOING SOMETHING THAT I
YES YOU CAN BE THAT GUY DOING THAT THING MAKING THIS MONEY BUT WHAT DO YOU ACTUALLY
AT THE AGE OF 11 I WAS COMPETING AT THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP
I WAS CRYING PROBABLY CUSSING AT EVERYBODY AROUND
I WAS JUST MAD YOU KNOW
MY NAME IS DEBRA BROWN
I'M FROM PITTSBURGH PENNSYLVANIA
COULD IT BE BAD NEWS FROM THE TAX OFFICE
DON'T THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU STILL WANT TO DO THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
I CHOOSE NOT TO IGNORE THE ENVELOPES ANYMORE
IT'S THIS DEMOCRATIZATION OF INFORMATION THAT I THINK IS AN INFORMATION ENLIGHTENMENT AND IT HAS MANY OF THE SAME
THEY DON'T HAVE SPECIAL POWERS
IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT
HE THREW IT ALL OUT THERE
YOU'VE GOT DRONES NOW BEING CONSIDERED FOR DOMESTIC SURVEILLANCE
I THOUGHT IT ALWAYS STICKS TOGETHER
TAKE IT ON FAITH
THAT'S WHY WE'RE STARTING TO SEE MORE DISCLOSURE LAWS COME OUT SO FOR EXAMPLE ON THE ENVIRONMENT THERE'S THE AARHUS CONVENTION
THEY ALL BITCHED ABOUT EACH OTHER
DO YOU KNOW THE ONE I MEAN
HE WASN'T CONTENT WITH THE WAY THE NEWSPAPERS PUBLISHED IT TO BE SAFE AND LEGAL
THAT DID END UP WITH VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN AFGHANISTAN BEING EXPOSED
WE HAVE AN OFFICIAL SECRETS ACT WITH NO PUBLIC INTEREST TEST
THEY'RE NOT MAGIC
IT WAS AMAZING
I MEAN IT WAS AMAZING
I WANT TO SEE THE EVIDENCE BEHIND WHY THAT'S SO
I MEAN THERE DEFINITELY IS PROGRESS ON THE LINE BUT I THINK WHAT WE FIND IS THAT THE CLOSER THAT WE GET RIGHT
WHAT THEY HADN'T COUNTED ON WAS DIGITIZATION BECAUSE THAT MEANT THAT ALL THOSE PAPER RECEIPTS HAD BEEN
AND SO SHE SET ABOUT TO MAKE IT SO
THAT WAS NOT MY INTENTION
AND I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU I WASN'T THAT HOPEFUL BECAUSE I'D SEEN THE ESTABLISHMENT
SKEPTICISM BECAUSE YOU MUST ALWAYS BE CHALLENGING
AND WE ARE CONVINCED THAT REAL CHANGES IN OUR SOCIETY ARE ONLY POSSIBLE WITH THE
SO FROM TURKEY TO THE GREEK ISLANDS
AND IT'S ESSENTIAL ALWAYS TO KEEP IN MIND THIS OVERALL AIM THAT UNIFIES YOU WITH PERSONS ALL OVER YOUR COUNTRY
AND THIS IS SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF COURSE DAILY WORK ISN'T ALWAYS THE MOST PASSIONATE OR THE MOST
THEN THEY ATTACKED GAY PEOPLE
DON'T SHY AWAY FROM PHRASES LIKE MORAL OBLIGATION
THEY COULD GO ACTUALLY UNDERNEATH YOUR DESKTOP
AND HE ACTUALLY CAME UP WITH THIS CONCEPT OF RESONANT ENERGY TRANSFER
IT RUNS THE ANDROID OPERATING SYSTEM
I THINK I HEARD SOMEBODY TALK ABOUT THAT BEFORE
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PHYSICAL HEALTH WE UNDERSTAND THAT AT ONE END OF THE SPECTRUM WE HAVE SOMETHING AS SMALL AND
WE ASKED THEM TO TELL US WHAT EMOTION THEY WERE FEELING AT ANY GIVEN POINT IN TIME AT WHAT INTENSITY THAT EMOTION
SO IF SOMEONE IS GOING THROUGH A BIT OF A ROUGH PATCH WE NEED TO TAKE ACTION AND MAKE SURE THAT SUPPORT IS THERE
BUT I THINK THERE'S ALSO SOMETHING ELSE REALLY MAJOR AT PLAY
I MEAN APART FROM THE FACT THAT MY ALARM WENT OFF AT 5
AND AS I SAID AT THE START THERE ARE FIVE GUYS OUT THERE TODAY WHO ARE ALIVE AT THIS VERY SECOND THEIR HEARTS ARE
AND THE SAME THING NEEDS TO HAPPEN WITH MENTAL HEALTH
THAT'S WHAT WE EXPECTED AS WELL
IT WAS AN APP FOR SMART DEVICES AND WE ENCOURAGED PEOPLE ACROSS AUSTRALIA TO TAKE PART AND LOG
BUT WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THESE STUDIES WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEM CLOSER IS THAT THESE STUDIES OFTEN ABOUT
I SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT TOO THAT IN TERMS OF MEN POTENTIALLY BEING MORE EMOTIONALLY STUNTED THERE
OH I'M OFF TO BROGA YOU CAN SAY
BUT BY LAYING A FOUNDATION OF OPENNESS AND HONESTY YOU'RE ALLOWING THE OTHER PERSON TO
AND AGAIN YOU'D BE FORGIVEN FOR THINKING THAT THE RESULTS BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN WOULD BE VASTLY DIFFERENT
FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE SUICIDE IS WHEN THEIR INBUILT COPING MECHANISMS ARE OUTWEIGHED BY THEIR
THIS IS BACKED UP BY A STUDY THAT CAME OUT OF THE US BY DOCTOR RICHARD SEIDEN WHICH STUDIED 515 PEOPLE
BECAUSE WE KNOW FROM THE DATA THAT IF PEOPLE ARE IN ENVIRONMENTS WHERE OTHER PEOPLE ARE SHARING HOW THEY'RE FEELING THE OTHER
BUT AS SOMEONE WHO WORKS SPECIFICALLY IN MEN'S MENTAL HEALTH I'M GOING TO LEAVE THAT CONVERSATION FOR SOMEONE
FOR EACH COMPLETED SUICIDE THERE IS THEN ANOTHER 20 SUICIDE ATTEMPTS
INSTEAD I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT EACH AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US CAN DO TO HELP REDUCE THE RATE
BUT IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE NEED TO FIRST UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT OF COMMON CONTEXT
WELL ACTUALLY NO I DON'T NEED TO LAUGH AND MOCK THEM BECAUSE IT DOESN'T FIT INTO THIS LITTLE BOX
THIS BRAND NEW FOOD CALLED CORN
SHE WAS TRYING TO ENERGIZE AND DETOXIFY HER BODY
THAT MEANS MORE PEOPLE ARE GETTING TREATED
THAT MEANS WE'RE DECREASING STIGMA
I REALIZED THEN THAT WE HAD TO THINK DEEPLY ABOUT HOW THE TECHNOLOGY WE WORK ON TODAY LOOKS IN FIVE
ELON MUSK WARNS THAT IT'S AN EXISTENTIAL RISK AND ONE OF THE GREATEST RISKS THAT WE FACE AS A
IT'S FLOWN AROUND THE WORLD
THE FEAR IS THE CHILD
IT'S PEOPLE JOINING UP WITH PEOPLE AS BUNDY JUST SAID MILES AWAY
AND I STARTED TO CRY
BUT JUST UNPACK YOUR SUITCASE
THEY CAME AROUND A CORNER FACED WITH A ROW OF MACHINE GUNS
THAT SOLVES THE PROBLEM OF UNEMPLOYMENT
BASIC INCOME IS NOT THE WHOLE OF IT BUT IT IS AN ESSENTIAL
SUPPOSE WE HAVE SUCH AN UNCONDITIONAL BASIC INCOME
WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER PROBLEM THIS RADICAL ALTERNATIVE TO CAPITALISM AS WE KNOW IT
PARTLY BECAUSE THEY WILL HAVE BEEN VACATED BY THE PEOPLE WORKING TOO MUCH BUT ALSO BECAUSE THEY CAN COMBINE THESE
PROBLEM NUMBER ONE UNEMPLOYMENT
NOW YOU KNOW MORE OR LESS WHAT IT IS
I WATCHED THE MASTER ON A TAB OF ACID THEN PERFORMED AFTER AND YET MYSELF WAS AN UNPARALLEL
SO POUR THE GIN
AND HOW WE TREAT OURSELVES STARTS WITH HOW WE SEE OURSELVES
I HAVE ASKED MANY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THIS QUESTION OVER THE YEARS AND TYPICALLY WE GET VERY SIMILAR LISTS OF
THE IDEA IS YOU FIND THE SYNONYM THAT WORKS FOR YOU BUT COLLECTIVELY WE BRIDGE BY USING THIS
YOU MIGHT FIND THAT OTHER PEOPLE MAKE YOU REALLY HOSTILE OR ANGRY
THE IN GROUP OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKE ME AND THE OUT GROUP FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT LIKE ME
BUT THE WORD LOVE IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE IS FAIRLY SLOPPY YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THIS WE SAY I LOVE MY
THERE ARE DOZENS OF OTHER SYNONYMS THAT YOU COULD PICK FROM
THIS IS ALSO TREMENDOUSLY DIFFICULT BECAUSE WHEN YOU START FEELING ALL THE SUFFERING ON THIS PLANET YOU CAN FEEL
SO THE MOVE IS FROM ANTIPATHY TO APATHY
BUT IT'S A BIG STEP FORWARD FROM APATHY SO THIS IS GOOD
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY RELIGION
MOST OF US ARE QUITE ANNOYING AT LEAST TO EACH OTHER
I'M NOT BUT YOU ARE
WHY IS IT THAT WE ARE SO ANNOYING TO EACH OTHER
ALWAYS A SMILE
SHE LIVES BY THAT EVERYDAY
REHABILITATION IS WHAT YOU NEED TO CHANGE
AT THE AGE OF 12 SHE QUIT SCHOOL
SHE IS PRODUCTIVE AND SHE GIVES BACK EVERYDAY
WE BECAME FRIENDS THAT DAY AND WE'VE BEEN FRIENDS FROM THAT DAY TILL NOW
WHEN SHE SAW ME SITTING THERE BY MYSELF 19 YEARS AGO SHE CAME UP AND TALKED TO ME
WITH THE FOUNDATION SHE HAS CREATED FOR HERSELF IT'S UP TO HER TO KEEP THAT FOUNDATION STRONG BY
I HAVE LEARNT SO MUCH FROM HER
SHE'S MADE A DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE'S LIVES INCLUDING MINE
HOW CAN DISCIPLINE BE POSSIBLE WITHOUT ANY CONSEQUENCES
IT WAS ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS TO DO TRYING TO BE A MOTHER AND WATCH THEM GROW UP WITHOUT HER
EDUCATION WAS IMPORTANT TO HER
SHE WOULD SACRIFICE HER CHILDHOOD TO CARE FOR HER FAMILY
WE WANT TO KNOW ABOUT DYNAMIC THINGS GOING AROUND
WHAT HAPPENS TO OUR TESTOSTERONE
NOW FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT AREN'T BIOCHEMISTS OUR GOAL WAS ACTUALLY QUITE SIMPLE OR SIMPLE
SO IF OUR PLANT IS ALSO SHOWN TO HAVE AN
I STOOD MY GROUND
I WAS VERY HESITANT TO ASK FOR MORE MONEY ESPECIALLY SINCE MY INDUSTRY PARTNER HAD ALREADY BEEN
SO THE NEXT STEP WAS OF COURSE THE LAB
LANGUAGE JUST DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY
ARE YOU BOTHERED BY LANGUAGE FADS AND LANGUAGE CHANGE OR DO YOU FIND IT FUN
I HOPE THAT WHAT YOU CAN DO IS FIND LANGUAGE CHANGE NOT WORRISOME
WELL YOU KNOW WHAT
NOW A SECOND QUESTION
AGAIN A SHOW OF HANDS HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE EVER LOOKED TO SEE WHO EDITED THE DICTIONARY
BUT WHO LOOKS AT THE FRONT MATTER OF DICTIONARIES
OSCAR WILDE ONCE SAID AN ECONOMIST KNOWS THE PRICE OF EVERYTHING BUT THE VALUE OF
THE ELECTRIFIED FENCE THAT SURROUNDS THE CAMP
THEY HAVE A HARD TIME DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN CRITICISM AND BETRAYAL
HE SAYS THAT HE'S PHYSICALLY OUTSIDE BUT NOT PSYCHOLOGICALLY OUTSIDE BARBED WIRE
HE'D BEEN EDUCATED IN THE FORMER SOVIET UNION
SHIN DID NOT HESITATE THOUGH
ALMOST ALL OF THEM HAVE BEEN EXAMINED BY GOVERNMENT PSYCHIATRISTS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS IN SOUTH KOREA WHO SAY THAT
ALMOST ALL OF THEM HAVE COME THERE IN THE PAST 12 YEARS
AND NO ONE IS THINKING THAT NORTH KOREA IS ON THE VERGE OF COLLAPSE BUT TOTALITARIAN SYSTEMS DON'T LAST
ONE OF THE THINGS HE TOLD ME IS THAT HE'S EVOLVING FROM BEING AN ANIMAL INTO TRYING TO BE A HUMAN
THERE ARE 24000 NORTH KOREANS NOW LIVING IN SOUTH KOREA
THE ELECTRIC FENCE
BEFORE HIS MOTHER DIED SHE TRIED TO CATCH HIS EYE
HE REFUSED TO LOOK AT HER
LET ME ASK YOU HOW MANY OF YOU KNEW BEFORE I STARTED TALKING THAT THERE ARE CONCENTRATION CAMPS IN NORTH KOREA
THE BUILDING HAD TO RECEIVE 2500 HIGHLY STRUNG RATHER NEUROTIC
AND WHEN I VISITED FIRMS RENOWNED FOR THEIR INGENUITY AND CREATIVITY I COULDN'T EVEN SEE THE
COMPANIES DON'T HAVE IDEAS ONLY PEOPLE DO
NOW WE NEED EVERYBODY
THAT THE BONDS OF SOCIAL SENSITIVITY MUTUAL SUPPORT LOYALTY AND TRUST MAKE A
AND IT WAS ONLY REALLY WHEN WE STOPPED WORKING AND WE SPENT TIME INVESTED
EVERYBODY HAS A VALID PERSPECTIVE
INSTEAD IT'S A BIT LIKE A BABY
THE TERM DERIVES FROM A SOCIOLOGIST WHO STUDIED COMMUNITIES AND IDENTIFIED WHY WAS IT THAT SOME
AND WE WON'T SOLVE THE PROBLEMS THAT WE FACE BY WAITING FOR INDIVIDUAL SUPERMEN OR
IT WAS A BILLION DOLLAR BUSINESS
MOTIVATING PEOPLE BY MONEY HAS TO GO TOO
HELPFULNESS IS WHY THE FIRM SAP THINKS THEY CAN ANSWER ANY QUESTION IN 17 MINUTES
AND LOGOS AND MISSION STATEMENTS DON'T MOTIVATE ANYBODY
THEY WERE COMMISSIONED TO BUILD THE EQUESTRIAN CENTER FOR THE BEIJING OLYMPICS
THEY BROUGHT HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE IN
BUT WHAT WAS REALLY INTERESTING IS THAT THE REALLY SUCCESSFUL GROUPS WERE NOT THE ONES THAT HAD ONE OR TWO PEOPLE
THERE WERE NO PASSENGERS AND NEITHER DID ANYONE DOMINATE EVERYBODY CONTRIBUTED FULLY
FRANK MASLIN THE HEAD OF ENGINEERING SAID THERE WILL BE NO STARS ON THIS TEAM
YOU KNOW NO MENTIONING THAT THREE TOWERS COLLAPSED THAT'S QUITE A BIG MISTAKE
THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY SAY
GENERALLY SPEAKING I THINK WE ALSO HAVE TO REDUCE MILITARY SPENDING
AS HISTORIANS WE OBSERVE THAT POLITICIANS VERY POWERFUL POLITICIANS TELL US NOT TO
NOW WE HAVE THE AMERICAN EMPIRE
I REALLY HOPE THAT 100 RENEWABLE IS SOMETHING THAT WE TOGETHER CAN
IT WORKS TRUST ME
IN 1945 AT THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR WE ONLY USED SIX MILLION BARRELS
WHY ARE WE SEEING ENGAGEMENT CHANGE FORMS
AND THERE'S ALSO A FAILURE IN INTERPRETING YOUTH ACTIVISM AND ENGAGEMENT BACK
AND IN THE LAST CANADIAN ELECTION THE FEDERAL ELECTION NOT THE ONE THAT TOOK PLACE YESTERDAY WAS CHARACTERIZED BY
IT SEEMS THAT FOR YOUTH POLITICS' HAS BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH SELF SERVING NARROW
AND THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THOSE WHO ENGAGE IN SOME FORM OF ALTERNATIVE
THINGS LIKE THE H
IT IS THIS LACK OF MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING THAT PLAGUES THESE ATTEMPTS
BUT WHAT I AM TRYING TO SAY IS WE NEED TO RE EXAMINE HOW YOUTH AND POLITICS
SO WHY ARE WE SEEING PARTICIPATION CHANGE
YOUTH HAVE THE LOWEST VOTER TURNOUT AT ABOUT 37 FOR THOSE UNDER THE AGE OF
AND WE'VE ALL HEARD THE INSULTS AGAINST YOUTH IN POLITICS THAT YOUTH ARE DROPPING OUT OF POLITICS THAT WE'RE
COMPARE THAT THOUGH TO 38 LESS THAN 38 OF THOSE UNDER THE
BUT WHAT IF YOU HAD NO VOICE
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE SEEING
SO WHAT IS THE MORAL OF THIS STORY
WE CAN NOW COMPARE THE MONKEY THAT HAD A MOTHER AND NOT
OR IS IT GOING TO BE AN EASY WORLD AND YOU HAVE TO BE DIFFERENT
MY COLLEAGUE STEPHEN SUOMI HAS BEEN REARING MONKEYS IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS
THESE MONKEYS ALREADY DIDN'T SEE THEIR MOTHER SO THEY HAD A SOCIAL EXPERIENCE
BUT ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TAKE A LANGUAGE APPROACH AND MATH BECOMES INTUITIVE AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND
MATH IS A HUMAN LANGUAGE SO WE ALL HAVE THE ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND IT
JUST REMEMBER THAT MATH IS A LANGUAGE AND USE THAT TO YOUR ADVANTAGE
THEN I ASKED HER A QUESTION THAT KINDERGARTNERS ARE DEFINITELY NOT SUPPOSED TO KNOW
SO SHE SYSTEMATICALLY LEARNED HER TIMES TABLES IN 4 WEEKS AND YES EVEN
AS A RESULT THIS TEENAGER HAD NO CONFIDENCE IN HERSELF
IT'S HOLDING YOU BACK
SHE COULDN'T FACTOR OR SOLVE EQUATIONS AND SHE HAD NO CONFIDENCE IN MATH
SHE'S IN KINDERGARTEN
HOW WAS MATH EVER HUMAN IN THE FIRST PLACE
AND THAT'S WHY KIDS ARE CONFUSED
LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT I MEAN
AND ANOTHER ONE POPPED UP
I WENT TO NEW YORK
I SPOKE TO MR
AND ONE OF THE THINGS HE SAID WHEN WE MET WITH HIM IS THAT HE NOW HAS DEDICATED
MCCALLUM ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO
SO I'M A HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR AND THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS I HAVE WORKED ON
A CONVICTION REVIEW UNIT IS ESSENTIALLY A UNIT IN A PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE WHERE PROSECUTORS
SO WE TOOK A CLOSE LOOK
IT TURNED OUT HE WAS HIRED BY A SCOTTISH DISTILLERY TO UNDERSTAND WHY THEY WERE BURNING SO DAMN MUCH PEAT TO DISTILL THE
SO IT'S A GREAT ILLUSTRATION OF THAT
AND IT'S A WONDERFUL THING
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THE WATER INSIDE THAT POPCORN
WE HAVE A CHAPTER ON GELS
BUT NOW YOU WILL WE PUT A BIOGRAPHY OF JAMES WATT IN
OF COURSE YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY WORKING THE WHOLE TIME
BUYING MESQUITE CHARCOAL WILL NOT ACTUALLY MAKE THAT MUCH DIFFERENCE
OR AT LEAST IT'S UP TO THEM TO FIX THE PROBLEM
NOW THE YAP DON'T ACTUALLY MOVE THESE RAI STONES AROUND OR EXCHANGE THEM THE WAY WE DO WITH
AND EVERY MONTH A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY IS DEDUCTED FROM MY PAYCHECK AND INVESTED IN MUTUAL FUNDS IN MY
OUR ACCESS TO DIGITAL MONEY AND OUR ABILITY TO FREELY TRANSACT IS BEING HELD
BUT IT ALSO GREATLY INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY
WILL WE ALL BECOME SLAVES TO ALGORITHMS AND UTILITY FUNCTIONS
AND THEY CAN PAY ME FOR WHAT THEY FIND OUT
IMAGINE AN INTERNET WITHOUT ADS BECAUSE INSTEAD OF PAYING WITH OUR ATTENTION WHEN WE VIEW
AND WHEN IT DOESN'T IT'S OFTEN THE FAULT OF THOSE LARGE INSTITUTIONS
IT STILL COUNTED
BUT THINGS LIKE THIS HAPPEN IN THE WESTERN WORLD AS WELL AND THE YAP ACTUALLY STILL USE A FORM OF THESE
AND BECAUSE WE'VE DECIDED THAT THEY DO
I COULD NEVER SIT IN BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE
YOU CAN'T JUST GET UP AND RUN OUT OF A JOB INTERVIEW
WHAT IF SHE'S ANXIOUS LIKE ME
ARE YOU GOING TO BE ALRIGHT
I WANTED IT TO STOP BUT I DIDN'T KNOW HOW
MY CHEST STARTED TO FEEL TIGHT
I WAS AT A JOB INTERVIEW
TRY AND GUESS WHO THEY ARE
WHAT MIGHT THAT TELL US
THE WAY YOU AND I COPE WITH OUR LIVES IS HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY OUR MINDS
I'VE PRESENTED ONE STRATEGY TODAY THAT WE KNOW IS EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING SICK LEAVE BY TACKLING THE UNDERLYING PROBLEMS
WHY DID IT WORK
KAREN HAD A SUPERVISOR WHO MADE HER FEEL THAT THE JOB SHE DID WAS NOT GOOD ENOUGH
THE PHILOSOPHY BEHIND THIS APPROACH IS THAT EVERYONE WHO WANTS TO WORK CAN WORK AS LONG AS YOU FIND A GOOD MATCH
LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE
SURROUNDED BY TEMPTATION BOBBY SIMPLY COULD NOT STAY AWAY FROM THE LADIES FOR MORE THAN A FEW DAYS BEFORE HE MANAGED
AT FIRST THAT FEELS LIKE A MUCH NEEDED BREAK AND KIND OF LIKE A RELIEF BUT IT DOESN'T TAKE LONG BEFORE KAREN
THE THERAPIST'S THERE TO WORK WITH KAREN TO REBUILD HER SELF CONFIDENCE AND GIVE HER THE PUSH THAT SHE NEEDED WHILE THE EMPLOYMENT
IT IS NOT 1961
THERE IS NO GALVANIZING CONTEST LIKE THE COLD WAR NO POLITICIAN LIKE JOHN
HARD PROBLEMS ARE HARD
FOR MOST OF HUMAN HISTORY WE COULD GO NO FASTER THAN A HORSE OR A BOAT WITH A SAIL
THEY'VE EXPANDED AND ENRICHED OUR LIVES
COAL AND NATURAL GAS ARE CHEAPER THAN SOLAR AND WIND AND PETROLEUM IS CHEAPER THAN
I WANTED TO SHARE THEM
SO I ASKED EACH TO WRITE THE TESTIMONY WHICH WOULD ACCOMPANY THE PHOTOGRAPH
THE IMPACT IS NOT JUST ONLINE
AND ALONG THE WAY HE BECAME THE FACE FOR THE US GOVERNMENT'S RECENT PATTERN OF PROSECUTING WHISTLEBLOWERS AND
SUDDENLY AFTER YEARS OF CLAIMING IT WAS VITAL TO THEIR CASE THE GOVERNMENT DROPPED THEIR DEMANDS TO RISEN
SO WE RISK SEEING THE PRESS UNABLE TO DO THEIR JOB THAT THE FIRST AMENDMENT IS SUPPOSED TO PROTECT BECAUSE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S
WE OFTEN RELATE SILENCES WITH
LAST JANUARY MY STUDENT WHO ATTEMPTED SUICIDE RETURNED FROM WINTER BREAK WITH A GIFT FOR ME
I WAS AT A PARENT TEACHER CONFERENCE AND A PARENT APPROACHED MY TABLE
THIS WAS THE SECOND TIME IN THREE YEARS THAT I HAD A STUDENT WHO IS SUICIDAL AND THERE WERE NO
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE LABEL FAILING STUDENTS AS FAILURES
AND THERE'S TO SOME EXTENT A BIG STRATEGY MYTH THAT'S PREVALENT IN BUSINESS NOW
HE DEVELOPED AN INTERESTING OUTSOURCING MODEL FOR SEXUAL SERVICES
BECAUSE IF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS CONVINCE EVERYBODY THAT THE SUCCESS OF ANY ORGANIZATION IS ALMOST
A YELLOW SIGN
BUT ALSO THERE SEEMS TO BE A COMPLETE SORT OF GRIDLOCK IN TERMS OF SOLVING THESE SMALL SOLUTIONS
BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WHO CAN ACTUALLY SOLVE THEM ACTUALLY ARE TOO POWERFUL AND TOO PREOCCUPIED WITH SOMETHING THEY THINK OF AS
SO I PUT MY BACKPACK DOWN AND WALKED THE PASSAGE THAT RAN THROUGH TO WHERE THE HEART OF OUR HOME MY FATHER LAY DYING OF
BUT NOT JUST ANY STEPS THE RIGHT STEPS FOR US
WHEN WE ARE OPEN TO THE DIFFICULT EMOTIONS WE ARE ABLE TO GENERATE RESPONSES THAT ARE VALUES ALIGNED
SO WE ARE NOT IN A CITY AREA WE'RE NOT INSIDE A VILLAGE BUT WE ARE OUTSIDE ISOLATED
ONLY IN A COMMUNITY YOU CAN SUPPORT AND SUSTAIN YOURSELF
SO THEY ASKED US TO DO SOMETHING ON THIS SITE THERE WAS NO BRIEF
AS DESIGNERS WHAT WE CAN DO IS CREATE FLEXIBLE SPACES THAT CAN BE USED BOTH AS LIVING AND
WE ARE NOT THERE TO STAY
IT IS FOR THE 10 OF THE POPULATION OF THIS WORLD IT IS OUTDATED
WHERE DO I PUT MY PIGS
SO CONVENTIONAL ARCHITECTURE ELEMENTS THINGS THAT COME TO YOU EVERY TIME YOU HAVE A CLIENT AND THE BRIEF COMES IN
AND UNCLEAR OF COURSE
SOME CALLED IT THE GAY PLAGUE
FOR TOO LONG OUR COUNTRY FELT LIKE WE COULD ARREST OUR WAY OUT OF THIS PROBLEM
THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION TO STRIKE DOWN THE BAN ON SAME SEX MARRIAGE
WE SEE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OTHER FIRST RESPONDERS REVERSING OVERDOSES WITH NALOXONE TO GIVE
DURING 2014 ALONE 28000 PEOPLE DIED OF DRUG OVERDOSES
THIS WAS AN EFFORT STARTED BY CLEVE JONES IN SAN FRANCISCO TO SHOW THAT PEOPLE WHO DIED OF AIDS HAD
WE'VE DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO EXPAND PREVENTION SERVICES TREATMENT
IF YOU HAVE CANCER YOU GET TREATMENT IF YOU HAVE DIABETES YOU GET TREATMENT
GENERALLY PEOPLE WITH OTHER DISEASES GET CARE AND TREATMENT
TOGETHER WE CAN CHANGE PUBLIC POLICY
BUT WE KNOW THAT WE CAN'T
AT ONE POINT A CONGRESSIONAL STAFFER SAID THAT THERE WAS NO WAY THAT I WAS GOING TO BE CONFIRMED BY THE UNITED STATES SENATE
IT'S WHISPERED ABOUT
SOME WOULDN'T EVEN UTTER THE WORDS
I CONTINUED TO DRINK MY WAY THROUGH COLLEGE
AND YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO TELL THAT IF YOU MET ME
RIGHT NOW WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF ONE OF THE GREATEST HEALTH CRISES OF OUR TIME
IT'S CALLED THE SUNGA
SUNLIGHT IS THE BEST DISINFECTANT
THERE WAS NO CONCEPT OF PROGRESS
THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY NEEDS TO PLACE ASSETS IN A COMMONS
BUT YOU ALSO NEED TO HAVE VALUES
WE NEED TO REINVENT THE WHOLE MODEL OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH
THE INTERNET GIVES US ACCESS NOT JUST TO INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE BUT TO THE INTELLIGENCE CONTAINED IN THE
BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE THIS IS MOVING FORWARD
IT WAS A TOOL OF SELF DEFENSE
THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY IS IN DEEP TROUBLE
THE PRINTING PRESS GAVE US ACCESS TO RECORDED KNOWLEDGE
THEY NEED TO START SHARING PRECOMPETITIVE RESEARCH
BUT IN THE TUNISIAN REVOLUTION THE NEW MEDIA DIDN'T CAUSE THE REVOLUTION IT WAS CAUSED BY
IT'S NOT BAD
THE MARKET VALUE OF HIS COMPANY GOES FROM 90 MILLION TO 10 BILLION DOLLARS AND I CAN TELL YOU BECAUSE
YOUR MOST PRECIOUS ASSET GOES OUT THE ELEVATOR EVERY NIGHT
SOMEBODY HAS TO WIN RIGHT
AND YOU BURY IT SOMEWHERE IN THAT BATHTUB
AND I'M GOING TO SHOW EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU HERE TODAY HOW TO DO THAT
THAT'S REALLY SCARY
BUT SO WHAT
AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE WATER PROTECTED THE BASIN FROM BEING IMPACTED BY ASTEROIDS AND
COME ON YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING
WHAT RUNS YOU RIGHT NOW
HE SAID WRITING GREAT CODE
I SAID TRANSFORMING THE WORLD AT WORK
THIS IS POLAND JOHN NOT CALIFORNIA
I LIKE WHAT WOODY ALLEN SAID
BUT APPARENTLY NOT
HE SAID WHAT WOULD BE A PURPOSE WORTHY OF WHO YOU ARE
NOW THAT IS SOMETHING
AND HE SAID OH A COUPLE OF MILLION
WHAT DO YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT
IT TURNS OUT THAT WAS JUST MORE THAN A MARKETING STATEMENT FOR ME
THIS IS REALLY CRUCIAL SO HERE YOU GO
I DON'T THINK SO
AND THEN WHAT MIGHT THAT MAKE POSSIBLE
AND I SAID HOW MANY
THAT IS WHAT LIGHTS ME UP
WHERE DOES IT COME FROM
WE DON'T LOOK BACKWARD
WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM UPSTREAM
HE SAID HE TOLD YOU IT WAS NOT BAD
DON'T DO ANYTHING LESS THAN THAT
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
NO EXCUSE SIR
CHILDREN NEED A NETWORK
AND SO MY WHOLE LIFE THEN WAS DEDICATED TO ROTC AND THE MILITARY
WE TEACH THEM HOW TO GO RIGHT FACE LEFT FACE SO THEY CAN OBEY INSTRUCTIONS AND KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF NOT OBEYING
THAT'S THE ROLE OF YOU GUYS
I SPEND A LOT OF TIME WITH YOUTH GROUPS AND I SAY TO PEOPLE WHEN DOES THE EDUCATION PROCESS BEGIN
EVERY NATION TOUCHES US
THAT'S WHEN STRUCTURE BEGINS
AND SO I PLAY A LITTLE GAME WITH THEM BEFORE I MAKE THEM STAND AT ATTENTION
THAT'S WHEN LOVE BEGINS
EVERYBODY START CHATTING
THEY COME TO RESPECT HIM
BUT SIR NO DON'T TELL ME HOW OFTEN YOU SCRAPED YOUR FACE THIS MORNING
AND THEN YOU CAN SUPPORT US
I'M YOUR DADDY AND YOUR MOMMY
AND SO WE NEED MORE OF THIS KIND OF STRUCTURE AND RESPECT IN THE LIVES OF OUR CHILDREN
WE'RE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT LET'S FIX THE SCHOOLS
THEY KEPT US IN PLAY
AMERICA HAS PAID ME
DOES IT BEGIN IN FIRST GRADE
THAT'S WHY WE NEED SOUND IMMIGRATION POLICY
AND THAT'S WHAT I FOUND
WE'RE INVESTING IN OUR FUTURE
ATTABOY YOU'RE LEARNING FAST
IT GIVES THEM STRUCTURE
I'M YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE
IT'S PART OF THE ANSWER
THIS IS EASY
I EVEN DID IT WHEN I WAS SECRETARY OF STATE
IT MEANS EVERYBODY BE QUIET AND PAY ATTENTION
I MAKE THEM STAND AT ATTENTION LIKE A SOLDIER
NO SLOUCHING NO PANTS HANGING DOWN NONE OF THAT STUFF
I SEE YOU ON TELEVISION
AND I ALSO HAD THIS EXTENDED NETWORK
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON
BUT NOW I'M ALONE
LET'S DO MORE FOR OUR TEACHERS
SO HOW MANY PEOPLE HERE LET'S GET A SHOW OF HANDS HAVE EVER BEEN GIVEN THE IDEA THAT THEY'RE NOT A MATH
SO WE TAUGHT THEM ABOUT THE BRAIN GROWING
WE HAVE TO GET THIS OUT TO KIDS
THEY COULD NAME THE ONE PERSON IN THEIR CLASS WHO WAS A MATH PERSON
AND WE WANT STUDENTS TO KNOW THIS
I'M GOING DO IT
WE GAVE THEM THE SAME TEST AT THE END OF OUR 18 LESSONS AND THEY IMPROVED BY AN AVERAGE OF 50
BUT IT IS FUELED BY A SINGLE MYTH THAT'S OUT THERE IN OUR SOCIETY THAT'S VERY STRONG AND VERY
WE HAVE TO FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE WHAT HAPPENS IN CLASSROOMS
I'M NOT A MATH PERSON
WE CHANGED THEIR BELIEFS
BEFORE THEY CAME TO US THEY HAD TAKEN A DISTRICT STANDARDIZED TEST
BUT MATHS CLASSROOMS HAVE TO CHANGE IN A LOT OF WAYS
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT CHANGING MESSAGES FOR KIDS
AND ONLY NOW IS THE FULL EXTENT OF THE NEED TO ATTEND TO THAT COMING TO LIGHT
BUT THEY FOUND SOMETHING ELSE THAT WAS PRETTY INCREDIBLE
WE THINK YOU HAVE TO LEARN THOSE
AND UNTIL WE CHANGE THAT SINGLE MYTH WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE WIDESPREAD UNDERACHIEVEMENT IN THIS
CAROL DWECK'S RESEARCH ON MINDSET HAS SHOWN US THAT IF YOU BELIEVE IN YOUR UNLIMITED
WE NEED A REVOLUTION IN MATHS TEACHING
IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MANY WORDS YOU CAN SAY HOW MANY PHRASES YOU KNOW
THE REALITY IS THERE IS A THIRD WAY WHICH WAS PRACTICED BY PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD AND MORE RESEMBLES
HOWEVER THE SOLUTIONS ON OFFER WERE MORE OF THE SAME AND SHOWED ME A FUTURE WHERE EVERY FOREST WAS TURNED INTO A FIELD
PERENNIAL AGRICULTURE DOESN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT A MODEL ECOSYSTEM DOESN'T WORK OUT OF THE BOX
IT IS TIME FOR CANBERRA TO MOVE BEYOND ITS INITIAL VISION AS A GARDEN CITY AND SEE ITSELF AS A WORLD LEADING
ALL OF THESE CULTURES WOULD CULTIVATE THE WHOLE LANDSCAPE THEY WERE ABLE TO HARVEST FROM TREE CROPS AND BECAUSE THE
IF WE ARE GOING TO PRODUCE THE FOOD THAT WE NEED IN THE FUTURE WE NEED TO BRING FOOD PRODUCTION INTO OUR CITIES SO THAT CITIES ARE
THEY SLOW DOWN AND CLEAN UP THE WATER THAT GOES DOWN OUR DRAINS BEFORE IT GETS TO THE LAKE
BUT A SEED OF DOUBT CROSSED MY MIND IT WAS ALL WELL AND GOOD IF THIS WOULD WORK IN THE TROPICS BUT I WAS PLANNING TO
IN A FOREST GARDEN WE ARE TRYING TO USE OUR LAYERS AND THESE CONNECTIONS TO CREATE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN THE
THE BEST STUDIED EXAMPLES INCLUDE THE OAK WOODLANDS OF CALIFORNIA THE ARAUCANIAN FORESTS OF CHILE
EVEN IF OUR MAIN CROPS ARE NOT COMING FROM THE FOREST GARDENS THEMSELVES THE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES THAT A FOREST
IF WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO PRODUCE THE FOOD WE NEED IN THE FUTURE WE NEED TO DO SO IN A WAY THAT SUPPORTS AND
NOW IF WE WENT OUT AND RANDOMLY SELECTED SOME PLANTS AND STARTED GROWING THEM IN THE SAME SPACE IT'S LIKELY THAT WE'D
YOU SEE ANOTHER TREND ABOUT OUR FOOD PRODUCTION WAS POINTED OUT TO ME
CANBERRA HAS THIS POTENTIAL GIVEN ITS HISTORY AS A GARDEN CITY
WE TEND TO THINK THAT THESE GREEN SPACES ARE ECOLOGICALLY INTACT BUT MANY OF OURS IN CANBERRA ARE ECOLOGICAL
IT'S MUCH EASIER FOR THIS PEACH TREE TO GET THE NUTRIENTS FOR THE NEEDS THAT IT HAS AND IT CAN PRODUCE MANY MORE PEACHES AS A
THESE IDEAS GO BEYOND OUR BACKYARD AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW FOREST GARDENING COULD APPLY TO MODERN AGRICULTURE
THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF FOREST GARDEN PRINCIPLES AND A LITTLE BIT OF THOUGHTFUL DESIGN A POPULATION OF POLLINATORS COULD BE
LUCKY FOR US THE THEORY STACKS UP
BECAUSE PERENNIAL PLANTS GROW FOR MORE THAN ONE YEAR THEY TEND TO DEVELOP EXTENSIVE ROOT SYSTEMS WHICH REACH DEEP DOWN INTO THE
IF WE START CULTIVATING THEM IN CANBERRA TODAY THEY WILL BE ONLINE FOR US TOMORROW AND WE WILL SEE
AS A RESULT CANBERRA HAS AN ABUNDANCE OF GREEN SPACE IN OUR URBAN AREAS A MUCH HIGHER PROPORTION THAN MANY
THIS IS KIND OF LIKE COMPANION PLANTING BUT ON A MUCH BIGGER SCALE
ONE OF THE BIG MYTHS OF CIVILIZATION IS THAT PEOPLE WERE HUNTER GATHERS ONE DAY DISCOVERED AGRICULTURE AND WE NEVER LOOKED
THE HAWAIIANS WERE GARDENERS BECAUSE WHEN THEY SET OUT TO DISCOVER THE ISLANDS OF HAWAII THEY TOOK WITH THEM IN THEIR CANOES
THE HAWAIIANS WERE GARDENERS BECAUSE RATHER THAN JUST ARBITRARILY PUTTING UP PADDOCKS ON THE ISLAND THEY UNDERSTOOD THE
THERE IS ONE VALLEY IN CALIFORNIA WHICH PRODUCES 30 OF THE WORLD'S ALMOND CROP SO AS YOU CAN IMAGINE
HOWEVER WHEN THEY RETURNED THE WATER THAT THEY USED FOR IRRIGATION TO THE RIVER IT WAS FULL OF SILT AND VERY HIGH IN NUTRIENTS
IF I'VE INSPIRED YOU TODAY YOU CAN GO HOME AND START FOREST GARDENING
PEST CONTROL WOULD BE UNDERTAKEN THROUGH THE USE OF INSECTICIDES BUT THESE ARE KNOWN TO KILL OFF THE POLLINATORS THAT THE PEACH
OR MAYBE OWNING A BUNCH OF STUFF MAYBE THAT WAS RICH
WELL MAYBE NOT
WE SAY THE WATCH HAS A FACE AND HANDS AND A MECHANISM AND A BATTERY
BUT THERE'S ALSO A NARRATIVE A STORY WE TELL ABOUT OURSELVES THE EXPERIENCES WE HAVE WHEN WE REMEMBER PAST
YOU'RE BORN WITH AN ESSENCE THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE UNTIL YOU DIE IF YOU
WE HAVE KNOWLEDGE
WHAT IS THERE THEN
DOES THAT MEAN THAT REALLY THE SELF IS AN ILLUSION
IN A WAY IT'S COMMON SENSE
THE FACT THAT WE ARE IN SOME WAYS JUST THIS VERY VERY COMPLEX COLLECTION ORDERED
NOW WE'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL HERE RIGHT
IN THE SAME WAY WE'RE NOT ILLUSIONS EITHER
NOW YOU MIGHT THINK THIS IS A WORRYING IDEA
NOW THOSE PARTS ARE ALSO PHYSICAL PARTS OF COURSE BRAINS BODIES AND LEGS AND THINGS BUT THEY AREN'T SO IMPORTANT ACTUALLY
IF YOU HAVE A HEART TRANSPLANT YOU'RE STILL THE SAME PERSON
THERE ARE LIMITS TO WHAT WE CAN MAKE OF OURSELVES
WE HAVE SENSATIONS AND EXPERIENCES AS WELL
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE DONE THOSE
A LOT OF COMPANIES USE THESE FOR RECRUITMENT
AND I HAVE TO SAY NOW I'LL SAY IT A BIT LATER BUT I'M NOT CHALLENGING THIS JUST BECAUSE I'M WEIRD THE CHALLENGE ACTUALLY
IF YOU WATCH THE X FACTOR TOO MUCH YOU MIGHT BUY INTO THIS IDEA THAT WE CAN ALL BE WHATEVER WE WANT TO BE
SO WE CAN KEEP THIS GROWTH BASED ECONOMY GOING
IT HAS TO BE CIVIL SOCIETY
BUT ACTUALLY THAT CHILDISH MISREPRESENTATION STUCK WITH ME
IS THIS REALLY HOW ECONOMIES BEHAVE
GOODNESS KNOWS WHAT THEY MAKE OF THE LAKE DISTRICT WEATHER
YOU'RE NOT MAKING NEWS OUT OF THINGS FALLING DOWN
AND MY THEN FIVE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WAS HELPING ME IN THE WAY THAT FIVE YEAR OLDS DO
SO WHO ARE WE
WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE CREATED ECONOMIES
AND ALMOST STRAIGHTAWAY WE ACTUALLY RUN UP AGAINST A COUPLE OF ANOMALIES
WE CAN'T LIVE WITH IT WE CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT IT
BUT THE MATERIALITY MATTERS TOO BECAUSE IN EVERY SOCIETY THAT
IS THIS REALLY HOW PEOPLE ARE
SO THIS IS SOMETHING WE'VE STUDIED FOR A LONG TIME
AND THAT I THINK CAN AFFECT WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE WANT TO SHARE SOMETHING KEEP IT PRIVATE OR JUST KEEP IT OFFLINE ALTOGETHER
AND I SEE THAT AS A REAL PROBLEM GOING FORWARD
SO IF YOU'RE SMART YOU TEND TO BE FRIENDS WITH SMART PEOPLE AND IF YOU'RE YOUNG YOU TEND TO BE FRIENDS WITH YOUNG PEOPLE AND THIS IS WELL
THERE'S A LOT OF POWER THAT USERS DON'T HAVE TO CONTROL HOW THIS DATA IS USED
IT'S POSSIBLE BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE CHANGE QUICKLY
SO USERS CONTROL THEIR DATA
I COULD START THAT BUSINESS TOMORROW AND YOU WOULD HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO CONTROL OVER ME USING YOUR DATA LIKE THAT
THAT SEEMS TO ME TO BE A PROBLEM
IT TURNS OUT THINGS LIKE VIRAL VIDEOS OR FACEBOOK LIKES OR OTHER INFORMATION SPREADS IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY
SO WHAT I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT TODAY IS SOME OF THESE THINGS THAT WE'RE ABLE TO DO AND THEN GIVE US SOME IDEAS OF HOW WE
AND BY THEMSELVES THOSE PURCHASES DON'T SEEM LIKE THEY MIGHT REVEAL A LOT BUT IT'S A PATTERN OF
WE CAN DO ALL OF THIS REALLY WELL
TRANSMEDIA IS A WHOLE NEW SET OF OPTIONS THAT WE HAVE AT OUR DISPOSAL TO TELL OUR
TODAY WHEN WE WATCH THIS FILM WE'RE NOT SCARED
WHO POPS INTO YOUR MIND RIGHT NOW
IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR ME THAT THE COMMUNITY FELT CONNECTED TO THE WORDS
THEY LIVE FROM THE GARBAGE
YOU KNOW THE ART PROJECT WAS JUST A PRETEXT FOR THIS AMAZING HUMAN EXPERIENCE
WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IN THIS THIRD AGE OF SPACE FLIGHT IS THAT THE FRONTIER IS OPENING
I WANTED TO LEAN BACK AND PUSH MY FEET UP UNTIL THEY HIT THE CLOUDS AND JUST KEPT GOING
EVEN WHEN WE GOT TO THE 1990S AND THE CHINESE WERE BRINGING A SPACE PROGRAM ONLINE THEY HAD THE SAME MENTALITY
WELL ONCE WE GOT OVER THE IDEA THAT THIS WAS SIMPLY AN ENVIRONMENT TO BE SURVIVED WE STARTED TO SELECT OUR ASTRONAUTS FOR
AND THAT RIGHT STUFF MEANT VERY VERY FEW PEOPLE COULD GO
SIDE BY SIDE YET THEY COULDN'T HAVE BEEN FURTHER APART
THEY ARE BARELY EVEN KNOW YOU'RE THERE
AND IT'S TRADITIONALLY BEEN THE GO TO SOCIAL PROP FOR MANY
THE BRAIN GETS JUST 10 OF ITS INFORMATION FROM THE OPTIC NERVE
THE INTERNET HAS BROUGHT PEOPLE TOGETHER IN THE MOST INCREDIBLE OF WAYS
WELL IN THE AFTERMATH OF MY VIRAL ACTIVITY I WAS CONTACTED BY VARIOUS MOVEMENTS SUCH AS
IF YOU'VE EVER TRIED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH SOMEONE WHILST THEY'RE GAZING INTO THEIR PHONE YOU WILL NOTICE AFTER A
THAT WAS WHEN YOU BONDED THAT WAS WHEN THE MAGIC HAPPENED
IT MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD
SO WE ARE ALREADY LIVING IN A VIRTUAL REALITY OF OUR OWN MAKING EVEN WITHOUT OUR
YOU COULD BE ON FIRE AND THEY PROBABLY WOULDN'T NOTICE
THE DIFFERENCE IS ALCOHOL IS A VERY EFFECTIVE SOCIAL LUBRICANT UP TO A CERTAIN POINT
AND IT WAS IN THESE MOMENTS YOU COULD MAYBE ESCAPE THE HORRORS OF SMALL TALK AND ARRIVE AT
WE MUST TRY HARDER THAN THAT
BUT FACE TO FACE COMMUNICATION AND ONLINE COMMUNICATION ARE ACTUALLY IN CONFLICT AS THEY BATTLE
ISN'T IT WHY WE'RE HERE
IT WAS A CAN OF WORMS I DIDN'T WANT TO OPEN
PROBLEM WAS PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE ELSE HAD
THE ONLY TIME WE ARE ABLE TO BREAK OUT OF THIS BUBBLE PERSPECTIVE IS WHEN WE COMMUNICATE
SO I SENT THEM MANY HOURS OF RECORDINGS OF MY VOICE INCLUDING SEVERAL AUDIO COMMENTARY TRACKS THAT I'D MADE FOR MOVIES
ONE OF THE FUNNIEST BLOGS ON THE WEB IS WRITTEN BY A FRIEND OF MINE NAMED SMARTASS
THERE WAS SOMETHING COMFORTING ABOUT A VOICE THAT WAS NOT MY OWN
IRONIC THAT MY LEGS ARE FINE AND IT'S MY SHOULDERS THAT SLOW UP MY WALK
ALL OF THEIR VOICES HAD BEEN MADE BY A SPEAKER RECORDING ORIGINAL WORDS IN A CONTROL BOOTH
THEN APPLE RELEASED THE ALEX VOICE WHICH WAS THE BEST I'D HEARD
IT KNEW THINGS LIKE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN EXCLAMATION POINT AND A QUESTION MARK
THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF HTML CODES YOU CAN USE TO CONTROL THE TIMING AND INFLECTION OF COMPUTER VOICES AND I'VE
I THEN TWEETED ABOUT IT
THAT'S FINE BECAUSE I'M NOT 100 CONVINCED MYSELF
SO JUST LIKE ARCHEOLOGISTS WHO DIG THE CENTURIES OLD RUBBISH
IT IS CLEARLY LINKED TO ONE SINGLE EVENT
LOVE AND RESPECT
I WAS FEELING LEFT OUT LIKE I WASN'T QUITE GAY ENOUGH
I'VE EVEN HEARD A POLITICIANS SAY THAT THE GAY LIFESTYLE IS A GREATER THREAT TO CIVILIZATION THAN
AND FORGIVE ME MATTHEW BRODERICK
THAT'S WHAT THE WHOLE FILM WAS ABOUT
IS THAT WHAT YOU CALL IT TOO
I WAS VERY VERY FRUSTRATED
IT'S A WONDERFUL DAY IN OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY IT'S A WONDERFUL DAY IN THE GLOBE'S HISTORY TO BE ABLE TO HAVE AN ACTUAL SITTING
AND THAT'S NOT JUST ABOUT ME
BUT THEN SOMETHING WONDERFUL HAPPENED
ALL WE DO IS COOK FOR THESE PEOPLE
THEY EAT TWO THREE FOUR DINNERS A NIGHT
I KNOW YOU'VE DONE OTHER MOVIES BESIDES FERRIS BUELLER BUT THAT'S HOW I REMEMBER YOU
GREAT MOVIE RIGHT
WELL I SAW MATTHEW BRODERICK ON THE SCREEN AND SO I THOUGHT SWEET
I'LL WATCH THIS
BUT WE DON'T GIVE OURSELVES ENOUGH DOSES OF THAT
SO WE DEVELOP A JUDGMENTAL ATTENTION
THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE SCIENCE DOESN'T KNOW IT
LET'S SAY YOU HAVE NOT MET YOUR PARTNER FOR 30 DAYS
NEVER BEEN ROBBED BEFORE
THESE NETWORKS COLLABORATE TO CREATE TWO MODES OF THE BRAIN
SO RIGHT NOW AS WE SPEAK TWO TO THREE BILLION PEOPLE ARE WALKING AROUND THE PLANET WITH NO IDEA WHERE THEY ARE
OR CHASING DEADLINES
CAN I TRUST HIM WITH MY CATTLE MY HOUSE MY FAMILY
SO THAT IS A CHALLENGE
MINUS FIVE SECONDS RIGHT
I HAVE FINITE TIME
HONEY YOU WERE REALLY RIGHT WHEN YOU
WHAT SHOULD I DREAD
SO I'M SURE YOU'VE EXPERIENCED THIS OR NOT EXPERIENCED THIS
SO WE WERE FOCUSED ON SAFETY AND SURVIVAL
THEY WORK 100 PERCENT OF THE TIME
THESE ARE ALL INTENTIONAL SPRINKLE PRACTICES
THE FIRST MODE OF THE BRAIN IS THE FOCUSED MODE
ANOTHER CHALLENGE IS HEDONIC ADAPTATION
I HAD COME HERE TO BECOME A CANCER SPECIALIST
OUR MIND IS WANDERING
THAT IS WHAT WE NEED AND WE ARE SPRINKLING IT
TWO SUPPORTING IDEAS HERE
IT WAS ANARCHY
I KNOW THIS STUFF
SECURITY COUNCIL AND FOR THE MEMBERS OF THE U
AND IT WAS LIKE THAT FOR ME
AND I STARTED TO FALL
I WANTED TO BE AN AMBASSADOR AND MY MENTORS MY HEROES PEOPLE WHO GOT TO THE TOP OF MY PROFESSION AND HERE I
I WENT THROUGH THOSE MOBS
AT THAT TIME THERE WAS JUST ME AND ME AND MY WIFE WERE MOVING BACK TO NEW YORK
AND SO THAT WAS THE IDEA
WHY DON'T YOU ADVISE THEIR GOVERNMENT ON THEIR DIPLOMACY
IN NEW YORK WHEN I STARTED INDEPENDENT DIPLOMAT
THOSE OTHER THINGS ARE CALLED NON STATE ACTORS
WE WENT AROUND 70 U
AND INDEPENDENT DIPLOMAT IS A KIND OF EXAMPLE OF THIS IN A SORT OF LOOSE WAY
IT'S WHAT I DO
AND FUNNILY ENOUGH THEY WERE FRUSTRATED ABOUT THAT
THAT IS THE STATE OF THE WORLD TODAY
EVERYBODY WENT YES OF COURSE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT
18 PEOPLE WERE KILLED
THESE THINGS REALLY INTERESTED ME
I HAD BEEN STEEPED IN THE INTELLIGENCE ON IRAQ AND ITS WMD AND MY TESTIMONY TO
AND HE GOES YOU KNOW I JUST CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE
SECURITY COUNCIL TO EXPLAIN TO THEM WHAT THEY WANT
WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO EMBRACE THAT REALITY
YOU CAN'T FIGHT IT SO EMBRACE IT AND FIND A WAY TO WORK WITH IT
THIS DISTRIBUTION OF BRAND ENERGY GETS YOUR BRAND CLOSER TO THE PEOPLE MORE IN WITH THE PEOPLE
THE MESSAGE FOR MARKETING IS THAT YOUR BRAND IS MORE DISPERSED
IT'S THE SAME IN MARKETING
SO WITH THE ACT OF OBSERVING CONSUMERS CHANGES THEIR BEHAVIOR
THE MARKETING IS THE MESSAGE FOR MARKETING IS THAT TRY TO MEASURE WHAT CONSUMERS ACTUALLY
TOLD ME I COULDN'T DO IT BUT I DID
BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT LEADERSHIP IS
I EXPERIENCE THIS ALL THE TIME WHERE YOU KNOW PEOPLE HAVE A LOT OF EXPECTATIONS RELIGIOUS ONES AND CULTURAL
IT IS THROUGH ART THAT WE CAN REALLY TELL OUR OWN STORY
NOW I LIVE IN A RECENTLY CONVERTED FLAT WITH A PRIVATE LANDLORD AND I HAVE A HOUSEMATE
I TURNED OFF TARGETED ADVERTISING AND I ASKED FACEBOOK TO SEND ME ALL THE INFORMATION THAT THEY HELD ON ME
PERSONALISED BROWSER ADS MAY BE HARMLESS BUT CONNECTING DISPARATE ASPECTS OF YOUR LIFE TO
I HAVE GIVEN UP MY RIGHT TO SELF DETERMINATION AND FREE CHOICE
PERSONAL DATA IS CONSIDERED ANYTHING THAT CAN BE TRACED DIRECTLY BACK TO YOU
IN 2015 SAMSUNG WAS FOUND TO BE RECORDING PEOPLE IN THE HOMES IN WHICH THEIR TVS HAD BEEN
FOR EXAMPLE I STOPPED SIGNING UP TO SUPPOSEDLY FREE SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE A VIP CARD AT MY
I MADE UP A FAKE EMAIL ADDRESS AND I STARTED REGISTERING WITH A FAKE AGE AND GENDER
I IMMEDIATELY WROTE TO MY LOCAL COUNCIL AND ASKED THEM TO MAKE MY VOTER RECORDS PRIVATE
THIS MEANS IT WILL BECOME TOO EXPENSIVE FOR COMPANIES GOVERNMENTS AND NON PROFITS TO RECKLESSLY
I REALISED ON MY PHONE THAT EVERY TIME I LOGGED FITNESS DATA INTO THE APP ENDOMONDO IT WAS SHARING MY
IT'S NOT JUST LARGE COMPANIES DIGGING INTO YOUR LIFE IT'S FREE APPS AND SMALL STARTUPS AS WELL
COMPANIES ARE ALSO STARTING TO PREDICT FUTURE BEHAVIOURS FOR EXAMPLE WHETHER YOU'RE A TRUSTWORTHY DRIVER A GOOD
IT ONLY MEANS THAT THEY NEED YOUR PERMISSION
LAST WEEK I PASSED THROUGH UPPER STREET IN NORTH LONDON ON MONDAY AND WEDNESDAY EVENINGS AT 7 P
I DON'T OWN ANY FURNITURE AND I DON'T HAVE ANY CHILDREN
I LIKE THE IDEA OF LIVING ABROAD SOMEDAY
I HAVE A GLOBAL VISION FOR VISION
HOW DO YOU DISTRIBUTE
OUR MORAL INTEGRITY IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY AND WE MUST BE PREPARED TO DEFEND IT EVEN WHEN IT'S
IF IT DOESN'T MATTER TO YOU WHO I SLEEP WITH THEN YOU CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT IT FEELS LIKE WHEN I WALK DOWN THE
AND AS WE WALK IN IT IS A SCENE I CAN ONLY DESCRIBE YOU AS SAYING IT LOOKED LIKE NORWAY THROW UP
WHICH ONE WAS MORE IMPORTANT
THAT LINE ACTUALLY WENT THE OTHER WAY
GASOLINE COSTS ARE A TREMENDOUS DRAIN ON THE AMERICAN ECONOMY BUT THEY'RE ALSO A DRAIN ON INDIVIDUAL
THEY WEREN'T FARMERS THEY WERE JUST GETTING RICH FOR STUFF COMING OUT OF THE GROUND
WE ACTUALLY ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO DRIVE MORE
THERE WERE NO LIPS
IF IT SANK IT WOULD BE A WHOLE DIFFERENT STORY AS FAR AS AN OIL SPILL
IT ALSO MAKES IT VERY VISCOUS
IF YOU ARE A SCIENTIST AND YOU HAVE AN IDEA FOR A PROJECT FOR WHICH YOU WOULD NEED THE HELP OF ALL THESE
IT WAS THE FORMER THOUGH THEY CHECKED THE AREA AND IT WAS ACTUALLY THERE
HANNY IS MY NAME AND VOORWERP IS THE SLIGHTLY BORING WORD FOR OBJECT
IT'S ABOUT 650 MILLION LIGHT YEARS FROM EARTH
ARE YOU RELIABLE
ARE YOU A CHEAT
IT ENABLES US TO CONSTRUCT EXTREMELY SOPHISTICATED NETWORKS OF ECONOMIC
AND I STARTED SPRAYING THAT ON THE STREETS IN CAIRO
IN MY YEARS TOILING AWAY IN LABS AND IN PEOPLE'S BACKYARDS INVESTIGATING AND CATALOGING THE
MY GOAL IS NOT TO FIND TECHNOLOGY TO KILL THE NEW MICROSCOPIC LIFE AROUND US
SO IT'S REALLY INTERESTING
IT'S MORE LIKE THAT
AND NOBODY KNOWS IF THEY REALLY CAN LIVE FOREVER OR WHAT KEEPS THEM FROM AGING
SO HE DOESN'T ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING HIMSELF
NOW I DON'T WANT YOU ALL TO GO OUT TAKING RAPAMYCIN
IT IS A DRUG FOR PEOPLE BUT THE REASON IS IT SUPPRESSES THE IMMUNE SYSTEM
A LONG STRAIN OF VERY INNOVATIVE PRODUCT LAUNCHES WITHOUT A SERIOUS MISSTEP
HE MUST'VE FOUND A WAY TO KEEP THE ERRORS AND FAILINGS ON THE INSIDE OF THE COMPANY
IN 1998 I WAS A FIRST YEAR EMERGENCY MEDICINE RESIDENT AT CHARITY HOSPITAL IN NEW ORLEANS
FOR EXAMPLE DURING HIS SECOND TENURE AT APPLE STEVE JOBS WOULD SELECT 100 OF THE SMARTEST PEOPLE
SO I ASKED HIM
YOU'RE NOT AS OBJECTIVE AS YOU THINK
HOW LONG SHOULD WE PERSIST
HOW LONG SHOULD WE CONTINUE TO FAIL
ONE DAY I SAW A 70 YEAR OLD MAN A PATIENT WHOSE CHIEF COMPLAINT WAS
SO I PRESENTED THE PATIENT TO MY SENIOR RESIDENT I ORDERED SOME CRUTCHES FOR HIM TO GO OUT ON WROTE HIM A PRESCRIPTION FOR NON
EVERYONE WAS FULLY ENGAGED DURING THE PRESENTATION AND EVERYONE MADE MISTAKES
I COULD'VE MADE THE SAME ERROR
THEY DON'T LIKE LAVENDER AND CLOVER
THEY NEED FOOD AS IN FLOWERS AND THEY NEED NESTING SIGHTS
YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW THAT HONEY BEES AREN'T NATIVE TO NORTH AMERICA
THEY'RE FROM EUROPE
I CAN TELL YOU FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE AND HOW IT FEELS IN MY BODY AND TESTS ARE DONE FOR MYSELF THERE ARE SO MANY MORE
NOT DAYS NOT WEEKS
NOW IS THE TIME TO WAKE UP
LIKE SOME OF THE MASS COFFEE PRODUCERS CLAIM
ARE YOU READY FOR THE AGE OF ENLIGHTENMENT 2
ONCE ROASTED THEY TASTE DIFFERENT
LET'S THINK ABOUT THAT FOR 10 SECONDS
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR OTHERS IT'S NOT THE PAST IT'S NOT THE PRESENT IT'S ONLY ABOUT THE FUTURE
COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS
AND IF NECESSARY SHED YOUR RACIST SKIN
THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN
TRUTH TELLING ACCORDING TO MICHAEL IGNATIEFF NARROWS THE RANGE OF PERMISSIBLE LIES
I WOULD ADD TO THAT THAT BY NARROWING THE RANGE OF PERMISSIBLE LIES THE GROUND IS PAVED FOR AN HONEST ACKNOWLEDGMENT
THEIR ASSUMPTION WAS THAT THIS CHILD WOULD EVENTUALLY GROW UP TO BE DARK SKINNED
WHAT THIS SUGGESTED TO ME IS THAT HONEST PORTRAYAL OF FAMILIES WAS A PARTIAL ONE
SURE ENOUGH I FOUND A NUMBER OF EXAMPLES THAT RESONATED WITH WHAT ANA HAD SAID TO ME
I'M AFRAID THEY WILL LOVE HER MORE
OTHER FAMILIES DEVELOPED ALTERNATIVE ANTI RACIST PERSONAS
BUT NOT JUST THAT IT MUST ALSO PROMOTE CONCRETE PUBLIC POLICIES CONCRETE
SO FIRST I MET A WOMAN BY THE NAME OF DO A ELENA
THE QUESTION THAT DRIVES MY WORK IS WHETHER OR NOT IT MIGHT BE TRUE THAT WHAT
AS IT RELATES TO RACE IN PARTICULAR FAMILIES CAN CERTAINLY PROTECT FAMILY MEMBERS AGAINST
SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
THAT AWARENESS OF HOW TO STAY IN THE MOMENT CALM AND FOCUSED TO PERFORM OPTIMALLY
SO LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE
THESE MEN AND WOMEN DON'T HAVE TIME TO CHOKE OR FREEZE
AVIO STANDS FOR AVIATION AND PREP STANDS FOR PREPARATION
OR AS THE ACRONYM TELLS US ITS A PILOT RESILIENCE ENHANCING PROGRAM
I WANTED TO DO MY THING MY WAY I GRAVITATED TOWARDS DOING ONE MAN SHOWS
WRITING IS TECHNOLOGY
IT'S PART OF MY PROCESS NOW
AND THERE'S THAT WEB BROWSER SINGING ITS SIREN SONG OF TEMPORARILY RELIEF IN DISTRACTION AND THERE'S 1001
THERE'S JUST ME AND THE AUDIENCE
I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING MOST OF US KNOW DEEP DOWN
SO THE INNER SCRIPT IS TO DEFEND MY POSITION NO MATTER WHAT FACTS ARE ACTUALLY BEING EXCHANGED
IT FEELS LIKE THERE'S A TUG A WAR GOING ON FOR THE FUTURE
ANOTHER THEME WEEK WAS ABOUT COMMUNITY AND THE MOST RECENT ONE WAS ABOUT WOMEN
I GOT GOOD GRADES IN SCHOOL BUT I DIDN'T LIKE BEING THERE DOING THE SAME THINGS AS EVERYBODY ELSE
AND THEN I ACTUALLY READ THE NOTES
THIS IS WHAT I DO NOW FOR A LIVING
THEY'RE ALL VERY SIMPLE AND VERY BASIC
IT'S A RARE EVENT
THERE HAVEN'T BEEN THAT MANY TECHNOLOGICAL PARADIGM SHIFTS
ANYBODY CAN USE THEM IN THEIR LIVES WHETHER THEY'RE RUNNING A WEBSITE OR NOT
AND IF THEY'RE APPROACHING WITH THE SAME ATTITUDE THEN THERE IS NO DUALISTIC WINNING AND LOSING
THERE GOES THAT REACTION AGAIN
WHAT CAN WE DO
AND WE WERE LISTENING
IT'S UPPED OUR PRODUCTIVITY THE QUALITY OF OUR WRITING AND I CAN ONLY IMAGINE IT'S GOING TO KEEP GOING IN THIS DIRECTION
SOMETHING BARBARA EHRENREICH ONE OF MY FAVORITE WRITERS JOURNALISTS AUTHOR AWESOME PERSON
LET'S SEE WHAT A BUNCH OF US CAN DO THAT WE COULDN'T DO ON OUR OWN
WE CAN CHOOSE TO PUT OUR HEADS TOGETHER AND BUILD ON WHAT WE AND OTHERS KNOW
I GET 100 CREATIVE CONTROL
SO NOW WHEN I'M WRITING SOMETHING FOR BEAMS AND STRUTS I'LL WORK ON IT AND WORK AND WORK TILL I REACH A POINT WHERE THE ARTICLE
IF I WANTED TO SURF DOWN A RIVER OF LAVA WHAT WOULD THE SURFBOARD NEED TO BE MADE OUT OF
WE'VE BOTH SPENT AT LEAST SOME TIME LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE WE WERE EMOTIONALLY INVESTED IN FROM A NEW POINT OF VIEW
FOR THAT ONE WE UPPED THE ENGAGEMENT
WE'RE EXTRACTING NON RENEWABLE RESOURCES FROM THE EARTH AS FAST AS WE CAN AND WHO CARES ABOUT THE DAMAGE
IT WAS MY DREAM TO BE AN ACTOR I WENT TO UNIVERSITY TO STUDY THEATER AND I DIDN'T LIKE BEING IN PLAYS WITH OTHER PEOPLE
WORKING LIKE THIS DOES NOT COME NATURALLY TO ME
I AM VERY INDIVIDUALISTIC
MORE PEOPLE THAN EVER ARE WILLING TO WORK AS A TEAM EVEN WITH STRANGERS TO SHARE EVEN WITH STRANGERS
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
THERE IS A GROWING TIDE OF THIS OUT THERE IN THE DIGITAL AGE EVEN THOUGH THERE'S SO MUCH DUALISTIC DEBATING AND INSTANT GRATIFICATION
I ALWAYS HAVE BEEN
ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE GROUP REFERRED TO IT AS LITERARY YOGA
A LOT OF OUR FOOD COMES FROM FACTORY FARMS AND FACTORY SHIPS MONOCROP AGRIBUSINESS LOADED WITH GMOS SHIPPED ACROSS THE COUNTRY OR
WE'RE BOTH LISTENING AND ASKING QUESTIONS
BUT WE WANT TO MAKE THEM HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION THAT WE CAN GET THE CELLS TO DO WHAT WE WANT BUT NOT BE SO
WE'RE ACTUALLY ACTIVELY LOOKING FOR MATERIALS THAT WILL BE BIOACTIVE THAT WILL INTERACT WITH THE BODY AND THAT
AND ACTUALLY WE KNOW THAT THOSE CELLS IN THE BODY IN THE EMBRYO AS THEY DEVELOP CAN FORM A DIFFERENT KIND OF
THEY'VE TAKEN THINGS OFF THE SHELF
ONE OF MY FAVORITE EXAMPLES IS THAT OF SIR HAROLD RIDLEY WHO WAS A
WHATEVER LIFE THROWS AT US WHETHER IT'S CANCER DIABETES HEART DISEASE OR EVEN BROKEN BONES WE
SLIGHTLY TECHNICAL SOME PHYSICISTS WILL DISAGREE WITH THIS
WHAT'S THE POINT OF THESE RADIO WAVES THAT YOU'VE FOUND
ELECTRONS DISAPPEAR IN A KIND OF FUZZ AND THERE IS ONLY ENERGY
NOBODY EVER WILL
DON'T LET ANYONE TELL YOU THEY UNDERSTAND ELECTRICITY
BUT I GUESS SOMEBODY WILL FIND A USE FOR THEM SOMEDAY
AND YOU CAN'T SEE THE PAST EXCEPT IN YOUR MEMORY
YOU CAN'T SEE THE FUTURE OBVIOUSLY
THE POINT MOST OF US
AND HE SAID WELL I'VE NO IDEA
BUT WE CAN'T SEE WHAT'S THE MATTER
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS
WE CAN'T SEE INTO THE ENGINE ROOM
AND I SAID YES
AND HE SAID WHY CAN'T I
WHAT ARE WE
THEY ARE MUCH MORE SOPHISTICATED IN SENSING THAN ANIMALS
AND WHY ARE THEY SO SIMILAR
AND THAT IS WHERE I THINK VIDEOGAMES CAN REALLY SHINE
AND FOLDIT IS REALLY MORE OF A PUZZLE GAME
AND THAT PAINTED A REALLY CLEAR PICTURE FOR ME
OR A MORE POIGNANT EXAMPLE IS THE
AND FROM THERE I CAN MAKE BETTER CHOICES ABOUT HOW TO BUILD MARKET AND MONETIZE OUR GAME
YOU HAVE THIS INNATE KNOWLEDGE OF IT
BUT YOU WEREN'T THINKING ABOUT CHEMISTRY BACK WHEN YOU WERE ROASTING MARSHMALLOWS
WHO'S YOUR MARKET
AND WHERE DID THE MONEY COME FROM USUALLY
WE CAN TAKE ACTION
I WAS IN SOUTH AFRICA WITH MR
WE HAD EIGHT TIGER SHARKS
FOR THE FIRST FEW WEEKS AFTER I STARTED WORKING ON THE FARM I WAS SO TIRED THAT I WOULD DREAM THAT I WAS RIDING
SO LEARN ABOUT THIS HISTORY WHERE YOU FIT INTO IT AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT
BECAUSE UNLIKE THE KINDS OF CORN AND SOYBEANS WHICH ARE THE PRIMARY
I THINK IT'S GREAT IT'S FANTASTIC
DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN
AND DO WHAT YOU CAN TO MAKE THAT CHANGE HAPPEN
AND THEN DO IT OVER AGAIN
IT'S LIKE A CROSS BETWEEN A BEET AND A BROCCOLI RABE
THIS CREATES A VICIOUS CYCLE
SOYA LECITHIN LOCUST BEAN GUM THE SALT SOLUTION THAT POULTRY
WHY DID PEOPLE COMPLAINED ABOUT THE PRICES HE CHARGED
I WORKED WITH PROFESSOR KEVIN SCANNELL
WELL WE TOOK LANGUAGE PROCESSING TOOLS THAT HAVE BEEN DESIGNED FOR USE WITH GRAMMATICAL WELL STRUCTURED IRISH
SPELL THEM PHONETICALLY
WE WANTED TO FIND OUT JUST HOW IRISH IS BEING USED ONLINE
AND YOU START TO ENGAGE WITH THE OTHER LINGUISTIC COMMUNITY SPEAKERS
IT'S A VERSION OF IRISH THAT'S MORE ACCESSIBLE TO A BROADER RANGE OF SPEAKERS AND IN PARTICULAR TO
WHAT CHALLENGES WOULD ARISE
AND WHAT WE'VE FOUND IS IRISH IS BEHAVING JUST LIKE ANY OTHER LANGUAGE ONLINE AND ANY OTHER LANGUAGE
LOUIS UNIVERSITY IN THE U
THE SPELLING RULES ARE RELAXED
GRAMMAR RULES ARE RELAXED
YOU CAN SHORTEN WORDS
WE'RE CUTTING CORNERS AND EVERY TIME WE CUT CORNERS MORE PLACES GET INFECTED THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE AND IT JUST SLOWS US
THEY HAD COME FROM THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY
IT DOESN'T SURVIVE IN THE ENVIRONMENT HARDLY AT ALL
WE HAVE A BIG GAP IN THAT MONEY
WE'RE TRYING TO GIVE A FUTURE TO OUR PAST IN ORDER TO HAVE A FUTURE
BUT THERE ARE OTHER FORCES AT WORK TOO
I THINK OF US AS THE FLYOVER STATES
A PRIMAL APPRECIATION FOR THE BOND WE SHARED
MOST MIDDLE BORNS DON'T GET QUITE AS SWEET A DEAL
AND THERE CAN BE SELF ESTEEM ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT I'VE BEEN ASKED TO DO TED SO I FEEL MUCH
THAT'S NOT FIGHTING THAT'S PERFORMANCE ART
SCIENTISTS CALL THIS DEIDENTIFICATION
I LOVE THIS IDEA OF ENGAGEMENT
SO WHEN YOU LEAVE HERE TODAY I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO ENGAGE OR RE ENGAGE
AND HE WOULD REACT TO BEING DISTURBED ON A SATURDAY MORNING BY STALKING INTO THE PLAYROOM AND
I WAS TRAPPED IN A CAGE PREY AMONG PREDATORS FIGHTING FOR FREEDOM I NEVER HAD
CHECK THIS OUT
AND I SAID WHAT'S THAT
CANDY WRAPPERS CLOTHING LOGOS STREET SIGNS EVERYTHING
IT'S A LIFESTYLE
I MEAN HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO IT
SOON AFTER I COMMITTED MY FIRST CRIME AND IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT I WAS TOLD THAT I HAD POTENTIAL AND FELT
I COULDN'T READ WRITE OR SPELL
THEY DIDN'T CARE ABOUT MY LIFE
WHAT DO PEOPLE THINK ABOUT IT
THEN THE QUESTION IS CAN YOU REASSEMBLE WITH THAT GENOME THE WHOLE BIRD
YOU KNOW DO YOU WANT EXTINCT SPECIES BACK
I THINK IT'S TIME FOR THE SUBJECT TO GO PUBLIC
IT HAPPENED TO LOTS OF MAMMALS
WHERE WOULD YOU START
WELL YOU'D START BY FINDING OUT IF THE BIOTECH IS REALLY THERE
WHICH ONE IS THE BAD DOLL
SHE GOT SO MUCH FINANCIAL SUPPORT
AT A YOUNG AGE TOYS INFLUENCE HOW WE THINK HOW WE ACT AND HOW WE SEE OURSELVES
IS ANYONE FAMILIAR WITH THAT
SO TAKING ALL THIS INFORMATION I HAD TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO TAKE MY SKILLS AS AN ARTIST AND WHAT I KNOW ABOUT COLORISM AND
I LEARNED A LOT
AND SHE WAS ON ELLEN
A BLACK BARBIE
IT'S PRETTY FUN IT MAKES IT EASIER AND IT HELPS GIRLS EMBRACE THEIR NATURAL HAIR
WHICH ONE IS THE UGLY DOLL
I STARTED CRYING BECAUSE TO ME IT WASN'T THE REAL BARBIE BECAUSE IT WASN'T THE PRETTY BARBIE
AND IT'S SO FUNNY BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH A SIMPLE THING THAT HELPED ME
IN MY RESEARCH I CAME ACROSS THE MAMIE CLARK DOLL TEST
AND THIS TIME HE FULLY KNEW WHY
COM ARE FILLED WITH THESE KINDS OF INQUERIES
THIS IS SOMETHING I LEARN FROM MANNY
THREE SIMPLE WORDS YOU CAN DO RIGHT NOW
THERE'S NO SINGLE RECIPE THAT WILL INCREASE YOUR HAPPINESS AT ALL TIMES AND FOR
TELL ME MORE AND WHAT HAPPENED NEXT
WELL OUR BRAINS ARE THE EXACT SAME WAY
YOU MUST REPROGRAM YOUR BRAIN WITH DIFFERENT THOUGHTS
WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS TAKE THE VIRUS OUT WHICH IS CALLED FEAR
FIRST I CREATED MY WEBSITE WITH ALL THE COOL DIFFERENT SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY ENGINEERING AND MATH VIDEOS
WHERE RIGHT NEXT DOOR THERE'S A CRACK HOUSE AND I SEE PEOPLE GETTING HIGH ON THE
SO THAT'S WHAT I DID
BUT WHEN WE TAKE ACTION IN DIRECT OPPOSITION FROM OUR FEAR SOMETHING AMAZING HAPPENS
AND THE WHO HAS FIGURES THAT SUGGEST ABOUT 1
IT'S GETTING MORE SYSTEMATIC
SO POTENTIALLY WITH THIS NEW LEVER THAT WE HAVE WITH THE NANOPATCH WE CAN HELP MAKE THAT HAPPEN
THERE ARE MANY FACETS THAT GO INTO ITS RADIATION TOLERANCE AND IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE AS TRANSFERRING ONE GENE
AND SO NOW WHAT I WANT TO DO IS I JUST WANT TO REMIND YOU ALL TO REALLY TRY STARTING
I THOUGHT I WAS THE UGLY DIFFERENT ONE AMONG MY CHILDHOOD FRIENDS IN
I WANT YOU TO REPEAT THESE WORDS
WHY AM I HERE
I BELIEVE WE CAN TEACH KIDS ABOUT COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY BY HAVING THEM DO WHAT THEY LIKE TO DO BEST
LET ME SHOW YOU HOW SIMPLE THIS CAN BE
IT'S LIKE A MOVEMENT
YOU SHOULD COME AND FILM IT
VAPORWAVE IS MORE THAN AN ART FORM
BUT ANYWAY SUNRISE MALL WAS USED IN THE FILM AS A FILMING LOCATION
WE CAN SEE THIS UNIQUE FINGERPRINT
WE GET CONFIRMATION THAT INDEED THE GENE IS TURNED ON FOR SOMETHING LIKE PROZAC IN SEROTONERGIC
SO IF YOU'RE IN DRUG DISCOVERY FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN GO THROUGH AN ENTIRE LISTING OF WHAT THE GENOME
YOU MAY NEVER CATCH UP
WE HAVE A WIC OFFICE CAPABLE OF REACHING THESE PEOPLE
IN WIC YOU DON'T JUST GET A LITTLE PLASTIC CARD AND GO TO THE GROCERY STORE AND DO WHATEVER YOU WANT
OH BLESS YOUR HEART I'LL TAKE CARE OF THAT
IT INVOLVES UNITED WAY IT INVOLVES THE ANNE E
AND ALL THOSE LOW RISK MOTHERS
LANGUAGE IS THE VERY BASIS OF SOLVING THE PROBLEM OF POVERTY
SO FAR WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT WORKS
I BELIEVE IT'LL WORK BUT WHAT WE WANT TO KNOW IS DOES IT REALLY WORK
OH LOOK AT THOSE TOES
I'VE KNOWN I WANTED TO BE A DOCTOR FROM AGE EIGHT
THEY WENT INTO THE HOMES OF 42 FAMILIES AND THEY HAD AN INTENSE OBSERVATION
OH YOUR DIAPER NEEDS TO BE CHANGED
THEY SAY 28 27
ALL START UPS ARE RISKY BUT THIS WAS TWICE AS RISKY AS THE AVERAGE START UP
I THINK LABORERS ARE AMAZINGLY VALUABLE AND HONORABLE WORK
WE COULD PUT IT ON THE CREDIT CARD AND YOU'LL LET US MOVE BACK IN WITH YOU WON'T YOU
PARENTS SAY THIS WHEN I WAS 25 I HAD A MORTGAGE AND A KID
THE BOSS IS GOING YOU'RE MY BEST MILLENNIAL
CHANGE PEOPLE THEY DATE
WE'RE FINE AND WE BOTH WANT TO LIVE IN RHODE ISLAND
THEY'RE FACETIMING I THINK THIS IS MY SOUL MATE
I FOUND SOMEBODY IN SEATTLE ON MATCH
THEY HAVE HAND ME DOWN FURNITURE IN THE BACK OF A U HAUL AND HE JUST RESIGNED LAST WEDNESDAY
DUDE COME BACK
IF IT'S A LIFE STAGE IT'S A CHANGE THAT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND AND ADAPT TO
THEY'RE DIRT POOR
WE ALL SEE IT WE JUST DIDN'T HAVE A NAME FOR IT
HE SAID MY NEW BRIDE CAN WORK
SIMPLE THE RESEARCH IS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR
YOU GRADUATE WITH AN APPRENTICESHIP AND ARE ABLE TO READ A BLUEPRINT AND YOU'RE A WELDER YOU START AT
HOW DO WE KEEP THEM FROM LEAVING
I'M GOING TO GO MAKE THIS WORK
SHE CAN GET INTO ANY GRAD SCHOOL WITH HER GRADES
SO THEY MOVED TO RHODE ISLAND WHICH HAS GREAT LOBSTER ROLLS I HAVE TO TELL YOU AFTER LIVING IN CHICAGO
YOU GRADUATE WITH A BUSINESS DEGREE YOU MAKE 45000 DOLLARS AS A SALESMAN
WE DIDN'T FACETIME WE WROTE EACH OTHER LETTERS FOR SIX MONTHS WHILE WE WERE ENGAGED
THEY'RE QUITE HAPPY
BECAUSE A PLANE FLIGHT WAS 200 DOLLARS AND LONG DISTANCE WAS 2 DOLLARS A MINUTE
HE WAS GOING TO GET A BUSINESS JOB LAST YEAR
CHANGE PLACES THEY LIVE
WHEN HE GRADUATES HIS MOTHER SAYS GO DO THIS RESIDENCY
HIS MOTHER SAID NO YOU HAVE 500 DOLLARS TO YOUR NAME AND A NEW BRIDE
I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY'RE NOT ENGAGED
BOSSES ARE HOW DO WE MOTIVATE THEM
THEY'RE NOT ENGAGED
YOU CAN'T LEAVE
MIKE ROWE AND THE WHOLE CAMPAIGN TO GIVE HONOR TO PEOPLE WHO ARE LABORERS IN DIRTY JOBS
SO THEY LIVE OUT THERE
HE RAN OUT OF MONEY
MAX YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE THERE FOREVER
AND UNDERSTANDING THAT MAKES WORKING TOGETHER EASIER AND IT MAKES BEING A FATHER EASIER
I THINK THIS IS GOING TO WORK
MY WIFE AND I WERE APART FROM EACH OTHER WHEN WE WERE ENGAGED FOR SIX MONTHS
IT'S YOUR FIRST JOB
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT 28 WITH A MORTGAGE AND A BABY
IT'S VERY SELECTIVE
THIS ONE MY FRIENDS IS A GAME CHANGER BECAUSE IF IT'S THE MILLENNIALS THEY'RE ARE A PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE
HALF OF THE FRUSTRATIONS MILLENNIALS HAVE ABOUT COMMUNICATING WITH THE OLDER GENERATIONS ABOUT WHAT THEY
IT'S A NEW LIFE STAGE
HALF OF WHAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT MILLENNIALS IS WRONG
WE SHOULD VALUE THAT AS AN ATHLETIC ACTIVITY IN AND OF ITSELF AND NOTHING TO HOW IT COMPARES TO PEOPLE WITHOUT
WE DON'T KNOW THAT THIS IS GOING TO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON BEES BUT WE'RE LOOKING INTO IT
I HOPE THAT YOU HAVE BECOME MORE INTERESTED IN BEES IN THIS TIME
SO WHAT ARE THEY
SOME FOOD CROPS SUCH AS THE ALMOND CROP IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IS
SO HONEY BEES ARE NOT AT RISK OF EXTINCTION PEOPLE LOVE HONEY BEES AND THEY WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP HONEYBEES AND EXPAND THEIR
SO IF WE CAN MAINTAIN THOSE TREE POPULATIONS PLANT MORE WE'RE CREATING HABITAT FOR BEES
WE HAVE A LOT OF TREES IN THE AREA
SO THERE'S A RISK THAT AS THE RANGE OF PLANTS CHANGE AND AS THE RANGE OF BEES CHANGE WE COULD BE
WHAT CAN WE DO
LAST YEAR IN FACT HAD ONE OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF COLONY LOSS IN RECORDED HISTORY WITH
PLANTS CAN'T MOVE THEY'RE ANCHORED INTO THE GROUND
THIS IS A HUGE ECONOMIC IMPACT
THE HONEY INDUSTRY ITSELF IS A BIG INDUSTRY WITH 1
WE HAVE GREAT TECHNICIANS WHO'VE WORKED OUT A LOT OF GREAT TECHNIQUES FOR FURTHER PROCESSING
AND JUST AS WITH THE WALL HOW I WANTED TO BE MORE WALL LIKE WITH THIS PROJECT I'D ACTUALLY LIKE TO TAKE MORE A OF GLACIAL
WE MAKE FIRE WE PLAY GAMES WE GO FOR EXPERIENCES SOMEWHERE OR WHAT ELSE WE BELIEVE WOULD BE FUN DOING
THAT WAY THE OVERALL PENALTY THAT INSTITUTIONS WOULD PAY SCALES ROUGHLY
AS STATE GOVERNMENTS STRUGGLE TO BALANCE THEIR BUDGETS STUDENTS ARE PICKING UP A LARGER SHARE OF THE TOTAL
AND IT'S GETTING MORE EXPENSIVE EVERY YEAR
IT'S A ONE FOLLOWED BY TWELVE ZEROS
WE GOT TO HAVE SOME SKIN IN THIS GAME
THAT'S A SUBTLE POINT
YOU REALLY ONLY HAVE TO KNOW THREE NUMBERS TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF FOR PROFITS IN THIS MESS
BUT THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE
NOW THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME STRONG SUPPORT FOR THIS IDEA
BUT OTHER COLLEGES MOST OTHERS WOULD DO THINGS LIKE STRETCHING OUT LOAN ELIGIBILITY FOR STUDENTS
MY NAME IS CHUCK WHITE AND I SERVE AS PRESIDENT OF WEBER STATE UNIVERSITY IN OGDEN UTAH
WELL SENATOR RICHARD DURBAN PUTS IT THIS WAY
BUT THOSE THAT DON'T WILL PAY MUCH MUCH MORE
BUT SOME INSTITUTIONS WOULD SHARE MUCH MORE PAIN THAN OTHERS
THE PERCENTAGE COULD BE EQUAL TO THAT COLLEGE'S THREE YEAR COHORT DEFAULT RATE AS PUBLISHED BY THE
WITHOUT STUDENT LOANS MANY STUDENTS MANY STUDENTS WOULD BE LOCKED OUT OF HIGHER ED ENTIRELY
COLLEGE IS EXPENSIVE
AND ULTIMATELY THE GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS OF THE UNITED STATES WOULD GO INTO A TAILSPIN
AND USING THIS THEY EVALUATED OVER A THOUSAND FEDERAL PROGRAMS
LET'S GRASP THE OPPORTUNITY THAT IS PRESENTED BY INNOVATION TO BUILD BETTER COMMUNITIES FOR
BUT UNFORTUNATELY THERE WASN'T EVER A WELL PUBLICIZED INCREASE IN FUNDING FOR THOSE PROGRAMS THAT DID
WHAT WE'VE FOUND IS ACTUALLY QUITE THE OPPOSITE
NOW WHY IS THAT STORY AND THAT APPROACH SO NOVEL
OVER 150 PROGRAMS HAD THEIR FUNDING REDUCED BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT DEMONSTRATE
THAT IS THE PATH TO A BETTER FUTURE FOR US ALL
THE GREENWOOD SECTION OF OUR CITY WAS KNOWN AS BLACK WALL STREET
AT THE DAWN OF THE 1920S TULSA WAS HOME TO THE MOST VIBRANT AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY IN THE COUNTRY
AND I AM USING THIS APPROACH IN TULSA
LET'S REPLACE A FOCUS ON PARTISAN DIVISION WITH A FOCUS ON
GIULIANI SHRUNK THAT TIME FRAME SO THAT CRIME STATISTICS WOULD BE COLLECTED ON A DAILY EVEN
WELL O'MALLEY LOVED THAT APPROACH AND HE APPLIED IT IN BALTIMORE
AND SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS THINK ABOUT HOW CAN WE CHANGE THAT DYNAMIC
AND I WAS THE UNDERDOG
AND A FUNNY THING HAPPENED WHEN WE DID THAT
I WAS RUNNING AGAINST A TWO TERM INCUMBENT AND MY OPPONENT RAN THE CLASSIC PARTISAN
BECAUSE THEY'RE REMINDERS THAT MIDNIGHT RUNS AREN'T PERMANENT SOLUTIONS THEY AREN'T INTENDED TO BE PERMANENT SOLUTIONS
I THINK A LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE TALKED TODAY HAVE ALREADY GIVEN GREAT EXAMPLES OF THAT AND I AM GOING TO ADD MY
SHE WAS HAVING HER PERIOD
BUT OVER TIME BECAUSE I DIDN'T AVOID THAT SENSE OF SHAME I LEARNT FROM IT
OH AND YOU FATHERS OUT THERE
TODAY HE SHUDDERS WITH EMBARRASSMENT WHENEVER WE BRING UP HIS CLOSE ASSOCIATION TO SOMETHING SO
WE ALLOW AND EVEN ENFORCE A DUALITY OR DOUBLE STANDARD
WE'VE INTERNALIZED THESE TRAITS WITH A CONCRETE MALE FEMALE ASSOCIATION ALTHOUGH THE TRAITS AND QUALITIES BELONGING TO
THIS SOCIAL DOMINANCE OF MASCULINITY IS KNOWN AS HEGEMONIC MASCULINITY
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY ECSTATIC AND SO PROUD OF MY ACHIEVEMENT YET I ONLY FELT PANIC
MALE LEADERS ARE STRONG POWERFUL AND DECISIVE YET A WOMAN IN THE SAME EXACT POSITION IS CONSIDERED A BITCH
WE SLUT SHAME GIRLS WHILE ADMIRING A MAN WHO IS A PLAYER
HE WAS OBSESSED AND WOULD DRESS ONLY IN THIS OUTFIT
NOW I'M A PRETTY TYPICAL 15 YEAR OLD GIRL I LIKE FASHION I SPEND TOO MUCH TIME ON MY PHONE AND I HAVE SEEN
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE I POSSESS BOTH MASCULINE AND FEMININE QUALITIES
IN 1991 PSYCHOLOGIST MONICA BIERNAT FOUND THAT CHILDREN DO NOT INITIALLY SEE MASCULINITY
I WENT TO MY FIRST COMMUNITY BOARD MEETING WHICH I'D NEVER BEEN TO ONE BEFORE AND SAT NEXT TO ANOTHER GUY
AND THE GOAL AT FIRST WAS JUST SAVING IT FROM DEMOLITION BUT THEN WE ALSO WANTED TO FIGURE OUT
BUT YOU SEE THAT HAPPENING ON THE HIGH LINE AND I THINK THAT'S THE POWER THAT PUBLIC SPACE CAN HAVE TO
AND FROM UP THERE ON A SMOG FREE DAY YOU CAN SEE ALL THE WAY TO THE ANGELES CREST ON ONE SIDE AND TO THE PACIFIC OCEAN
VANESSA REDGRAVE WAS STUMPED IN THE MOMENT
HONEY WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
I'M THEREFORE SURPRISED AND A LITTLE EMBARRASSED WHEN PEOPLE OFFER ME CONDOLENCES
MY HEAD MY WHOLE SELF WAS ALWAYS IN A BOOK
AND HIGH STAKES AND ROMANCE
I CHALKED IT UP TO HER PROFESSION
SHE TELLS A WHOPPER OF A LIE
YOU CANNOT HAVE ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER
WE WHO RESOLVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO EACH OTHER'S STORIES AND VISIONS AND
BUT THOUGH THE CRIME WAS THE CATALYST IT TURNS OUT NOT TO BE THE MAIN EVENT OF THE BOOK WHICH LIKE SO MANY IN THIS
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
WE HUMAN BEINGS WOE IS US WE HAVE THIS TWO PRONGED PROBLEM
I WAS PETER PAN AND WENDY
IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T APPRECIATE THE NATURAL WONDERS OF THE WORLD
THE QUESTION IS WHERE DOES THIS URGE COME FROM
WE LOVE STORIES DON'T WE
THERE'S ON DEMAND VIDEO FOR THAT
AND SO I'M PRETTY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT IT
WE HAVE THE TOOLS TO DO IT
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A PRETTY EXCITING TIME TO BE ALIVE
BUT WHAT IF THAT ESTIMATE IS JUST BASED ON YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE IN A NON MASTERY FRAMEWORK YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE WITH
STUDENTS SEE AN EXPLANATION AT THEIR OWN TIME AND PACE
BY THE TIME THEY GOT TO ALGEBRA THEY HAD SO MANY GAPS IN THEIR KNOWLEDGE THEY COULDN'T ENGAGE WITH IT
WHAT'S VARIABLE IS WHEN AND HOW LONG A STUDENT ACTUALLY HAS TO WORK ON SOMETHING AND WHAT'S FIXED IS THAT THEY
BUT NOW TODAY IT'S NO LONGER IMPRACTICAL
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO CONTRIBUTE
BECAUSE HE WAS AFRAID I WAS WALKING INTO A TRAP
BECAUSE THERE WAS NO MECHANISM IN THIS EXPLANATION FOR MAKING THIS STRUCTURE HARD
I'M NOT SURE THIS PROJECT'S GOING TO PAN OUT
IF THE WALL AROUND THE ERECTILE TISSUE WASN'T THERE IF IT WASN'T REINFORCED IN THIS
THEY'RE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE PENILE SKELETON
AND I THOUGHT YEAH HE DOES HAVE A REALLY GOOD POINT HERE
AND THAT WAS BECAUSE EVERY HYDROSTATIC SKELETON THAT WE HAD FOUND IN NATURE UP TO THAT POINT HAD THE SAME BASIC
SO I WENT AHEAD COLLECTED WALL TISSUE PREPARED IT SO IT WAS ERECT SECTIONED IT
AND NO ONE HAD SYSTEMATICALLY LOOKED AT THE WALL TISSUE
AND MY FIRST FORAYS INTO BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH DOING DINOSAUR PALEONTOLOGY AS AN UNDERGRADUATE
THEY USE A SKELETON THAT WE CALL A HYDROSTATIC SKELETON
IT'S GOING TO BE ON NOVEMBER 15TH AND THERE IS GOING TO BE A LIVE STREAM AND HOPEFULLY YOU
I'M TOO SCARED
AND THAT JUST LAUNCHED REALLY OFFICIALLY IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR AND THERE ARE ALREADY 12 OF THOSE TED ED CLUBS HERE IN
AND IT'S SO FUN TO WATCH THIS GROW AS A MOVEMENT AND THINK ABOUT HOW THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED WAS RIGHT
RIVES AND I WERE INVITED TO COME AND HOST
MANY OF US WILL WALK OUT OF HERE THINKING OF DOING SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT OR MAYBE HAVING A DIFFERENT LENS ON AN
WE PAIR UP EDUCATORS WITH ANIMATORS TO CREATE LESSONS AND TEACHERS
THEY GET INTERESTED IN SOMETHING
SETI ON THE OTHER HAND IS REALLY SIMPLE
TO BEGIN WITH IT'S GOING TO BE A SOCIETY THAT'S WAY IN ADVANCE OF OUR OWN
YOU'VE GOT TO GET THEM THERE
NOW I MIGHT BE AT GROUND ZERO FOR THIS
BUT HERE ARE A COUPLE THINGS I CAN SAY
OF EIGHT AND 11
SO THAT DOESN'T GET PEOPLE INTERESTED IN SCIENCE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T COMPREHEND WHAT IT'S ABOUT
THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT
I HAD BEEN BROUGHT IN TO TALK TO THESE KIDS FOR AN HOUR
YES TECHNOLOGICALLY IT'S VERY SOPHISTICATED BUT EVERYBODY GETS THE IDEA
I JUST WANDERED AROUND TAKING PHOTOS LIKE THIS ONE JUST FOR SOMETHING TO DO
I ALSO THINK THAT EXPLORATION IS IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO ADDRESS
I HAPPEN TO KNOW WHAT THE CONSEQUENCE FOR ME WOULD BE BECAUSE WE'VE HAD FALSE ALARMS
YOU DON'T GET ONE KITTEN
I TRY TO KEEP MY OWN FACE SOMEWHAT DISPASSIONATE
WHAT'S THE CONSEQUENCE
I USED TO TELL IT QUITE A LOT WHEN I WAS AT A DINNER PARTY
AND SURFING ON A WAVE SO IT IS POSSIBLE
I HAD A MONTH TO DO IT IN SO I DECIDED TO TAKE A MONTH OFF
40 MINUTES INTO THIS JOURNEY I SAW BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD A MAN
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS PROBABLY LOCAL BAVARIAN BEER
BY THIS POINT I'D BECOME A LITTLE BIT WELL KNOWN WITH THIS JOURNEY
WELL I'M DOING IT TO WIN A BET
BUT WE'VE ALREADY ESTABLISHED THAT THERE WAS NO ECONOMIC REASON FOR ME MAKING THIS JOURNEY
I BOUGHT MYSELF A HALF SIZE FRIDGE ONE THAT WOULD SIT IN SALOON CARS NICE AND EASILY
IT WAS VERY INTERESTING
WAS THAT GUY HITCHING WITH A FRIDGE
IT WAS QUITE UNUSUAL FOR THEM TO SEE A MAN COME IN WITH A FRIDGE ON A TROLLEY
LET ME EXPLAIN
IT BECOMES UGLY AND INACCURATE BECAUSE OUR THOUGHTS ARE FOOLISH BUT THE SLOVENLINESS OF OUR LANGUAGE
NEVER USE THE PASSIVE WHERE YOU CAN USE THE ACTIVE
THEY RESORT THEREFORE TO CAREFULLY PREPARED AND HIGHLY SPUN ONE LINERS OR TO STACCATO
A MAN MAY TAKE TO DRINK BECAUSE HE FEELS HIMSELF TO BE A FAILURE AND THEN FAIL ALL THE MORE COMPLETELY
EVEN OUR DEAR MONARCH HAS TO ENDURE THIS WHEN SHE READS OUT THE QUEEN'S SPEECH AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH SESSION OF
AND FINALLY A SIXTH RULE WHICH IS VERY VERY ORWELL
THE BEST YOU CAN HOPE FOR FROM THEM THESE DAYS ARE WHAT ARE KNOWN IN THE TRADE AS WELL REHEARSED
ORWELL ROUNDED OFF HIS CLASSIC ESSAY WITH SIX RULES WHICH IF I HAD MY WAY WOULD BE
NEVER USE A FOREIGN PHRASE A SCIENTIFIC WORD OR A JARGON WORD IF YOU CAN THINK OF AN EVERYDAY
I AM NOT A PESSIMIST THOUGH THAT'S HOW I MAY SOUND TO SOME OF YOU TODAY
GEORGE ORWELL WASN'T A PESSIMIST EITHER BACK IN 1946
IT IS RATHER THE SAME THING THAT'S HAPPENING TO THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE
JUSTICE WILL GO ASTRAY
HE WAS ALMOST AS HARD ON WESTERN GOVERNMENTS AND AUTHORS FOR THEIR SLOVENLY AND JARGON
ORWELL WENT ON
PHYSICISTS HAVE DEALT WITH THAT BY BASICALLY RELEGATING IT TO THE MICRO REALM AND SAYING THE WORLD STILL WORKS
IT'S A RELATIVELY NEW PHENOMENON
ALL OF THEM AGREED ON WHAT IT WAS TO EXIST
AND HE ASKED HIS NAME
SO WE'RE MOVING INTO A DIFFERENT STORY A DIFFERENT STORY OF SELF A DIFFERENT STORY OF THE WORLD A DIFFERENT STORY
NOW WE MUST TRY THE IMPOSSIBLE
AND THIS STORY IS CHANGING TODAY
WELL NOW SOMEONE IS
ECONOMICS YOU ARE A RATIONAL ACTOR SEEKING TO MAXIMIZE FINANCIAL SELF INTEREST
IT'S NOT EASY IT'S NOT LIKE A NORMAL WHITE BREAD WHERE YOU JUST CAN THROW EVERYTHING TOGETHER
YOU DON'T WANT TO DRINK A RIESLING WITH EVERYTHING RIGHT
SO THIS IS MY IDEA WORTH SPREADING
HIS RESEARCH SHOWED THAT YOU COULD REDUCE THE MORTALITY RATES FROM SEPTICEMIA FROM
AND THE HEALTHY DIET IS ONE THAT IS FRESH HIGH IN FRUITS AND VEGETABLES
WHEN PEOPLE GET WELL THEY GET WELL ACROSS THE BOARD NOT ONLY IN THE SYMPTOMS THAT WE TREATED
HOW DO WE EXPLAIN THIS
YOU KNOW GIVE US A GO
WE DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT
THAT WAS A CHALLENGE WE HAD TO FACE AS PHYSICISTS
AND EVEN THE VERY RICH SO HENRY VIII FOR EXAMPLE RECYCLED HIS CLOTHING AND TAILORED THEM AND CHANGED THEM AS FASHIONS
AND REMNANTS OF HAT HONOUR STILL EXIST TODAY SO A MAN GOING INTO CHURCH OR ATTENDING A FUNERAL WILL GENERALLY REMOVE HIS HAT
HOWEVER WE DO STILL FACE SOME UNSPOKEN SOCIETAL CUSTOMS SO THE MALE BUSINESS SUIT WHICH IS
JUST RECENTLY BECAME A HARD CIDER MAKER
IN A FUTURE NON HOMOPHOBIC SOCIETY AS THE TABOOS AROUND SAME SEX
THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE I DO BELIEVE WILL BE OPEN TO THE POSSIBILITY OF BOTH OPPOSITE
PEOPLE WILL NO LONGER FEEL THE NEED TO LABEL THEMSELVES AS GAY OR STRAIGHT
AS WE KNOW FROM PSYCHOLOGY MANY PEOPLE HAVE HIDDEN UNCONSCIOUS DESIRES
AS WE EVOLVE TO A MORE SEXUALLY ENLIGHTENED AND ACCEPTING SOCIETY
THAT WAS IN 1959
THERE WERE ACTUALLY 89 PARTICIPANTS 89 TEAMS THAT CAME TO PARTICIPATE THIS COMPETITION
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT YOU DRIVE IN TODAY YOU HAD A VEHICLE THAT HAD A COMPUTER CONTROLLED ENGINE AND COMPUTER CONTROLLED
SO WE ARE IN THE AGE
ONE IN PARTICULAR THE ONE AT THE BOTTOM IS CALLED THE SYCLONE
IT'S IN THE ROCKIES
WE'RE ON TWICE A DAY ON THE DISCOVERY WE CAN'T DO THIS
AND HE SAYS OSHA
HE'S GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT HE SPENDS HIS DAYS DOING THIS INCREDIBLE SERVICE AND HE SMELLS LIKE HELL BUT GOD BLESS HIM
IT WAS IMPRESSIVE
HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE THEIR BLACKBERRY
THE WAY WE PORTRAY WORKING PEOPLE ON TV IT'S LAUGHABLE
GOOD GRIEF NOT TO THIS CROWD
I MEAN THAT'S ALL I HEARD GROWING UP
AND I'M UP TO MY NECK IN ANAGNORISES EVERY SINGLE DAY
IT'S PROBABLY THE WORST ADVICE I EVER GOT
I ALWAYS WATCH THE PROCESS DONE THE FIRST TIME BEFORE I TRY IT
ALBERT HANDS ME THE KNIFE
HE SAID WELL THAT'S HOW WE DO IT
I SAID STOP
IT'S A COLD WAR REALLY
IT CAN'T BE REPEATED ON ANY FACTORY FLOOR OR ANY CONSTRUCTION SITE
AS A GROUP THEY'RE THE HAPPIEST PEOPLE I KNOW
THAT'S WHAT TV DOES
MATT FREUND A DAIRY FARMER IN NEW CANAAN CONNECTICUT WHO WOKE UP ONE DAY AND REALIZED THE CRAP FROM HIS
WE'RE PLUGGED IN WE'RE CONNECTED
I STARTED TO LOOK AT TEAMWORK AND DETERMINATION
AND I WAS REMINDED HOW UTTERLY WRONG I AM SO MUCH OF THE TIME
I'M AN APPRENTICE AND I WORK WITH THE PEOPLE WHO DO THE JOBS IN QUESTION
THERE'S NO WRITING THERE'S NO SCRIPTING THERE'S NO NONSENSE
OH I'M DEAD
AND I TALK TO HIM
BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH PROTEIN IN THE STUFF WE DON'T EAT HIS PIGS GROW AT TWICE THE NORMAL SPEED AND HE'S ONE RICH PIG FARMER
MEANWHILE WE'VE GOT TWO TRILLION DOLLARS AT A MINIMUM ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF CIVIL ENGINEERS THAT WE NEED TO
GREAT GOT IT
THEY LOOK LIKE THUMBS COMING RIGHT AT YOU
AND HE SAYS BITE EM
MOST HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENT I'D EVER SEEN AND I WAS BACK WITH A GUY LASHING THE POTS DOWN
IT'S WHAT OUR NETWORK DOES IT'S WHAT DIRTY JOBS IS
HE'S MAKING A GREAT LIVING
OH I'M LIVING IN A COMPUTER PROGRAM
IN THESE PAGES HE WROTE THE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTAL PHRASE OF WESTERN PHILOSOPHY
THEY DO THINGS THAT MOST PEOPLE THINK ARE IMPOSSIBLE
THERE IS PEOPLE DOING AMAZING THINGS WE DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT
POSSIBLY PROBABLY NOT
WE DON'T KNOW
IT'S DARK BECAUSE IT INTERACTS SO SLIGHTLY WITH OUR EVERYDAY ELECTROMAGNETIC WORLD THAT IT'S EFFECTIVELY BEEN HIDDEN FROM ALL
I'VE NO IDEA WHAT THE DISCOVERY OF A DARK PHOTON WILL MEAN BEYOND EXPANDING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNIVERSE
ONE WAY IS IF THE PARTICLES ARE SUPER MASSIVE
IS THIS WHAT WE SAID TO EACH OTHER
IT IS AMAZINGLY SUCCESSFUL BUT IT CANNOT BE THE COMPLETE PICTURE OF NATURE AT ITS FUNDAMENTAL SCALES
IT ABSOLUTELY HAS TO HAPPEN THIS IS BEING PLANNED
BUT IT IS NOW WEAKER THAN IT HAS BEEN AT ANY POINT SINCE WORLD WAR II ALL OF THE CRISES THE
THERE ARE REAL LEADERS ACROSS ASIA THEY HAVE A LOT OF POLITICAL STABILITY
WE CAN STILL BE THAT CHEERLEADER ON VALUES
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH TURKEY WOULD LOVE TO HAVE NEIGHBORS LIKE THAT
DOES THE ENTIRE MIDDLE EAST FALL APART
THROUGH OUR CELL PHONES INDIVIDUALLY WE HAVE THOSE VOICES TO COMPEL THEM TO CHANGE
WE SEE IT WITH THE OPENNESS IN CUBA
LET'S SEND OUR KIDS TO AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES
WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT ANYMORE
LET'S GO NEW YORK REAL ESTATE
NUMBER TWO IT WAS EASY TO TAKE A LOT OF CHEAP MONEY OUT OF THE GROUND BECAUSE OIL WAS
ABE WHO IS PROBABLY ABOUT TO GET A THIRD TERM WRITTEN IN IN THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN JAPAN OF COURSE XI
ASIA ACTUALLY LOOKS A LOT BETTER
AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY DOING
THE RUSSIANS ARE PICKING UP THE CRUMBS
THEY HAD BEEN MORE OPPOSED TO THE UNITED STATES FOR DECADES
WE WILL SEE IT IN VENEZUELA WHEN MADURO FALLS
YOU DON'T LIKE IT LUMP IT
SO YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO SEE AN EXTREME SEGREGATION GOING ON BETWEEN THE WINNERS AND THE LOSERS ACROSS
I MEAN THE TURKS WOULD LOVE TO HAVE ONLY 10000 SYRIAN REFUGEES
IF WE KNOW WE DON'T WANT TO BE THE GLOBAL COP ANYMORE IF WE KNOW WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE THE ARCHITECT OF GLOBAL TRADE
THEY'RE THERE FOR A WHILE
NO THE KURDS WILL DO BETTER AND IRAQ ISRAEL IRAN OVER TIME
IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THAT WAY
WE CAN STILL BE THE ARCHITECT OF GLOBAL TRADE
THOSE COUNTRIES CAN FALL OFF THE MAP
YOU KNOW OUR NEIGHBORS ARE AWESOME CANADA MEXICO AND TWO BIG BODIES OF WATER
WE PRODUCE ALL THAT RIGHT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES
IT WAS 90 MINUTES LONG AND THEY TALKED ABOUT SYRIA
THAT'S WHAT PUTIN WANTED TO TALK ABOUT
WE WANT TO EMULATE THEM
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF MUTUAL LIKE OR TRUST BUT IT'S NOT AS IF THE AMERICANS ARE TELLING HIM WHAT
WE JUST ACCEPTED 10000 SYRIAN REFUGEES AND WE'RE COMPLAINING BITTERLY ABOUT IT
NOW LOOK THERE ARE PROBLEMS IN ASIA
HE'S BEEN PROFILED IN THE NEW YORK TIMES HE'S BEEN WRITTEN UP TWICE IN ESQUIRE
WE CAN ALL UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THAT
HE'S A JOURNALIST
SO WHEN HE DECIDED TO GO BACK AND GET HIS DOCTORATE IN BIOMATHEMATICS HE ALREADY
BUT WHAT THIS TEACHES US IS THAT REAL INNOVATION VERY RARELY
SOME ARE GOVERNED BY THEIR HEART THEIR PASSION
ISN'T THERE ANY EASIER WAY
SHE WENT TO COLLEGE AND SHE STUDIED DEVELOPMENT AND SHE GOT A JOB WORKING IN NGOS AFTER SHE
AND THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE
LITERALLY TENURED PROFESSORS AT IVY LEAGUE UNIVERSITIES WOULD STORM OUT OF HIS LECTURES AND SAY DON'T
BUT IT WASN'T ALWAYS THAT WAY
ERIC ACTUALLY DIDN'T START OUT IN BIOLOGY
HE GOT HIS MASTER'S DEGREE IN PURE MATHEMATICS
WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH A SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENT
WELL NEW RESEARCH JUST CAME OUT 13 SECONDS AGO THAT SHOWS A WHOLE NEW APPROACH TO THAT AND A NEW WAY TO TAKE GLUTATHIONE
I'LL BE ABLE TO ACCESS THAT IN THE CLOUD
AND JENNINGS AND THE OTHER GUY DIDN'T GET THAT
THAT MAY WORK IT MAY NOT BUT IF IT DOES IT WILL REMEMBER THAT AND HAVE A NEW BEHAVIOR AND THAT CAN ACTUALLY SPREAD VIRALLY
NO OTHER SPECIES HAS DONE THAT
BUT THE FRONTAL CORTEX IS NOT REALLY QUALITATIVELY DIFFERENT
IT'S A QUANTITATIVE EXPANSION OF NEOCORTEX BUT THAT ADDITIONAL QUANTITY OF THINKING WAS THE
IT'S A PRETTY SOPHISTICATED EXAMPLE OF COMPUTERS ACTUALLY UNDERSTANDING HUMAN LANGUAGE AND IT ACTUALLY GOT ITS KNOWLEDGE BY READING
WE CAN SEE YOUR BRAIN CREATE YOUR THOUGHTS
WE CAN SEE YOUR THOUGHTS CREATE YOUR BRAIN WHICH IS REALLY KEY TO HOW IT WORKS
YOU'RE PROBABLY IN THE FRONTAL CORTEX AND YOU'LL HAVE MODULES THAT SAY THAT WAS IRONIC
IF I HAD TO PLACE IT ON AN ARBITRARY SPECTRUM I'D SAY IT FALLS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN POETRY AND LIES
BUT NOT SO WITH M RQUEZ WHO ONCE PRAISED HIS TRANSLATOR'S VERSIONS AS BEING BETTER THAN HIS OWN
NOW LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE FROM MY ACT
WHICH STRUCK ME AS PARTICULARLY REMARKABLE DURING ONE SESSION WITH THE NOVEL WHEN I REALIZED THAT I WAS BEING SWEPT
PEOPLE CAN'T WAIT TO PASS ALONG THAT NEW GREAT JOKE
BUT BACK IN 2009 THE QUESTION JOEL AND I KEPT TURNING OVER AND OVER WAS WHY THIS LATE IN THE GAME
TIME AFTER TIME WHENEVER I SET OUT TO SHARE SOME GREAT TRUTH WITH A SOON TO BE GRATEFUL RECIPIENT
I WAS VISITING WITH JOEL THE WEEKEND BEFORE THE COPENHAGEN CONFERENCE ON CLIMATE CHANGE OPENED IN DECEMBER OF
IT TAKES THE BASE METAL OF OUR CONVENTIONAL WISDOM AND TRANSFORMS IT THROUGH RIDICULE INTO A DIFFERENT
AND THERE'S THIS MENTAL DELIGHT THAT'S FOLLOWED BY THE PHYSICAL RESPONSE OF LAUGHTER WHICH NOT COINCIDENTALLY
AND GUESS WHAT
THERE ARE FEW PHRASES THAT PACK A MORE CONCENTRATED DOSE OF SUBJECT AND SYMBOL THAN THE PERFECT
COMEDY HAS BEEN CROSSING COUNTRY WITH REMARKABLE SPEED WAY BEFORE THE INTERNET SOCIAL MEDIA
AND HE USED TO BE THE USA TODAY MONDAY MORNING GUY
I HAVE SOME MATERIAL ABOUT THE SO CALLED RADICAL GAY AGENDA WHICH STARTS OFF BY ASKING HOW RADICAL
BECAUSE FROM WHAT I CAN TELL THE THREE THINGS GAY AMERICANS SEEM TO WANT MOST ARE TO JOIN THE MILITARY GET MARRIED AND
WHY IS THIS REMOTELY CONTROVERSIAL
IT'S PART OF OUR SURVIVAL PACKAGE AND THAT'S WHY IT'S BECOME SO IMPORTANT FOR US AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE
THE DESCRIPTION PERFECTLY CAPTURED EDWARDS' PERSONAL VANITY
AND I HEARD THE EXACT SAME PUNCHLINE ON BOTH COASTS SOMETHING ABOUT THE IGNITED NEGRO COLLEGE
AND NOT LONG AFTER THAT HE GOT ANOTHER REQUEST FOR A COPY FROM THE HEAD OF THE EPA IN CALIFORNIA WHO USED
INTERESTINGLY WHEN YOUR OPENING LINE OF COMMUNICATION IS HEY LISTEN UP BECAUSE I'M ABOUT TO DROP SOME SERIOUS KNOWLEDGE ON
IT'S HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR ANYONE WHO'S INTERESTED IN THE TRANSLATOR'S ART
EVER SINCE I CAN REMEMBER THINKING CONSCIOUSLY ABOUT SUCH THINGS COMMUNICATION HAS BEEN MY CENTRAL PASSION
EVEN AS A CHILD I REMEMBER THINKING THAT WHAT I REALLY WANTED MOST IN LIFE WAS TO BE ABLE TO
AND EARLIER THIS YEAR HE GOT A REQUEST FROM THE GREEN PARTY IN AUSTRALIA WHO USED IT IN THEIR CAMPAIGN
TWO DAYS AFTER THAT
PROBABLY ALL OF US KNOW WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE THESE DAYS
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE STATE OF MAINE THAT WAS THE FIRST TO PASS A
YOUTUBE FACEBOOK TWITTER
IF YOU'RE A TEENAGER TODAY AND YOU'RE WALKING BY A MCDONALD'S YOU MIGHT JUST GET A TEXT MESSAGE PROMOTION FOR A BIG
SO YOU MIGHT THINK WELL OK SO THE ANSWER'S SIMPLE
73 OF TEENAGERS ARE NOW ON SOME SOCIAL MEDIA SITE
I'M SEEING PROOF OF THAT EVERYWHERE I GO
I'M NOT JUST HERE TO TELL YOU HOW UPSET AS A PARENT I AM
THERE ARE SITES LIKE RONALD
THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY
COM WHICH IS MCDONALD'S SITE JUST FOR PRESCHOOLERS
THE FOOD INDUSTRY IS ON ALL OF THESE PLATFORMS
THERE ARE NOW DOZENS OF WEBSITES OUT THERE DESIGNED FOR KIDS BY FOOD COMPANIES WITH FREE
THEY'RE SAYING WELL WE'RE MARKETING TO KIDS LESS WE'RE DOING IT LESS
IT WAS THE KIND OF OBSESSION THAT HAD HER FAKING INJURIES JUST SO SHE COULD WEAR THEM
THERE'S LOTS OF OTHER THINGS THEY'RE DOING
IF A CHILD WATCHES A TYPICAL AMOUNT OF TELEVISION EVERY YEAR THEY WILL NOW BE SEEING
WHERE SHOULD I BE ROWING NOW
AND I LET GO OF SOMETHING INSIDE OF ME AND FELT RELIEVED
I'M STILL WAITING FOR
LET'S HOPE IT HAPPENS BEFORE I'M GONE
YOU HAVE TO PLACE YOUR FOOT CAREFULLY
YOU HAVE TO CONCENTRATE
I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT TED
AND WHEN THE TIME HAS COME TOWARDS THE END OF THE PREGNANCY THE BABY DECIDES
OR DOES SOMEBODY WANT TO RUN A MARATHON OR DOES SOMEBODY WANT TO BALLROOM DANCE
HOW WOULD YOU WANT TO ENHANCE A HUMAN BODY
SHE TOOK MY HEART
PAUL KALANITHI CALLED WHEN BREATH BECOMES AIR
THINK ABOUT WHY YOUR LIFE IS MEANINGFUL
TALK TO YOUR KIDS ABOUT WHAT GRIEF MIGHT LOOK LIKE
IN THE BOOK HE WROTE ABOUT HIS EXPERIENCE IN DEALING WITH PATIENTS WHO ARE DYING
I PROMISE THAT'S NOT THE CASE
RECENTLY I READ A BOOK BY DR
SHOULDN'T WE BE TALKING ABOUT THIS STUFF AND LEARNING HOW TO DEAL WITH IT
DO YOU TRY TO RESCUE THEM FROM THEIR BAD FEELINGS BY SAYING THINGS LIKE OH AT LEAST HE
I'M ASKING YOU TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT
I'LL SUSPEND JUDGEMENT
SO WHAT'S ACTUALLY INVOLVED IN TAKING EACH OTHER SERIOUSLY
ONLY BY SHIFTING REGISTER INTO THE ARGUMENTATIVE PERSPECTIVE CAN ANYONE BE CONVINCED OF ANYTHING
YOU MIGHT MEAN
MORALITY THEY SAY IS LIKE ICE CREAM
WE ALL WANT JUSTICE EVEN IF WE DISAGREE ABOUT WHAT IT MIGHT MEAN
AND THE QUESTION THE SUPREME COURT NEEDED TO ANSWER WAS
AND EVEN THOUGH WE MAY AND OUGHT TO DISAGREE WITH THEM WE SHOULDN'T DO IT FROM A POSTURE OF ARROGANCE
THAT QUESTION IS AMBIGUOUS
I'VE GOT AN AMAZING JOB
I THINK A LOT OF OUR DEBATES ABOUT POLITICS ARE KIND OF LIKE THE DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER FREE SPEECH PROTECTS HATE
I WONT DO ANYTHING
THEY'RE REALLY GOOD ARGUMENTS ON BOTH SIDES
AND UNLESS WE DO A BETTER JOB OF DOING THIS OUR POLITICS ISN'T GOING TO BE AS HEALTHY OR AS
A LOT OF THE DISAGREEMENTS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR DEMOCRACIES ARE DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT THE BEST INTERPRETATION OF A SHARED
DEMOCRACY IS SO MUCH MORE THAN VOTING
EVERY YEAR WHEN I TEACH FREE SPEECH I TALK ABOUT A FAMOUS SUPREME COURT CASE FROM THE YEAR
ON THE OTHER HAND HOW COULD THE NAZIS INVOKE THE IDEAL OF FREEDOM TO JUSTIFY THE EXPRESSION OF A
THEY'RE DISAGREEMENTS THAT PEOPLE HERE PROBABLY HAVE WITH ONE ANOTHER
THINK ABOUT TRUCK DRIVERS WHO SUPPORT CONSERVATIVE POLITICIANS AND ARE THEN TOLD THEY'VE BEEN BRAINWASHED INTO DOING THAT BY
LET'S CALL THE FIRST THE EXPLANATORY PERSPECTIVE
AND JUST AS WE WOULD NOT WANT OTHERS TO GIVE UP ON US HAD WE BEEN UNLUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE BEEN BORN INTO
BUT THE SECOND PERSPECTIVE WE CAN CALL IT THE ARGUMENTATIVE PERSPECTIVE' SEES PEOPLE AS WHAT PHILOSOPHERS CALL
PEOPLE OF GOOD FAITH WITH COMPARABLE INTELLIGENCE REASONING AS HARD AS THEY CAN NEVERTHELESS COME TO
WE THINK THEY'VE GOTTEN THE TRUTH ABOUT JUSTICE WRONG
AND I'VE LEARNED SOMETHING REALLY IMPORTANT
THE DISAGREEMENTS I'VE BEEN THINKING OF TODAY ARE DISAGREEMENTS THAT DIVIDE MANY DEMOCRATIC SOCIETIES
THINK OF PEOPLE WHO OPPOSE INCREASED IMMIGRATION ON THE GROUNDS THAT THEY THINK IT BURDENS NATIVE WORKERS ECONOMICALLY
YOU MIGHT MEAN ONE OF TWO THINGS
WHAT SHOULD I DECIDE TO DO
WHEN WE ASK OURSELVES WHAT IS IT FOR A SOCIETY OR FOR A WORLD TO BE JUST WE GIVE TOTALLY DIFFERENT
WE DISAGREE ABOUT JUSTICE
PEOPLE WHO ARE AUTHORS OF THEIR OWN THOUGHTS WHO HAVE THE CAPACITY TO REFLECT ON WHAT IS RIGHT AND TRUE
WE DISAGREE ABOUT THE ROLE OF RELIGION IN POLITICS
BUT YOU MIGHT ALSO THINK
WHY SHOULD HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS HAVE TO PUT UP WITH SUCH HATRED SUCH AN ASSAULT ON THEIR EQUAL
WHITES WERE LARGELY UNSCATHED
BUT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT ENDURING AND DISPARATE RATES AND THE
IN 1994 HE WAS HEAD OF THE UN PEACEKEEPING DEPARTMENT
WORKING SIDE BY SIDE WITH BRILLIANT ZIMBABWEANS SCIENTISTS DOCTORS ACTIVISTS
YOU'VE PROBABLY FELT SOMETHING EVERY TIME I'VE SAID IT
THAT'S WHY SOUNDING THE ALARM ABOUT THE IMPACT OF RACISM ON HEALTH IN THE
A MASSIVE EXPANSION OF RURAL HEALTH CENTERS PLACED ROUGHLY 80 PERCENT OF THE
INFECTION RATE STOOD AT ABOUT TWO PERCENT IN MY EARLY DAYS THERE
THESE WOULD SOAR TO ONE OUT OF EVERY FOUR ADULTS BY THE TIME I
I WAS PROVIDING EXCELLENT TREATMENT SUCH AS IT WAS
REAL TIME DATA
AND HIS PROOF POINT WAS SO POWERFUL THAT AFTER HE DID THAT A GENERATION OF PILOTS AFTER HIM
WE HAD FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIERS WE HAD US ARMY SOLDIERS AND US MARINES ALONG
AND THAT PERSON WAS ME
WE HAD TO GET GOOD QUALITY IMAGES FROM WHICH TO MAKE THE CAD MODEL
WE DON'T NEED ANY OF THAT
YOU HAVE AN EQUIVALENT IN POLAND NO DOUBT
FOUR AND A HALF HOURS ON THE TABLE AND EVERYTHING WAS DONE
WELL THE ANSWER TO THAT IS A MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM
BECAUSE HE IS SO SUCCESSFUL
THEY'VE REALLY GOT TO START TALKING TO EACH OTHER AND EXERCISE A BIT OF IMAGINATION IF THAT'S NOT TOO MUCH TO ASK
SO ONE NEEDS TO BE CAREFUL WITH DISCIPLINARY CONVENTIONS
HE OPENS YOU UP HE ACCESSES THE AORTA WHILE YOUR HEART IS BEATING ALL AT THE RIGHT TEMPERATURE
SO IT REALLY IS GREAT
THE PROJECT AIM IS REALLY QUITE SIMPLE
AND SOME PEOPLE ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN SPORTS
SO THINGS LIKE BEES AND STUFF LIKE THAT
YOU CAN SEE SOME OTHER PATTERNS EMERGED HERE
BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT THEY CLUSTER TOGETHER
OH YEAH I AGREE
EVERYBODY IS SORT OF INTERESTED IN SPORTS
AND I THINK WHAT IT REALLY BOILS DOWN TO IS MAPS
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY VERY HELPFUL FOR UNDERSTANDING THE GEOGRAPHY OF A PLACE LIKE ISTANBUL OR FIGURING OUT HOW TO GET FROM
THIS IS SAN FRANCISCO
I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A CASE
I MEAN HOW CAN WE DO THOSE WITHOUT WORDS
IT DOESN'T JUST REPLACE THE WORDS
WHAT WOULD THEY SAY ABOUT YOU
WE ALL KNOW HOW TO SHOW UP WELL WHEN WE WANT TO
THINK ABOUT THAT
WE KNOW HOW TO DO THAT SO YOU CAN FAKE THAT
WHAT DO YOU ROCK AT
ARE YOU REALLY LISTENING
0 HOW DO YOU GET TO 1
WE WANT OUR LANGUAGE BACK
YOU ARE A REASON TO WAKE UP EVERY MORNING YOU ARE A REASON TO WAKE UP EVERY MORNING THAT'S WHY I OFFER YOU THIS
FOR ALL OF THE TIMES I HAD TO LEARN HOW TO OFFER MYSELF BACK TO MYSELF
YOU ALREADY CAN'T VOTE WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT YOU'RE ALLOWED TO LIVE HERE
THOSE PEOPLE WHO MAKE YOU SAD ALL THE TIME ARE NOT YOUR FRIENDS DARLING
I THINK IT CAN
WHO'S GOT THEIR BACK
WHAT HAPPENED THEN
PLAY WITH PEOPLE WHO MAKE YOU HAPPY
PLAY WITH PEOPLE WHO MAKE YOU HAPPY
WE REALIZED THAT SHE WAS BEING BULLIED
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
AND WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS
ONE OF MY FIRST CREATIVE WRITING TEACHERS TOLD ME THAT WHAT I WAS WRITING WASN'T POETRY AND TO CHANGE IT
I NEEDED TO HEAD TOWARDS CONSERVATION GOALS
JUST GET WHATEVER ANYBODY WANTS
NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA
THESE ARE THE VARIABLE ASPECTS
ANNA ON THE OTHER HAND WAS THE MOTHER OF TWO YOUNG CHILDREN
YOU MIGHT SAY THAT NONSTANDARD LIKE IS ALL OVER THE PLACE
FIRST OF ALL WE CAN'T STOP LANGUAGE CHANGING
AND WORD ORDER IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS
HOWEVER THERE ARE MANY ASPECTS OF LANGUAGE WHERE WE DO HAVE A CHOICE
BUT FOR THE MOMENT SINCE WE HAVE FOUND NO EVIDENCE FOR NEW PHENOMENA LET US SUPPOSE
BUT THIS STORY IS FAR MORE INTERESTING THAN THAT
JUST LOOK AT THE SURFACE
IT WAS REMARKABLE
IT TOOK ABOUT ONE MINUTE
AND THEY MASTURBATED
IT'S TIME TO RE CONNECT WITH WATER
ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN
PLASTICS OFFER ABOUT ONCE OR TWICE OF RECYCLING WHETHER IT'S A BOTTLE WHETHER IT'S A CHAIR WHATEVER IT IS IF
AND WHAT YOU CAN DO THEN IS THE MILK OR THE BACTERIA PRODUCE IN MUCH LARGER VOLUMES AND THEN
WHY IS THAT INTERESTING
DESIGN IN THE ABILITY FOR IT TO BE TAKEN APART
WE USED TO BE GOOD AT THRIFTING
TURNS OUT THERE'S A COMPANY CALLED LAND DETECTOR THAT'S ACTUALLY WORKING IN CHINA AND ALSO SOON IN SOUTH AFRICA THAT'S ABLE
IT'S THE WATER BOTTLE
IN LIGHT OF THESE TRENDS
AND HOW WILL THEY TRANSFORM OUR SOCIAL STRUCTURES
WITH A GROWING MIDDLE CLASS AND A WEALTH OF RESOURCES THAT ARE FAST MAKING IT A VIABLE MARKET FOR A NEW
WE MUST DARE INVEST IN THE FUTURE OF AFRICA
SO WHY TO ENGAGE IN DIALOGUE
THE FIRST ONE IS SOCIAL
BUT I'M ALSO GOING TO GIVE YOU A PERSONAL MORE INDIVIDUAL REASON
AND I WOULD LIKE TO QUALIFY THAT IDEA
SO THEN MY IDEA WAS OK SO WHAT IF I TRIED TO BRING PHILOSOPHY
SO I THOUGHT HE'S OUR GUY
SO THAT'S HOW WE SHOULD RELATE TO OTHERS
AT THE ABBE MUSEUM WE WORK DAILY TO QUESTION OUR OPERATIONAL CHOICES OUR STRATEGIC
ONE OF THEM HAPPENED TO BE ME NOW
BUT WHO IS TO BE BLAMED
THEY WILL DIE SOON
SO WE PARTY AND DANCE TO THEIR MUSIC
I THOUGHT I WAS FAMOUS ENOUGH THAT I WOULD RAISE THE MONEY WITHIN ONE MONTH BUT I'VE BEEN HUMBLED
I WANTED TO REVENGE FOR MY VILLAGE
I WAS READY TO EAT
I KNOW IT'S A SHAME
AND IF YOU HAVE THE MONEY ELON MUSKS'S COMPANY SPACEX WILL FROM NEXT YEAR FLY
FROM CROWDED CARRIAGEWAYS AND AROUND DINNER TABLES WHEN TIMES GET TOUGH WE
YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER ALL THE FACTORS IN ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES BEFORE CONSIDERING YOURSELF A FAILURE IN COMPARISON TO
SHE STAYED TRUE TO WHO SHE WAS NO MATTER WHAT THE WHOLE WORLD WAS TELLING HER SHE WAS
AS A RESULT THE SECOND COMPONENT IS COMMON HUMANITY WHICH INVOLVES ELIMINATING THE MENTALITY
DEVELOPING THESE THREE COMPONENTS OF SELF COMPASSION HAS SHOWN TO BE IMMENSELY BENEFICIAL AS MENTIONED BY
HUMILIATION IS AN EMOTION FELT BY EVERY SINGLE PERSON NO MATTER THEIR RACE THEIR
THEY COULDN'T SEE THE PERSON I TRULY WAS
HOWEVER IF WE FIND OURSELVES BEING THE VICTIMS OF SUCH LABELS REMEMBER THAT WE DO HAVE THE POWER TO
THE THIRD COMPONENT IS MINDFULNESS
AS THE TIME PASSED I BEGAN TO ASK MYSELF
I FOUND THAT EMPOWERMENT THROUGH SELF COMPASSION
HUMANS TEND TO EXAGGERATE THEIR FAILURES AND CRITICIZE THEMSELVES MORE
S WANT TO TALK AND FLIRT WITH THE FEMALE C
THEY PLAY THE LITTLE HIGH SCHOOL KID GAMES WITH EACH OTHER
FAMILY INDEPENDENCE INITIATIVE IS A PLATFORM
BRIANNA WAS STRUGGLING IN SCHOOL
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT MY OWN BLIND SPOT
I ALMOST LOST SIGHT OF MY OWN POWER
FOR MY FAMILY SOCIAL CONNECTIONS WERE KEY TO MOVING FROM POVERTY TOWARDS
IF YOU'RE NOT TOO BAD
WE USE GAME DYNAMICS TO BUILD ON IT
THEY SHOULD RECOGNIZE THEY'VE BUILT AN APPOINTMENT DYNAMIC AND LEVERAGE THE GAMES
WHY NOT LEVEL UP
THAT'S REALLY REALLY POWERFUL
WHY HAVE GAMES YOU CAN LOSE
PROGRESSION IS POWERFUL
AND THAT'S A VERY POWERFUL THING
WHY GO FROM AN A TO AN F OR A B TO A C
WE BUILD WITH MINDSHARE
THEN YOU CAN REALLY ACHIEVE GOOD IN SOME INTERESTING WAYS
AND THAT'S VERY POWERFUL TO ME
AND IF YOU'RE HAPPY WITH THAT FANTASTIC
STATUS IS REALLY GOOD MOTIVATOR
THEY'RE NOT VERY WELL DESIGNED
HOPEFULLY FOR GOOD
I SEE THAT HABIT
BLIND LEADING THE BLIND
WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW IS TO PAY ATTENTION
I WOULD SEE MEN
THEY LOOKED LIKE MY DAD
WHAT IS A MEMORY
AND LET NO IMMIGRANTS IN ANYMORE BUILD A WALL
IN THE SECOND THEY HAD TO PUT HALF OF IT BACK
WHY WOULD SOMEBODY NOT RECYCLE
THINK ABOUT THIS
THIS MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE QUESTION
IT'S AN IMPORTANT SKILL SET
AND THAT NIGHT MANY NEARBY VILLAGES DID THE SAME AND WHEN THE WARDENS CAME THIS TIME THEY THREW UP THEIR
WITH THIS VICTORY THE VILLAGERS GAINED CONFIDENCE AND ONCE AGAIN BEGAN TO PASS ON THEIR TRADITIONS TO THEIR
FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE I KNEW HOW VALUABLE RITES OF PASSAGE WERE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE
ONE OF THE BEST SUPPORTS THAT CAME TO ME WAS WHEN I WAS ABLE TO GO OUT OF DISTRICT
I WENT TO PUBLIC SCHOOL FROM 1ST TO 4TH GRADE AND THEN FROM 5TH TO HIGH
IT'S LIKE HOW HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE
WHEN I WAS ABLE TO GO OUT OF DISTRICT I WAS ABLE TO FOR THE FIRST TIME REALLY GET THE SUPPORTS I NEEDED THE
I DEFINE AUTISM
AND IT JUST GOES TO SHOW YOU HOW WIDE OUR SPECTRUM IS FOR AUTISM IT'S JUST HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE DOING
AUTISM DOESN'T DEFINE MY LIFE
EARLY INTERVENTION IS THE KEY FOR THESE KIDS
I DIDN'T HAVE MANY ASPIRATIONS AS A KID BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF SERVICES I HAD TO
AND ONE OF MY EARLIEST DREAMS WAS TO GET TO COLLEGE
SO WHEN I GOT TO COLLEGE I BECAME AN ADVOCATE
BUT I WAS ONE OF THE LUCKY ONES
I GOT A JOB WORKING IN THE FIELD OF ADVERTISING
THEY TAUGHT ME HOW TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT HIV AND AIDS THEY TAUGHT ME HOW TO ADVOCATE FOR
I MEAN I DO REMEMBER THAT MY HOME STATE OF WISCONSIN BECAME THE FIRST STATE IN THE NATION TO OFFER
IN MY LIFETIME
WHY SHOULD WE IGNORE THOSE ONES OR TREAT THOSE IDENTITIES WORSE
I MEAN IS THAT GOING TO HAPPEN
SO THAT NIGHT WE GOT TOGETHER AND WALKED INTO THAT BAR
ONCE I SAID THOSE WORDS TO MYSELF QUITE FRANKLY THERE WAS NO SHUTTING ME UP
HE SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER BASICALLY MAKING IT ILLEGAL TO WORK FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IF YOU WERE A HOMOSEXUAL
I TOOK THEM TO EVERYONE EVERYWHERE I POSSIBLY COULD
AND THEN YOU LOOK AT CITIES THAT EVOLVED AFTER THE AUTOMOBILE AND IT'S NOT THAT KIND OF A PATTERN
THESE ARE SOME OF THE VEHICLES THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON
WE THINK OF IT AS A COMPACT URBAN CELL
BUT IN THE END THE MAIN THING WE NEED TO FOCUS ON ARE PEOPLE
THEY'RE QUITE FUN
SO WE SAID LET'S START WITH THAT NEIGHBORHOOD CELL
WE THINK WE CAN ALSO PERSONALIZE SUNLIGHT
ACTUALLY WE COULD DO THIS TODAY
CONNECTED TO MASS TRANSIT
THAT'S SORT OF THE ULTIMATE PERSONALIZATION IN SOME WAYS
CITIES ARE ALL ABOUT PEOPLE
I MEAN ARCHITECTS HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THESE IDEAS FOR A LONG TIME
AND THEN WE CAN FORM IN EFFECT A MESH NETWORK
GO UP TO 50000 IF IT'S MANHATTAN DENSITY
WE'RE NOT DOING A VERY GOOD JOB WITH THAT
SO WE WENT BACK AND STARTED LOOKING AT THE GREAT CITIES THAT EVOLVED BEFORE THE CARS
I THOUGHT I WOULD START WITH A VERY BRIEF HISTORY OF CITIES
YOU HAD AUTO NETWORKS
AS DANIELLE SAID MORE THAN HALF THE PEOPLE NOW IN THE WORLD LIVE IN CITIES AND THAT WILL JUST CONTINUE TO
WE HAVE TO GET THIS RIGHT
IT'S NOT ABOUT MAKING WORK FUNNY BUT MAKING WORK FUN
BUT 81 OF EMPLOYEES SAY THAT A FUN WORKPLACE WOULD MAKE THEM MORE PRODUCTIVE AND 98 OF CEOS PREFER
YOU CHOOSE IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO THE THINGS THAT WILL GET YOU PAID MORE
HUMOR IS DEFINED AS COMIC ABSURD OR INCONGRUOUS QUALITY CAUSING AMUSEMENT
I'VE BEEN SKINNY MY ENTIRE LIFE I WAS BORN 8
I WAS A PROJECT MANAGER I GOT TO NAME MY PROJECTS WHATEVER I WANTED
SO INSTEAD OF THE STANDARD RETAIL SALES 2
I DIDN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT BUT SHE WAS STUNNING AND I'D NEVER MET A MODEL LIKE THIS BEFORE
AND I SAID OKAY WELL THEN WHAT DO WE DO HERE
WHERE IS HE
WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO WORK ALMOST ANYWHERE AT ANY TIME
IT PROMOTES ENGAGEMENT AND COLLABORATION
IT MAKES YOU MORE PRODUCTIVE AND TASK FOCUSED
BUT IT DOESN'T STOP THERE
AND WE DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S GOING TO POP UP
AND THEY ALL SEEMED TO BE OK
AND NOW THE BOYS AND THE GIRLS GET THEM
BUT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE LIKE LIZZIE BORDEN LIKE THREE TIMES A CENTURY AND WE'RE KIND OF DUE
BUT THERE'S GONNA BE BAD NEWS SOMEWHERE
AND NOW THEY ARE CLOSE AS CAN BE
NOW THE ONLY PERSON IT TURNS OUT ONE SON AND ONE DAUGHTER SIBLINGS DIDN'T GET ALONG
THEY HAVE THE SAME BRAIN AND THE SAME EEG
SO I THINK AFTER SEVERAL GENERATIONS AND HERE IS THE IDEA WE REALLY HAVE A TINDERBOX
SO THERE IS THE PATTERN THAT EVERY ONE OF THEM HAD BUT THEY ALL WERE A LITTLE DIFFERENT TOO
WELL WHAT THE PROBLEM IS THIS TENDS TO CONCENTRATE THESE GENES
THAT'S WHAT WE'VE EVOLVED TO FEEL
WE'VE LOST A TENNIS BALL'S WORTH OF BRAIN IN THE PAST 30000 YEARS
I MEAN THE POINT AT WHICH WE SWITCHED OVER TO EATING MEAT WE WEREN'T LIKE THE CHIMPANZEE ABLE TO
UNTIL AGRICULTURE IT WAS VERY MUCH ABOUT SURVIVING THE MOMENT AND DOING THE RIGHT THING NOW
SO THEY'RE BRINGING OUT THE BIG GUNS HERE
IT SEEMS LIKE THE NATURAL DIET THAT THEREFORE BRINGS ABOUT THE CONDITIONS OF GOOD HEALTH IN THE BODY
WHY WOULD YOU GO AFTER THIS STUFF WHEN IT'S SO MUCH MORE DIFFICULT
THERE ARE MANY THEORIES ON THAT THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME
BUT ASIDE FROM THAT JUST BEING VEGAN IS SO USEFUL IN TERMS OF SOCIETY BECAUSE
IT'S A GOLF BALL'S WORTH IN THE PAST 20000
WE SEE THE BRAIN TRIPLING IN SIZE
WE SEE THE APPEARANCE OF THE MODERN NEOCORTEX WHICH IS THE EXECUTIVE LAYER OF THE HUMAN BRAIN THAT DEFINES HOW WE PERCEIVE
NO INSTINCT IS THERE FOR NO REASON
SO I THINK WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IT'S NOT THAT THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WRONG IT'S THAT THEY DON'T FEEL A REALLY
I THINK THIS IS THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE
BECAUSE THE PROCESS OF GETTING OLDER IN THE PAST WASN'T ABOUT FORWARD PLANNING
YOU ALL HAVE A CHOICE
COULD YOU HAVE ASKED FOR A BETTER ANSWER TO PRAYER
I KNEW THAT I HAD TO START INVOLVING PATIENTS IN THIS PROCESS OR THEY WOULD NEVER LEARN
THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF ALL THIS IS THE DYNAMIC OF GETTING PEOPLE AROUND A TABLE
INCREASED CONTROL MECHANISMS WON'T SOLVE THAT PROBLEM
THEN IT HIT ME
AT THE END I ENDED UP WITH THE PAPER SENSOR THAT COULD DETECT A 100 OF ALL PANCREATIC OVARIAN AND LUNG
THEY ARE SUPER SUPER COOL
I GOT THE LAB SPACE I NEEDED
THAT'S NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE
ITS NAME WAS MESOTHELIN
AND IT HAS THESE AMAZING PROPERTIES
THE FARM TO TABLE MOVEMENT
IT'S THE WINE INDUSTRY
IN MY THIRD LESSON I NEEDED TO FIGURE OUT IF WINE FLOUR COULD BE IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO
WHILE AT FIRST THE NUMBERS WERE OVERWHELMING THE FINGER LAKES WINE INDUSTRY PRODUCES OVER 11000
BUT LIKE ALL QUESTIONS AND LESSONS THERE ARE NUMEROUS LAYERS THAT NEED TO BE PEELED IN ORDER FOR THE
THESE IDEAS REMINDED ME OF THREE CHALLENGING INSTANCES IN MY LIFE THAT I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU
IT'S A STORY ABOUT COURAGE ABOUT A MAN NAME BENAIAH WHO CHASED A LION DOWN INTO A PIT
IN MANY A PIECE OF MUSIC IT'S THE PAUSE OR THE REST THAT GIVES THE PIECE ITS BEAUTY AND ITS
SOME PEOPLE GO TO BLACK HOLE RESORTS WHERE THEY'LL SPEND HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS A NIGHT IN ORDER TO HAND OVER THEIR
OTHERWISE REALLY I'M JUST FOISTING ON THEM MY EXHAUSTION OR MY DISTRACTEDNESS WHICH IS NO
I HAVE NEVER ONCE HAD TO USE A CELL PHONE THERE
I HAD REALLY INTERESTING FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES I HAD A NICE APARTMENT ON PARK AVENUE AND 20TH
IT'S AN OLD IDEA
WHEREVER WE ARE ANY TIME OF NIGHT OR DAY OUR BOSSES JUNK MAILERS OUR PARENTS CAN GET TO
AND KEVIN WROTE HIS LAST BOOK ON FRESH TECHNOLOGIES WITHOUT A SMARTPHONE OR A LAPTOP OR A TV
IT COMES FROM THE BRAIN NOT FROM THE WORKS OF ART
IF YOU DON'T ADHD YOURSELF CHANCES ARE YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WHO DOES
I'M HAPPIER AND MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN I'VE EVER BEEN IN MY LIFE
THEY'RE YOUR EMPLOYEE YOUR BOSS YOUR FRIEND THEY'RE IN THIS ROOM
WE LEARN HOW OUR BRAINS AND BODIES WORK BY WATCHING THOSE AROUND US
IT WASN'T UNTIL MIDDLE SCHOOL WHEN I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR GETTING MYSELF TO CLASSES ON TIME AND REMEMBERING TO BRING MY OWN
I STARTED HAVING TROUBLE MAKING IT TO CLASS ON TIME
I THOUGHT IT WAS MOSTLY ABOUT GETTING DISTRACTED
WE DO THIS KIND OF THING ALL THE TIME TO PROTECT COPYRIGHT
THEY CALLED HER A SLUT AND A WHORE AND THEY MADE HER LIFE MISERABLE
SO IN THE 1920S WE GOT SHATTER RESISTANT WINDSHIELDS IN THE 1950S SEAT BELTS
IF YOU BUY AN E BOOK YOU CAN'T JUST SEND IT OUT TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS YOU WANT SO WHY NOT TRY
THIS IDEA OF AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT COMES FROM ANTI RAPE ACTIVISTS WHO TELL US THAT WE
PARENTS AND EDUCATORS ARE ALSO RESPONDING TO SEXTING WITHOUT REALLY THINKING TOO MUCH ABOUT
IT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE WORRYING ABOUT NOW WITH SOCIAL MEDIA AND DRONE CAMERAS AND OF COURSE
WE COULD DESIGN THE CAR TO MAKE IT SAFER
WE GO INTO THE ARCTIC WE FIND THE REALLY WELL PRESERVED MAMMOTH BONE WE TAKE A CHUNK OUT OF IT AND BRING IT BACK TO THE LAB AND WE SEQUENCE
WE WILL LEARN HOW TO FIX THE BROKEN BITS SO WE CAN START PIECING TOGETHER THESE LITTLE TINY FRAGMENTS INTO LONGER AND LONGER
AND TO SOME EXTENT THAT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE BUT THERE IS ANOTHER PROBLEM
GIVE YOU A HINT IS NOT A VERY BIG NUMBER
NOT SO FOR THE MAMMOTH
BUT AS WE PROGRESS TOWARD THIS GOAL WE'RE GOING TO LEARN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT ABOUT THESE EXTINCT ANIMALS KNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE
A ROPE OR A RIBBON OR PARTY STREAMERS SAY LIKE THOSE WE'RE GONNA PUT UP TO CELEBRATE THE BIRTH OF
IF IT'S WHAT WE WANT TO DO WE WILL EVENTUALLY BE ABLE TO SEQUENCE THE COMPLETE GENOME OF AN EXTINCT ANIMAL
I COULD GET DNA FROM FOSSILS AND USE THIS TO WATCH SPECIES EVOLVE THROUGH TIME
IT'S THE OTHER PART THE HETEROCHROMATIN THAT IS MADE OF TIGHTLY CONDENSED REPEAT SEQUENCES THAT ARE JUST SUPER HARD TO
AND IT'S BEEN COLD CONSISTENTLY FOR AT LEAST THE LAST MILLION YEARS
WE LOOK FOR FROZEN BONES WHEREVER THE PERMAFROST IS MELTING ALONG RIVERBEDS AROUND LAKES AND AT ACTIVE GOLD MINING SITES
WHEN ALL WAS PUT TOGETHER AND MAPPED TO THE ELEPHANT IT LOOKED LIKE ABOUT 50 OF THE MAMMOTH GENOME HAD BEEN
FOR MUCH OF MY LIFE I NEVER WONDERED ABOUT MY CHOICE TO EAT CERTAIN ANIMALS BECAUSE I NEVER EVEN KNEW I HAD A CHOICE
HINTS OF THE TRUTH SURROUND US
EATING ANIMALS WAS JUST A GIVEN
AND SHE REPLIES THE SECRET IS IN THE MEAT
NO ONE HAD EVER ASKED ME IF I BELIEVED IN EATING ANIMALS
I KNOW IT CAN BE PAINFUL TO SEE THAT
SO I WANT TO REMIND YOU THAT MY INTENTION IS SIMPLY TO RAISE AWARENESS
AND ALTHOUGH THE EXPERIENCE OF EACH SET OF VICTIMS WILL ALWAYS BE SOMEWHAT UNIQUE THE
AND THEN SOMETHING INTERESTING HAPPENED
IN A MOMENT I'M GOING TO SHOW A TWO MINUTE VIDEO OF ANIMAL FACTORIES WHICH CAN BE DIFFICULT
CHANCES ARE YOUR EXPERIENCE OF THE MEAT DRAMATICALLY CHANGED
I IDENTIFIED AND CODIFIED THIS FACTOR AND I'M HERE TO SHARE MY FINDINGS WITH YOU
SO I CARED ABOUT FRITZ AND I'M NOT UNIQUE
MOST OF US CARE ABOUT ANIMALS
I JUST WANTED TO REMIND YOU ALL THAT YOU STILL HAVE THE HELMETS ON WHICH IS GREAT
AND THE RIVER RUNS ABOUT 520KMS FROM TORNETR SK DOWN TO BOTTENVIKEN
AND I WANTED THAT STORY TO START IN LAKE OKEECHOBEE THE BEATING HEART OF THE EVERGLADE SYSTEM
IN THE EVERGLADES THEY ARE THE VERY ARCHITECTS OF THE EVERGLADES BECAUSE AS THE WATER DROPS DOWN IN THE
IT IS RESILIENT
AND THE GOAL THEN IS TO USE THAT EXPERT BRAIN MAP AS A
THE FIRST MEDIUM I FELT GAVE ME A VOICE WAS MUSIC
THAT'S BAD ENOUGH
THAT'S ALL THE FRESH WATER ON THE EARTH
AND THAT PERSON HAS TO HAVE AN ARMY
AVERAGE DEPTH IS ABOUT TWO MILES
THE FLOOR OF THE OCEAN
THIS PLEASURE PRINCIPLE AT THE HEART OF THE CREATIVE ENERGY IS METAPHORICALLY KNOWN AS OSUN
SO NOW OSUN HONEY AND OSUNALITY RE AFFIRM THE NORMALITY OF SEXUAL PLEASURE AND THE
HE CAME UP WITH A NAME FOR HIS MYSTERY AGENT
THAT PERHAPS WILL ALLOW US TO IDENTIFY THE CAUSE OF A CANCER THAT AFFLICTS US OR IDENTIFY THE SOURCE OF AN
AND WHEN PEOPLE CHANGE THEN SOCIETY HAS TO AS WELL
IT GOT TO THE POINT WHERE AT THIS JUNCTION THAT I WAS SITTING AT I DIDN'T KNOW WHICH PATHWAY TO GO
AND THEN I WOULD BE HARANGUED
WHAT WE REALIZE ABOUT THOSE WOMEN IS THAT WHEN THEY ARE ABLE TO BREAK INTO THAT WORLD THEY MAKE AN IMPACT
I CAN TELL YOU THIS
BUT IF YOU ASK ME THE QUESTION TODAY WHO ARE YOU AMMA
WHERE ARE YOU FROM
THE QUESTION OF WHO DEFINES YOU
THINK OF HOW MANY INSTITUTIONS I CAN THINK OF THEM RIGHT NOW
WE HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR X AND X AMOUNT OF YEARS SO WE CAN'T CHANGE IT NOW IT'S
BUT THERE IS ANOTHER WAY THERE IS MANY OTHER WAYS
NOW THIS FUNNY THING HAPPENED
NOT MUCH TO THE PLOT
THERE IS A LOT OF VALUE TO BE GAINED BY BECOMING A STORYTELLER AND REALIZING THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE
WITH THE SAME PLOT WITH THE SAME EVENTS I CAN TELL ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT STORIES
IT TOOK MONTHS AND MONTHS AND HUNDREDS OF E MAILS AND HUNDREDS OF PHONE CONVERSATIONS AND ALL THIS RUNNING AROUND
A FEW YEARS I MIGHT DO PHYSICS THEN I MIGHT DO ECONOMICS I MIGHT DO THEATER I MIGHT DO DANCE
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO HIM HE FOUND THE BEST POSSIBLE STORY TO TELL ABOUT THAT THE MOST USEFUL STORY TO HIM
WE LIKE FEELING STRONG
SLOWING DOWN THE BODY CAN HELP SLOW DOWN THE MIND
BUT WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT YOU OR SOMEONE WHO REALLY STRUGGLES WITH ANGER CAN GET VERY USED TO THE SIGHT OF
AND AFTER A WHILE ALL THOSE TERRIFYING EMOTIONS JUST STOPPED BEING SO TERRIFYING AND START BEING NORMAL HUMAN
DON'T GET ME WRONG I HAVE NO ASPIRATIONS TO BE THE LEADER OF A WORLDWIDE RELIGION
THAT REALLY CAME TO HEAD FOR ME WHEN MY SON WAS ABOUT 3 MONTH OLD AND I WAS HOME TAKING
PARENTS AMONG YOU WILL NOT BE SURPRISED TO FIND OUT THAT ON THIS PARTICULAR DAY MY SON TOOK ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF LONGER
IT PUSHES PEOPLE AWAY
WE ARE TRYING TO CHANGE WHAT WE CAN WITH GENTLE PUSHING AND PULLING BUT WE'RE NOT WILLING TO PUSH IT TO THE POINT WHERE WE'RE
I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT THE MITROVICA ROCK SCHOOL IN KOSOVO
AND IT TAKES TIME BUT WE HAVE HAD SOME SMALL SUCCESS STORIES WITH THESE PEOPLE TOO
BUT THEY WERE FORBIDDEN BY AUTHORITIES AT THE TIME TO PROMOTE THE SINGLE WITH A GIG
BUT THE FACT IS THAT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE WAR BANDS STARTED TO
WHEN MUSICIANS WITHOUT BORDERS FIRST ARRIVED IN MITROVICA WE WERE ASKED TO HELP REVIVE THE CITY'S ROCK
THAT'S BEEN DONE
BUT WOULD IT MAKE IT EASIER FOR YOU TO KNOW WHAT'S TRUE
THE SECOND THING CAN BE SUMMED UP BY THE LATIN PHRASE THAT KANT TOOK AS THE MOTTO FOR
I THINK IT'S A HUMAN PROBLEM HAVING TO DO WITH HOW WE THINK AND WHAT WE VALUE
WE AGREE THAT YOU CAN'T FLAP YOUR ARMS AND FLY
PROTAGORAS SAID THAT OBJECTIVE TRUTH WAS AN ILLUSION BECAUSE MAN IS THE MEASURE OF ALL THINGS
WE ALREADY CARRY A WORLD OF INFORMATION AROUND IN OUR POCKETS BUT IT SEEMS AS IF THE MORE INFORMATION WE
OUR ONLINE LIFE IS PERSONALIZED EVERYTHING FROM THE ADS WE READ TO THE NEWS THAT COMES DOWN OUR FACEBOOK
I DON'T THINK THAT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY IT IS A TECHNOLOGICAL PROBLEM
HOW WAS HER PERCEPTION OF THE WORLD DIFFERENT FROM MINE
THIS COULD BE PHARMACOLOGY BASED AND COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY BASED
IN OTHER WORDS WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO HAVE A GOOD THEORY OF MIND TO BE ABLE TO PUT ONESELF
CHOOSE OPTION A NOT B
THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE HIGH VALUES OF KAPPA
THIS MEANS THE LOSS OF BEACHES AND THE LOSS OF LANDS AND THIS LAND BEING LOST IS LOST IN PIRAMBU
I SAID MAJOR MCDOW I NEED YOUR HELP
I MEAN A REALLY SMALL TRAILER PARK
THE SECOND THING I DO IS THIS
THE PIECE THAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THAT IS THAT WE HAD SIMILAR KINDS OF EXPERIENCES FROM IDAHO
AND BESIDES WE HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY AND WE REALLY DON'T WANT TO DAMAGE THAT
30 7 O'CLOCK WE GOT A LITTLE BIT TIRED AND WE SAID WHY DON'T WE GET A MOTEL SO THAT WE CAN REST AND THEN HAVE AN EARLY
AFTER IT'S OVER CALL US AND WE'LL BE THE ONES TO CHALLENGE
SO AS A RESULT OF THAT AND FEELING REJECTED I WENT BACK TO THE BASE AND I TALKED TO THE SQUADRON
WHEN STOPPED BY THE POLICE WE PLACE BOTH HANDS ON THE STEERING WHEEL AT THE 12 O'CLOCK POSITION
BUT YOU KNOW THE PROBLEM
AND WE MOVED INTO IT AND WE BECAME HOMEOWNERS IN MOUNTAIN HOME IDAHO
I WENT TO ONE AFTER ANOTHER AFTER ANOTHER
SO WHAT I DID AND HE SAID YOU SHOULDN'T WORRY JIM BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF TRAILER PARKS SO I PUT
SOMEWHERE AROUND 6
I SAID I WOULD LIKE TO GET A MOTEL FOR THE EVENING FOR MY FAMILY
WE DO EVERYTHING THAT YOU TOLD US TO DO
AND SO AS A GRANDPARENT WHAT DO I TELL MY GRANDSONS
HOW DO I KEEP THEM SAFE HOW DO I KEEP THEM ALIVE
SO I CALLED MY WIFE AND I SAID WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THIS THING WORK
BUT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I FIGURED THAT WAS THE BEST THING THAT I COULD DO
HE SAID BEFORE I SAY YES TO THAT I NEED TO CHECK WITH MANAGEMENT
WE HAVE TO CHALLENGE THAT IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE
WHAT CAN WE DO
YOU NEED TO PUSH BACK YOU NEED TO CHALLENGE
HIS NAME WAS MCDOW MAJOR MCDOW
UPON FIRST ARRIVING THERE THE FIRST GOAL THAT I HAD WAS FOR ME TO IDENTIFY
I WAS JUST COMING DOWN TO MAKE MY SELECTION
WE WERE REJECTED FROM HOTELS MOTELS AND RESTAURANTS
NOR DID I GET ANY RESPONSES FROM THE OTHER PEOPLE THAT THEY GAVE ME ON THE LIST WHERE I COULD GET APARTMENTS
AND HERE'S WHAT THE BOYS HAVE BEEN TAUGHT TO TELL THEM WE KNOW THAT YOU CAN DO THAT BUT PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT
AND SO WE HAD A GREAT SLEEP THAT NIGHT
LET LIFE HAPPEN
BLACK AND WHITE THINKING
I WAS AT UNIVERSITY AND ANXIETY WAS BEGINNING TO TAKE A STRONG HOLD
I'D SUBMIT TO IMPERFECTION AND I WOULD FACE FAILURE
I WAS LUCKY TO FIND MANY GIRLS IN DIFFERENT SCHOOLS THAT CONTINUE HELPING ME MANAGE THE PROJECT AND I
THE PHENOMENA STARTED AGAIN
THAT IS TRUE
MEN WERE SEEING SOMETHING DIFFERENT WERE SEEING A PINK CAR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RACING TRACK
I WAS REALLY NERVOUS OBVIOUSLY
LET'S MAKE OUR UNIFORMS PINK
WE CAN STRIP THAT TISSUE VERY ECONOMICALLY AND SO THIS IS HOW WE CAN GET BIOLOGIC KNEE REPLACEMENT TO
SO THERE MUST BE SOME EVOLUTIONARY ADVANTAGE OF HAVING DYSLEXIA
UNTIL MORE RESEARCH IS DONE WE DON'T HAVE AN EXACT ANSWER
IN OUR STUDY WE LOOKED AT
AND WHILE THERE IS LARGE INDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY WE SEE THIS STRONG CORRELATION BETWEEN READING
IN OTHER WORDS THE POORER THE PERFORMANCE IN READING OR MORE DYSLEXIC YOU WERE THE HIGHER PERFORMANCE IN
ANOTHER SMALL YET A VERY BIG THING HAPPENED TO ME WHEN MY SON LUCAS WAS BORN
IT'S JUST A GREAT TIME OF EXERCISE AND FUN AND BONDING
I'M A BUSINESS PROFESSOR HERE AT UTAH STATE AND I TEACH THE NEGOTIATIONS CLASS
SO HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE WOKEN UP ON A MONDAY MORNING AND REALIZED YOU HAD TO GO TO WORK AND YOU'RE LIKE OH PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME GO
WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY THIRD TACTIC
SO WHY ARE WE DOING IT
YOUR MONEY CAN BE STOLEN
I WASN'T WEIGHED DOWN BY EXPERTISE OR CONVENTIONAL WISDOM
AND TURN IT INTO A RHYTHM AND PLACE IT WITH THE LIPS I READ
IN SOME OF THESE BRAINS SCIENTISTS DISCOVERED SOMETHING SURPRISING
A SINGLE NIGHT OF SLEEP DEPRIVATION LEADS TO AN INCREASE IN AMYLOID BETA
WE GAIN AND LOSE SYNAPSES ALL THE TIME THROUGH A PROCESS CALLED NEURAL PLASTICITY
SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN AMYLOID PLAQUES ACCUMULATE TO THIS TIPPING POINT
NOW EVERYONE LOOK AT TWO PEOPLE
SO FAR WE HAVEN'T CHANGED OUR BRAIN'S DESTINY
WELL THE FIRST ONE WAS IS YOUR NAME HASAN
AND EVERYTHING'S AUTOMATED AT THE OTHER END
WHO PAYS FOR YOUR TRIPS
IS TODAY TUESDAY
I'M WATCHING WHO'S WATCHING ME
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS
BECAUSE NO ONE'S REALLY WATCHING
I'M GOING TO PASS THIS ONTO THE TAMPA OFFICE
SO EVER SINCE THEN BEFORE I WOULD GO ANYWHERE I WOULD CALL THE FBI
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WASTE YOUR ENERGY OR YOUR RESOURCES
WHY WERE YOU THERE
SO I'M GOING TO FINISH WITH A STORY
DAY FIVE OF ANTIBIOTICS SHE DEVELOPS DIARRHEA A KNOWN SIDE EFFECT OF ANY ANTIBIOTIC
I LOOKED AND SAID COULD WE TRY A DIFFERENT APPROACH
IT WAS PRESCRIBED JUST IN CASE
SHE DOES FINE POST OP
I'M NOT REALLY SURE THIS IMPACTS ME
IT'S JUST RAW MATERIAL
WE SHOW IT GERTRUDE STEIN WHAT WE GET BACK IS GERTRUDE STEIN
SO MY FIRST INSIGHT IS THAT FOR SOME REASON WE ASSOCIATE POETRY WITH BEING
BUT WHAT WE'VE SEEN JUST NOW IS THAT THE HUMAN IS NOT A SCIENTIFIC FACT THAT IT'S AN EVER SHIFTING
SO THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN THIS TEST ONLINE SO WE HAVE RESULTS
SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TRY A DIFFERENT APPROACH
CAN WE BUILD A CREATIVE COMPUTER
WE SHOW IT WILLIAM BLAKE THAT'S WHAT IT REFLECTS BACK TO US
SO MY FINAL INSIGHT IS THAT THE COMPUTER MORE OR LESS WORKS LIKE A MIRROR THAT
WHAT WE SEEM TO BE ASKING OVER AND OVER IS CAN WE BUILD A HUMAN LIKE COMPUTER
BUT WE SHOULD ALSO BE ASKING OURSELVES WHAT IDEA OF THE HUMAN DO WE WANT TO HAVE REFLECTED BACK TO US
MORE THAN ANY OTHER BIT OF TECHNOLOGY THE COMPUTER IS A MIRROR THAT REFLECTS ANY IDEA OF THE
WE'RE ALSO ASKING WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE HUMAN AND HOW DO WE PUT BOUNDARIES AROUND
HOW DO WE SAY WHO OR WHAT CAN BE PART OF THIS CATEGORY
IT SIMPLY MEANS THAT THE CATEGORY OF THE HUMAN IS UNSTABLE
WELL YES ABSOLUTELY IT CAN
IT WAS MUCH HARDER
SO IN 2013 MY FRIEND BENJAMIN LAIRD AND I WE CREATED A TURING TEST FOR POETRY ONLINE
WHAT IS A COMPUTER
I ALSO BELIEVE THAT ALAN TURING UNDERSTOOD THIS AND THAT WHEN HE DEVISED HIS TEST BACK IN 1950
THEY HAVE HELPED ME OVER THE YEARS TO COME OUT OF THE DARKNESS
THOSE CRIMES SHOULD NOT GO UNPUNISHED
I'VE LOST THAT COUNT
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO LOSE THE PROTECTION OF MY COUNTRY
I CANNOT FORGET THEM
HE WOULD SCREAM
AND NOT JUST ANY TYPE OF BRAIN CANCER HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH ONE OF THE MOST DEADLY FORMS OF BRAIN CANCER
I DON'T THINK WE QUITE WON THIS WAR YET AND I DON'T THINK ANYONE HERE WILL QUESTION THAT
I TOOK OUT EVERYTHING
SO THE BEST THING THAT HAPPENED TO US SO FAR IN THE MEDICAL ARENA IN CANCER RESEARCH IS THE FACT THAT THE
A LOT OF THINGS ARE GOING THROUGH YOUR HEAD
FOR ME IT WAS MOSTLY OUTRAGE
SUSTAINABILITY IS NOT ABOUT SEEING THE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES THAT ARE FACING OUR SOCIETY TODAY
THE ANSWERS ARE IN ALL OF OUR BACKYARDS
AND THEY WALKED AWAY FROM THESE IMPACTS UNSCATHED BECAUSE THEIR SPINES HAVE EVOLVED IMPRESSIVE SHOCK ABSORBING
AND SO IT'S KIND OF NO WONDER GOJO IS AN EARLY ADOPTER OF BIOMIMICRY SINCE AFTER ALL
ONE OF THE FIRST TASKS THAT I WAS ASSIGNED WHEN I STARTED AT GOJO WAS TO LEAD A BIOMIMICRY
BUT WE ALSO SAW A DANGEROUS TREND VIOLENT EXTREMISTS KNOW THE RULES AND REGULATIONS OF SOCIAL
THEY TALKED VERY LITTLE ABOUT POLITICS
ALL OF A SUDDEN WE WERE IN THEIR KITCHENS
SO ALL OF A SUDDEN WE COULDN'T TRACK WHERE THAT CONVERSATION WENT
HOW DO WE PROVIDE ALTERNATIVES FOR THAT
I'VE BEEN THERE
IF YOU WANT TO TALK I'M HERE
WE HAD FOREIGN TERRORIST FIGHTERS TWEETING IN THEIR OWN LANGUAGES
THEY MUST HAVE SOMETHING WRONG WITH THEIR UPBRINGING
SO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE PULL FACTORS
AND YOU BECOME WHAT IS GOOD CHALLENGING WHAT IS EVIL
NOWADAYS SHE HAS A DOG AND TWO CATS WHICH SHE LOVES A LOT
WHAT WE EAT ESPECIALLY ANIMAL PRODUCTS HAS A BIG IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT
AS CHILDREN WE WERE TAUGHT NOT TO HARM ANIMALS BUT THAT WE HAVE TO
PEOPLE OFTEN ASK ME WHY I'M A VEGAN WHY I BECAME VEGAN
IT'S JUST THE WAY THINGS ARE
WE USED TO PLAY WHEN WE WERE KIDS
WHEN WE ARRIVED AT OUR FINAL DESTINATION
WE HAD HOMEMADE POTATO SALAD WHITE BUNS BOILED EGGS AND SAUSAGES
FOR WOMEN THEY USED THE STORY OF EMANCIPATION AND SEXINESS
AS A JOURNALIST YOUR READERS
IT'S AN APOCALYPTIC FUTURE
YOU MUST IMAGINE A HABIT LIKE AN ICEBERG
WHAT IS THAT STORY ABOUT
THIS STORY IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO BREAK THE POWER OF THE IMMEDIATE HAPPINESS THAT I CAN GET
SO THESE STORIES ARE NOT CREDIBLE
IT'S A STORY ABOUT THE COLLAPSE OF THE PLANET
WE DON'T BELIEVE THEM
WHAT YOU CANNOT SEE UNDER THE WATER ARE THE VALUES AND BELIEFS THAT DRIVE
WE ARE VERY GOOD IN SHIFTING THE BLAME SOMEWHERE ELSE AND RATIONALISING OUR OWN UNSUSTAINABLE
SO WE FRAME IT AS A PROBLEM OF PRODUCTION
WHAT IS IT THAT EXPLAINS THIS GAP BETWEEN INTENTIONS AND BEHAVIOR
BUT LET'S COME BACK TO IT
BY THE WAY TONY HAYWARD THE FORMER CEO OF BP HAD A PLAQUE ON HIS DESK INSCRIBED WITH THIS
AS JARED DIAMOND AND OTHERS HAVE SHOWN US THIS IS HOW CIVILIZATIONS COMMIT SUICIDE
WE ARE FINALIZING THE PRE CLINICAL TESTING AND THE ANIMAL MODEL REQUIRED PRIOR TO ASKING
SO HOW CAN WE MAKE PANCREATIC CANCER TREATMENT MORE EFFECTIVE
THEY WILL REACH HEALTHY ORGANS RESULTING IN HIGH TOXIC EFFECT FOR THE PATIENTS
WE ARE WORKING RELENTLESSLY TO BRING THIS TECHNOLOGY TO THE NEXT LEVEL
WE'VE SPENT THE LAST 40 YEARS TRYING TO IMPROVE CARE AT THE END OF LIFE AND BY SOME MEASURES
HOPE IS VITAL
THE CLOSER WE GET THE END OF OUR LIVES THE MORE FEARFUL WE BECOME THE MORE
LET'S TALK ABOUT A PATIENT NAMED LISA
DON'T TAKE MY HOPE AWAY IS WHAT THEY BEG OF US NEAR THE END
ONE OF MY PATIENTS WAS TELLING ME HOW UPSET SHE WAS WITH HER ONCOLOGIST
DEATH IS NOT A FAILURE OF WILL
HE COULD NEVER ACCEPT THAT
DEATH IS NOT A BATTLE WE HAVE LOST
WHY IS THAT
BUT AS I SAID THIS HASN'T WORKED OUT VERY WELL
THAT'S BECAUSE WE DO WANT A PEACEFUL COMFORTABLE AND DIGNIFIED DEATH BUT
LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE
AMERICA'S YOUNG WOMEN ARE RUNNING OUT OF OXYGEN
SO I WASN'T BUYING IT
I'M A PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGEON AND FOR THE LAST 30 YEARS I'VE SPENT MY WHOLE
AND WE TRY TO SEAL THAT SURFACE SO ONCE WE GOT THAT SURFACE SEALED WE'RE SAFE
PEOPLE DIE WAITING
WE'VE GOT THE CELLS IN THE PLACE
WHERE COULD WE GET THE SKIN FROM
THEY'VE GOT TO LOOK AND SEE WHERE ELSE THEY CAN FIND INFORMATION
I WOULD GET TO THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN 20 YEARS MORE NO TROUBLE WE PLANT THE FLAG AT THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN BUT MY
SOMEWHAT LESS THAN SUBTLE
AND WE'RE CHASING THAT ILLUSIVE GOAL FOR MORE COMPLEX SITUATIONS
AND SO TRADITIONALLY WHEN I STARTED OVER 30 YEARS AGO WE WOULD TAKE THE SURFACE OF THE SKIN JUST
THAT TOMORROW EVERY MORNING WHEN YOU GET UP IT'S THE START OF A NEW JOURNEY
TAKING IT FROM THERE PUTTING IN A SOUP TRYING TO KEEP THE SOUP UNDER THE DRESSINGS
SO HOW DID WE ACHIEVE THAT
AND SO I PUT IT TO YOU
THE SCARS WILL NEVER LEAVE HIM
WELL WE STARTED LOOKING
AND I SAID WE DON'T WALK AWAY BECAUSE WE HAVE NOW THE TECHNOLOGY AND 20 YEARS
HOW COULD WE GET BACK TO THAT WHEN IT'S DAMAGED
BUT IT GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY FOR LIFE IF WE CAN SEAL THAT SURFACE WE ARE SAFE AND WE CAN HAVE THAT
WE HAVE THE PAIN WE STILL HAVE INFECTION AS THE BIGGEST KILLER WE HAVE TO SEAL THE SKIN OVER AS THE
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON
WHEN YOU TREAT SOMEBODY WITH BURNS IT'S A MASSIVE JUGGLING EXERCISE
IF YOU HEAL A BURN WITHIN 10 DAYS YOU GET A 4 RISK OF SCARRING IF YOU HEAL A BURN WITHIN 21 DAYS
FROM THE EMBRYO TO DEATH
SO WHERE TO NOW
I SEE PEOPLE'S LIVES THAT HAVE CHANGED IN AN INSTANT
BY MESHING IT OUT
AND SO WE STARTED DOING EXPERIMENTS AROUND THIS
I'VE SAID ALREADY ONE DAY IN A BURNS UNIT IS A DAY TOO LONG
HE HAD 92 BODY SURFACE AREA BURNS AND I WAS EXPECTED TO WALK AWAY
AT THAT STAGE YOU GAIN A WHOLE RAFT OF MORE EXPERIMENTS TO DO
WHERE DID I START TO THINK THAT WE COULD DO BETTER
THE TIME TAKEN TO MAKE SURE THOSE CELLS WERE ON THE RIGHT WAY UP FIXING EACH PATCH ONTO
THEY GREW IT INTO SHEETS THAT CAME BACK
AND THEN THE HEALING GOES ON AS I'VE DESCRIBED
HOW COULD WE SHORTEN THAT THREE WEEKS
THOSE CELLS UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS WILL KEEP US WHOLE
AND CERTAINLY IN EMBRYOLOGY AND IN BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES IN GENETICS WE CAN SEE ALL SORTS OF THINGS HAPPENING
NOW WE MAY STEP BACK FROM THIS AND THINK WOW WHAT IS IT THAT WE DO
BECAUSE AS WE'VE CHANGED THE GOALPOST PEOPLE SURVIVE MORE AND MORE AND MORE MASSIVE INJURIES
AND SO WE STARTED IN THE SKIN LAB IN 1993 AND OUR FIRST SHEETS WE GREW IN 10 DAYS
AND I RECENTLY HAD COFFEE WITH A PATIENT I MET IN 1991 1ST OF OCTOBER IN 1991
WHEN HE ONLY HAD 8 OF HIS BODY LEFT
WHAT CREATE WHAT SELF ORGANIZING SYSTEMS MAKES ME THIS SHAPE
EACH LITTLE CELL CAN COVER MUCH GREATER AREA THAN WHEN WE COALESCE THEM INTO A SHEET
WE SEE SUFFERINGS WE SEE LIVES CHANGED IN AN INSTANT AND IT CAN HAPPEN TO ANYONE
WHAT SELF ORGANIZES THIS SYSTEMS
IT HIT ME STRAIGHT BETWEEN THE EYES THAT THIS BOY WOULD NEVER MOVE PROPERLY AGAIN HE WOULD
JUST BEAR ONE SECOND A FRACTION OF A SECOND FOR HALF YOUR BODY BEING BURNT
BUT ESSENTIALLY RECOGNIZABLE THROUGH LIFE
BUT 5 DAYS IS A LONG TIME
HOW COULD WE STOP THAT
WHY WAIT 3 WEEKS
SO WE GREW SKIN CELLS INTO SHEETS
AND WE TAKE THAT OUT IT'S LIKE A BREAD AND BUTTER SANDWICH AND WE COULD PEEL THOSE SLICES OF THE SKIN APART
SO HOW WHEN WE GET BIGGER AND BIGGER BURNS WE'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE TECHNOLOGIES ARE ADVANCING WE KNOW THE
I WALKED WITH HIM TO HIS OFFICE
LET'S THROW HIM OUT
WHERE WAS THIS GUILT TRIP COMING FROM
HE WAS 20 SOME YEARS OLDER THAN ANYBODY ELSE IN THE SAMPLE
AND I THINK THE REAL CHALLENGE IS TO FIGURE OUT WHERE ARE THE CASES IN OUR LIVES WHERE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WORK ON US
MAYBE WE DON'T RECOGNIZE IT EVERY TIME BUT WE UNDERSTAND THAT IT HAPPENS
WOULD WE HAVE THROWN HIM OUT THEN
AND I'M SURE THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ALL RECOGNIZE AND WE SEE THAT IT HAPPENS
SO WE HAD ONE GROUP THAT I HOPED THEIR PERFORMANCE WOULD BE VERY HIGH ANOTHER GROUP THAT I THOUGHT THEIR PERFORMANCE WOULD BE VERY LOW AND
WE HAVE LASERS WE CAN WHITEN IT OUT
THIS IS COMING FROM A JEWISH GUY ALL RIGHT SO THAT MEANS A LOT
AND I WENT TO HIS DEPUTY AND ASKED HIM WHAT WAS GOING ON
WHATEVER YOU ATTEND TO YOU FORM SOME REPRESENTATION NOT NECESSARILY COMPLETELY ACCURATE BUT SOME
YOU'VE GOT TOO MUCH INFORMATION IN THERE
AND WHEN I GOT TO OXFORD CIRCUS ON THE METRO I GOT OFF THE TRAIN TO GO TO MY
WHY A TEAM FRAMEWORK
AND ONCE THE ANALOGY LANDED HE RAN OFF IT WE TALKED ABOUT THE TEAMS THAT WE GREW UP ON AS KIDS I SAID I GREW UP ON A
THE FIRST IS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE COMPANY IS TRYING TO DO
D ANALOGIES WORK REALLY WELL FOR ME AND WORKS WELL FOR HIM
THIS IS A WORD I LOVE YOU AND I PROBABLY KNOW WHAT IS STANDOUT DIFFERENT BUT THERE'S ANOTHER DEFINITION ACTUALLY COMES
WHEN DOING BRAND
AND THEY'LL CHOOSE TO EVOLVE THEIR PROMISE WHEN THEY WANT TO STAND FOR SOMETHING NEW OR THE MARKET IS NO LONGER RESPONDING TO THEIR
AND THERE ARE THREE PARTS TO A BRAND EVOLUTION PROCESS
IT'S ESSENTIALLY THIS VIRTUAL MAP THAT ONLY EXISTS IN YOUR BRAIN
MAYBE YOU'VE HAD THAT EXPERIENCE AS WELL
SO THAT'S WHAT I DID
WHAT WE DO IS WE SET UP AN EXPERIMENT FOR STUDENTS TO THINK ABOUT
WE'VE SEEN THE NUMBER OF THE SCIENCE FAIR PROJECTS INCREASE IN TERMS OF THEIR APPLICATION TO SPORTS
PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL FIELD
SO OUR GOAL IS TO MAKE THE MATH AND THE SCIENCE SO SIMPLE
LET'S SET UP AN EXPERIMENT
WE WANT TO EMPOWER THESE TEACHERS TO REALLY BE THE DEPLOYMENT MECHANISM FOR THE PROGRAM
AND WE ARE GROWING THIS PROGRAM WORLDWIDE
WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH OUR SCIENCE IN BASEBALL PROGRAM IN ARIZONA CALIFORNIA ILLINOIS AND
AND I LIVED IN BOSTON ACTUALLY DURING THE TIME WHEN THE CURSE OF THE BAMBINO WAS BROKEN
SO SO FAR WE TRAINED 200 TEACHERS IN ARIZONA
SO THINK ABOUT THAT
BUT IT TURNS OUT THE PYTHAGOREAN THEOREM IS A VERY POWERFUL TOOL IN BASEBALL
SO GOOD JOB
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THIS LABEL IS IT IS A LIFE LONG THING
WHAT IS NATURAL RECOVERY
BUT IT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED
I DIDN'T KNOW IF I WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL CASE OR NOT I REALLY DIDN'T CARE ALL I KNOW IS THAT I HAD REALLY BIG DREAMS
I WASN'T READY TO CARRY THE BURDEN OF A LIFE LONG DRUG ADDICT LABEL
IT'S SOMETHING THAT I CANNOT FIX AND I ONLY HAVE TWO CHOICES
THAT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE
BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY ABUSE IS JUST ABOUT POWER AND CONTROL
BECAUSE GUESS WHAT
NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO YOU DO NOT DESERVE TO BE TREATED WITH DISRESPECT AND
IT'S BETTER IF YOU JUST BRUSH IT UNDER THE RUG KEEP IT BEHIND CLOSED DOORS BURY YOUR HEAD IN THE SAND AND
IT CREEPS UP ON YOU
I HAD A PURPOSE
WE'RE MEANT TO BE IMPERFECT
BUT THERE'S A VERY FINE LINE BETWEEN HEALTHY JEALOUSY AND UNHEALTHY CONTROLLING BEHAVIOUR AND IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO BE AWARE OF
AND THAT'S UNDER REPORTED AND THAT'S ONLY PHYSICAL ABUSE SO THE REAL NUMBER IS MUCH HIGHER
BUT FOR EVERY ONE OF THOSE NEGATIVE MESSAGES I RECEIVE THOUSANDS OF MESSAGES FILLED WITH LOVE
IT CANNOT POSSIBLY HAPPEN TO ME AGAIN
BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE DESERVE ANY LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED PERCENT RESPECT WHEN WE ARE FLAWED WHEN WE
IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S OUT OF MY CONTROL
AND ONE DAY AS I WAS IN MY DILEMMA AND IN MY CONFUSION OF THOUGHTS AND EVERYTHING I WAS
AND THERE WAS A SIGN THERE THAT HAD A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS ON IT
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON
WE'RE MEANT TO HAVE FLAWS
MAYBE IT WOULD WORK
PEOPLE ARE UNCOMFORTABLE WHEN THEY SEE NEW THINGS AND I THINK IT'S OUR JOB AS
I SAID OH I'M FROM NEW YORK
THAT I PROBABLY WOULD NOT LEARN HOW TO SPEAK OR HEAR VERY WELL BUT I WANTED TO TRY
I WANT TO START OFF WITH A QUESTION
I HAVE DREAMS OF GOING TO LAW SCHOOL
I HAVE TWO NOW BY THE WAY I FORGOT TO MENTION
WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY IDEA
YOU ARE WE ALL ARE
THEN I WOULD GO TO MY PRACTICE MY SECOND PRACTICE I WOULD COME HOME AT NINE O'CLOCK AT NIGHT GO STRAIGHT TO
AND I SAW THE RESULTS
MOST OF THE TIME IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE SCARED OR THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND
I HAVE TWO YOUNGER DEAF BROTHERS WHO ARE THE SAME WAY
THE POWER OF THE PEOPLE
AT THAT MOMENT I REALIZED THAT PLANTS HOLD GREAT MEDICINAL POWER
WE CAN'T IMPACT WHAT WE DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY WOULD ANYONE DO THAT
IT IS THE BEST STORAGE DEVICE IN NATURE
CANCER STAGE THREE
THEY COMPLETELY CHANGED THEIR LIFESTYLE AND DIET
I WANT TO DO A SPEECH
DON'T PUT SO MUCH WORK ON YOURSELF
THIS OK WE HAVE TO FIND SOMETHING
WE HAVE TO FIND SOMETHING
THIS IS THE KEY TO THE TECHNOLOGY
THAT'S THE PART THAT'S BROKEN
THESE FLY AUTONOMOUSLY
ONE BILLION PEOPLE IN THE WORLD TODAY DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO ALL SEASON ROADS
THAT'S THE PART THAT WORKS
AND SO WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT CHEMICALS CAN PASS THE PLACENTA AND GO INTO YOUR UNBORN
AND IT'S NOT JUST ATRAZINE THEY'RE EXPOSED TO
IT'S A COMPOUND THAT'S FOUND IN POLYCARBONATE PLASTIC WHICH IS WHAT BABY BOTTLES ARE MADE OUT OF
SO IT REALLY MAKES YOU REALIZE THE ONUS ON PARENTS TO HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS AND REGULATE THIS AND
THAT'S INCREDIBLY POWERFUL TECHNOLOGY
ASTRONAUT BILL ANDERS FRANTICALLY ASKS HIS CREWMATES WHERE THEIR CAMERA IS GRABS THE HASSELBLAD POINTS IT TOWARDS THE
FOR THIS YOU NEED TO RECALL THAT WHENEVER MATTER ANTIMATTER MEET THEY GET TURNED INTO PURE LIGHT
SO LET US ENTERTAIN THE IDEA FOR A WHILE THAT ANTIMATTER BEHAVE SO UNEXPECTEDLY AS TO FALL
MOST LIKELY WE WILL FIND THAT MATTER AND ANTIMATTER FALL IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY IN
SO CHARGE PARITY TRANSFORMS A MATTER WORLD INTO AN ANTIMATTER
BUT IN FACT WE BELIEVE THAT FUNDAMENTAL BUILDING BLOCKS OF NATURE HAVE NO SIZE AT
IN THE EARLY NINETEEN THIRTIES A WHOLE NEW COMPONENT OF MATTER WAS FOUND WHICH IN SOME CELLS BEHAVE
WE CAN DO SO THANKS TO THE HELP OF A MACHINE CALLED THE ANTIPROTON DECELERATOR
I ALMOST NEVER COOK WITH IT
I SAID MIGUEL WHAT MAKES YOUR FISH TASTE SO GOOD
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT FISH
THE PLANT BIOMASS THE PHYTOPLANKTON THE ZOOPLANKTON IT'S WHAT FEEDS THE FISH
FOR THE COMPANY
5 TO ONE HE SAID
BEST IN THE BUSINESS
ALL I GOT WERE EMPTY PROMISES AND DISAPPOINTMENT ENOUGH DISAPPOINTMENT TO FOUND A
AND I HAVE WAITED LONG ENOUGH
TO THE TRADITIONAL BATTLES OF POLITICS
I REMEMBER WHEN MY SON WAS SIX HE HAD A FRIEND OVER TO PLAY
BECAUSE THE WHOLE POINT WAS TO WORK WITH A SIMPLE AGENDA LET'S GET EQUALITY IN EVERY ASPECT OF OUR LIVES
ALL WE HAD WAS A WONDERFUL TIGHT GROUP OF FABULOUS
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT WE DID WE'RE GIVING IT AWAY
AND WHEN THE MEN IN THE RACE SAW HOW MANY VOTES WE WERE ATTRACTING WONDER OF
BECAUSE HERE'S THE CRITICAL THING THE ONE PLACE WOMEN AND MEN ARE ABSOLUTELY EQUAL IS AT THE BALLOT
CAN YOU IMAGINE IF WE COULD MOBILIZE MILLIONS OF WOMEN ACROSS THE WORLD TO
TO SAY STOP THE BICKERING LET'S GET THE WORK DONE
WE WANTED PEOPLE FROM THE LEFT FROM THE RIGHT FROM THE MIDDLE EVERY AGE GROUP
WHAT WE NEED IS A SEISMIC CHANGE IN THE GLOBAL POLITICAL LANDSCAPE
I'VE WAITED LONG ENOUGH IN MY OWN BUSINESS
2016 THE UN WERE LOOKING FOR A BRAND NEW AMBASSADOR TO REPRESENT WOMEN'S
COME ON PEOPLE LET'S ACTIVATE
PEOPLE WROTE AND SAID PLEASE CAN I HELP
THEY WERE IN THE NEXT ROOM I COULD HEAR THEM CHATTING
IN THE END WE SUCCEEDED
I LOVE WHAT I DO BUT I LOVE MY KIDS MORE
BECAUSE THE FACT IS EQUALITY IS BETTER FOR EVERYONE
THEY CANNOT PREVENT THIS
THEY CAN ALSO NOT MEDICATE THEMSELVES
WE USED TO THINK WE'RE ALONE IN THIS BUT NOW WE KNOW WE'RE NOT
SOME OF THE MONARCHS WERE HEALTHY
THEY HAD NO DISEASE
THAT MUST BE NECROPHILIA
SO AFTER SIX YEARS MY FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES URGED ME TO PUBLISH SO I PUBLISHED THE FIRST CASE OF HOMOSEXUAL
HE CALLED ME FROM CAMBRIDGE MASSACHUSETTS
AND THERE'S A LOT OF DISTRACTIONS AROUND US ALL THE TIME AS WE KNOW
SO I WAS THINKING OF AND CREATING WITHIN THE SAME AGE RANGE AS MOST OF YOU AROUND 1516 WHEN I FIRST STARTED
AND AT THAT TIME I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON BECAUSE I WAS REALLY FOCUSED ON SPORTS
WHAT WAS DRAWING ME INTO THIS SOUND
DID YOU EXPERIENCE THAT AT ALL
IS WHAT I'M SAYING TO MYSELF IN MY HEAD IS IT NECESSARY IN THE EXACT MOMENT IN WHAT I'M DOING WITH MY LIFE RIGHT
WE WOULD WANT TO BE SURE IN A PERFECT WORLD THAT THE CHICKS WOULD BE ABLE TO HATCH WALK AROUND AND FEED THEMSELVES
WHAT IF THERE WERE A POSSIBILITY OF BRINGING BIRDS BACK FROM EXTINCTION
WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN
BUT ORNITHOLOGISTS ARE NOT THE ONLY GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT ARE EXCITED ABOUT BIRDS AND BIRD CONSERVATION
MANY ISLANDS HAVE LOST THOSE COMPONENTS
IT'S ABOUT REPRESENTING
LET'S PLAY MORE GAMES
WHAT WE DO IN OUR CULTURE AND WHAT WE SAY ABOUT MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCE IT REALLY MATTERS
WHAT IS GOING ON
I THOUGHT IT WAS DETACHED FROM LIFE
I REALLY WANTED TO COMMUNICATE THAT OUT TO THE WORLD
LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT I'VE DONE
WE SIMPLY DON'T KNOW
IT'S REPRESENTING THESE THINGS IN NUMBERS SO THEY GO BACK TO THE WORLD WITH NEW INSIGHT
WE DID IT TO TELL A DIFFERENT STORY ABOUT PHYSICS AND MATHEMATICS TRYING TO
THAT ENABLES OUR KIDS AND OUR FRIENDS TO FALL IN LOVE WITH SCIENCE
WE HAVE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES THAT IS SO EASY
WHY DO THEY MOVE LIKE THEY MOVE
WE CAN THEN GO TO THE COMPUTER AND SIMULATE THIS BEHAVIOR
I UNDERSTOOD MATHEMATICS IS ABOUT LIFE IT'S ABOUT NATURE IT IS
I COULD DO THE FORMULAS
BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS BORING
I THOUGHT IT WAS COLD
FOR NP COMPLETE PROBLEMS QUANTUM COMPUTERS SEEM TO GIVE YOU SOME ADVANTAGE LIKE
NOW 50 CUBITS IS PROBABLY NOT ENOUGH YET TO DO ANYTHING
BUT WHERE DO THOSE LIMITS COME FROM
BUT FINDING THE ANSWER MIGHT REQUIRE AN ASTRONOMICAL SEARCH
EVEN QUANTUM COMPUTERS HAVE LIMITS
BECAUSE THAT'S THE POSSIBILITY THAT MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO REWRITE ALL THE PHYSICS TEXTBOOKS
WELL WHY ISN'T THAT JUST A FANCY POMPOUS WAY OF SAYING THE CAT IS EITHER ALIVE
IF YOU JUST WANTED A RANDOM ANSWER THEN YOU COULD HAVE PICKED ONE YOURSELF WITH A LOT
OF COURSE BUT IN SOME SENSE THAT'S THE MORE EXCITING POSSIBILITY
THAT DOES SOUND LIKE THAT WOULD CRACK THE NP COMPLETE PROBLEMS OR WHATEVER ELSE
THE TROUBLE IS IT IS NOT THAT SIMPLE
IF WE WERE PHYSICISTS WE WOULD HAVE JUST CALLED THAT A LAW OF NATURE
WHAT A QUANTUM COMPUTER WOULD DO IS PUT FACTORING INTO THAT EASY CLASS
SO FACTORING ALSO WOULD ONLY TAKE ABOUT N SQUARED STEPS FOR AN N DIGIT NUMBER
THAT'S THE SET OF ALL THE PROBLEMS FOR WHICH A DIGITAL COMPUTER COULD AT LEAST QUICKLY RECOGNIZE AN
WHAT HE'D DONE IS EVENTUALLY CONFISCATED 4000 MARKS AS PART OF THE TRIAL AS EVIDENCE IN THE TRIAL AND THEN
AND IN SOME WAYS THAT'S NOT ENTIRELY SURPRISING
EMBOLDENED BY THIS HE HATCHED WHAT PROBABLY REMAINS I THINK ONE OF THE BALLSIEST CRIMINAL
SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY YES AND SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY NO
WE DO LIVE IN A WORLD WHICH IS OVERLY IMPRESSED BY SUPERFICIAL CHARACTERISTICS LIKE YOUR TITLE OR YOUR
ALL OF US STRIVE TO DISGUISE OUR FLAWS IN THE EYES OF OTHER PEOPLE
SO IT DEEPENS THE ANXIETY
HE MARCHED THE SOLDIERS DOWN TO THE LOCAL RAILWAY STATION AND THEY TRAVELED ALL THE WAY TO K PENICK WHICH IS A TOWN
PRESUMABLY IT JUST LAYS SO FAR OUTSIDE THE REALM OF THIS GUY'S IMAGINATION THAT A SOLDIER IN THE BRITISH
IT ALSO WORKED BECAUSE OF THE POWER OF NARRATIVE
SO WE NEED A NEW STORY
THEY TELL US WHO WE ARE THE MEANING OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AROUND US WHERE WE CAME FROM AND THEY GIVE US SOME GUIDANCE
MY GRANDMOTHER WAS NOT MY GRANDFATHER'S FIRST CHOICE IN MARRIAGE
YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID
THOSE STORIES THAT ARE SO BIG THAT WE LIVE INSIDE THEM
THEY SUPPRESS SOME VOICES AND THEY ELEVATE OTHERS
WHAT SHOULD WE DO WHEN THAT PLACE THAT WE CALL THE WEST AND THAT PLACE THAT WE CALL ISLAM CAN'T
WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN THE EUROPEAN UNION WHICH WAS A SHARED DREAM CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO
AND THAT IS WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE NOT ONLY RESPONSIBLE POLITICAL LEADERSHIP BUT ONE THAT UNDERSTANDS
THE SAME THING THREE THINGS THAT ALL SUCCESSFUL SOCIETAL NARRATIVES HAVE
BUT THEY'RE NOT EXACTLY DEMOCRATICALLY PERFECT EXAMPLES OF CROWDSOURCING EITHER
I MEAN REALLY HOW DID MY GRANDMOTHER WHO GREW UP IN A VILLAGE IN A COUNTRY THAT WOULD BECOME TURKEY KNOW OF
THERE ARE LOTS OF STORIES LOTS OF WAYS OF THINKING LOTS OF CODES LOTS OF SYMBOLS AND THEY'RE ALL
THE OTHER REASON WE NEED STORIES THAT OFFER US A CHOICE IS BECAUSE WHEN WE HAVE HARD PROBLEMS OR
IT WORKED BECAUSE OF A POWERFUL NARRATIVE WE CAN NAME IT THE AMERICAN DREAM
THEY ACTUALLY HAD ALREADY BEEN TOLD THAT THEY COULD TAKE THE 250 WHICH THEY HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO TAKE WITH THEM FROM
AND SHE SAID THE FOLLOWING
AND I SWEAR THE FIRST THING WE'LL DO WHEN WE GO TO AMERICA IS WE'LL START TO WORK AND WE'LL PAY
AND WE DON'T REALLY BUY STORIES ANYMORE IN WHICH WE ARE TOLD THE END AND WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO SORT OF LEAVE OUT
BUT I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WINE
A WINE LABEL
THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH
THIS IS HOW SCIENCE LEARNS
SARCOMA IS A VERY RARE FORM OF CANCER
REMEMBER THAT A ONE IN A MILLION DIAGNOSIS IF IT HAPPENS TWICE IN ONE FAMILY IS
I REMEMBER BEING YOUNG I WOULD WALK DOWN THE HALLWAYS OF MY SCHOOL AND I WOULD TAP RHYTHMS TO MYSELF ON MY LEG WITH MY
AND SEVERAL DIFFERENT SCIENTIFIC TEAMS WERE WONDERING BUT WHY
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT
THIS IS THE ONLY WAY WE'LL GET THROUGH THIS
SO THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS VIRUSES IN THE WORLD
AND HE SAW IT
WHAT'S THE NEXT THING TO COME FORWARD
MOSTLY VERY VERY GREAT WONDERFUL THINGS YOU WOULD SAY THAT'S TERRIFIC
THEY CANNOT SHOOT AN UNARMED TEENAGER DEAD
ONE OF THE GREAT CARICATURISTS OF AMERICA ED SOREL ONCE
MY EDITOR CAME IN ONE DAY AND SAID
THEY CANNOT KNOCK OUT A WOMAN IN AN ELEVATOR
STARTING HUMBLY FROM THAT LOVELY QUEER POOL PARTY FIVE YEARS AGO WE'VE EXPANDED TO REGULAR EVENTS
IT IS A LINK IT IS BRINGING TOGETHER THOSE MANY ISLANDS
MORE CONTEMPORANEOUSLY WE MIGHT THINK OF THE SPRAWLING SUBURBIA WHERE THOUSANDS OF HOUSES
TWELVE YOUNG GAY AND LESBIAN KIDS CAME TOGETHER FOR A DAY OF SUMMERTIME FUN
WE ALSO PROVIDE THOSE MEANINGFUL LINKS AND CONNECTIONS TO COMMUNITY RESOURCES AND
NOT ONLY ARE WE ABLE TO USE THE INTERNET AS A MEDIUM OF EXCHANGE IT IS A FACILITATOR A
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
WE HAVE GROWN FROM THAT FIRST SMALL GAY POOL PARTY OF TWELVE AND
THE QNYN IS DIVIDED INTO THREE SUBGROUPS
THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECRECY IN OUR GROUP ENSURES THAT THOSE SAFE AND OPEN SPACES ARE
THE ALPHABET SOUP OF L G B T Q Q I A HAS
WE ARE I CAN HAPPILY TELL YOU THE ONLY PEER LED LGBT YOUTH ORGANIZATION OF ITS KIND IN THE COUNTRY
OUR FIRST EVENT I CAN RECALL OLD PHOTOS OF OUR FIRST SOCIAL EVENT BACK IN JUNE 2010 IT WAS A POOL PARTY
OPEN YOUR EYES
THAT'S WHAT ENGINEERS BUILD
YOU NEED TO APPLY
SO WHY DOES THIS MATTER
THE WORLD WAS WAITING FOR THIS
WE'RE NOT IN A MOVIE
I SAID YEAH YEAH
ONLY 11 PERCENT OF ENGINEERS IN THE U
HOW EMPOWERING TO BE ABLE TO BUILD WHATEVER YOU WANT
AND I WAS SO WORRIED THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE MY FIRST F
SHE SAID OKAY DEBBIE WHAT DO YOU PLAN TO MAJOR IN
I KNOW YOU WILL
AND THEY GET THEM INTERESTED IN MATH AND SCIENCE
DO YOU TRUST ME
JUST BECAUSE THIS IS THE WAY THINGS ARE DOESN'T MEAN IT'S HOW THEY HAVE TO BE
AND IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE INCLUDE THAT PERSPECTIVE
AND WHAT AN AMAZING SKILL SET
AND WITH HALF THE POPULATION BEING FEMALE WE DESERVE TO HAVE THE FEMALE PERSPECTIVE
IT WILL ONLY GET BETTER WITH THE FEMALE PERSPECTIVE
AND SO I WOULD SAY WELL WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE TOY
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
I DIDN'T EVEN GO TO ANY PARTIES WORKING ON MY DRAWING
BUT I STUCK WITH IT
I LOVED THE MAJOR AND I WANTED TO DO IT
IT COULDN'T BE MORE REWARDING
AND OUR FINAL ASSIGNMENT WE HAD TO PUT OUR DRAWINGS UP ON THE WALL FOR CRITIQUE
YOU CAN DO IT AND I'LL HELP YOU
I HAVE A DEGREE
AND IT WAS PROBABLY THE MOST UNHAPPY YEAR OF MY LIFE
SO TO GET MORE WOMAN INVOLVED IS A HUGE PROBLEM FOR WIKIPEDIA
THAT'S THE MODEL THAT YOU HAVE
ANY TIME ANY PLACE ANY WAY THAT YOU MEASURE IT IT'S BEEN BETWEEN 88 TO
IT WAS THE SUM OF ALL HUMAN KNOWLEDGE THAT WAS THE GOAL OF THIS ENCYCLOPEDIA BUT THERE'D BE A COMPANY THAT HELD THE COPYRIGHT BUT ALLOW ANYONE
WOMEN SCIENTISTS THE GENDER GAP
THEY RAISE MONEY EVERY YEAR TO PAY THE NEXT YEAR'S BILLS
10 OF ITS POPULATION MURDERED WITH MORE THAN HALF OF ITS POPULATION STILL LIVING IN
SOME OF MY HAPPIEST CHILDHOOD MEMORIES WERE SIMPLY GETTING TO COME HOME EVERY DAY FROM SCHOOL TO BE GIVEN A
TURMOIL LETS OUT THE FIGHT IN ME
YOU CHARGE ANOTHER INMATE TO CLEAN HIS CELL
I LOST A YEAR OF MY LIFE FROM IT
THAT WAS MY FULL TIME JOB UNLOADING TRUCKS AT A FOOD WAREHOUSE FOR 5
THERE'S PRETTY ILLEGAL HUSTLES YOU RUN A TATTOO PARLOR OUT OF YOUR OWN CELL
THOSE ARE THE CURRENCY
FOR THE MOST PART EVERYONE WAS JUST TRYING TO SURVIVE
AND IT'S HARD FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS
I UNLOADED TRUCKS
THE LAST TIME I WAS AT HIS HOUSE HIS BROTHER SAID HANG ON A SECOND DANIEL'S NOT READY
THIS IS DESIGN
YOU WANT TO DESIGN A NEW FRAME FOR A DRONE
ALL OF MY RELATIONSHIPS HAVE FAILED
MOREOVER I THINK IT CAN TRANSFORM SOCIETY
IT'S TOTALLY DOMINATED BY WORK
YOU WANT ME TO GO TO CHURCH AND CALL MY MOTHER
I WORK 10 HOURS A DAY I COMMUTE TWO HOURS A DAY
IT'S UP TO US AS INDIVIDUALS TO TAKE CONTROL AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TYPE OF
WALK THE DOG
UP UNTIL THAT MOMENT I HAD BEEN THAT CLASSIC CORPORATE WARRIOR I WAS EATING TOO MUCH I WAS DRINKING TOO MUCH I
NOW MACHINES HAVE THE ABILITY TO STORE AN UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF
EXERCISING FOR THE SAKE OF VANITY NEVER MOTIVATED ME BECAUSE I JUST FIGURE PLUS OR MINUS TEN TWENTY POUNDS WHO CARES
BEING SOCIAL IS INCREDIBLY GOOD FOR YOU
SOMEONE'S TEXTING IN THE CAR TELL THEM TO PULL OVER
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO TRY TO KEEP TRACK OF THE STUFF YOURSELF
SO LEARN BALLROOM DANCING
THEY TRACKED 600078 NUNS OVER THE COURSE OF THEIR LIVES AND A LOT OF THE NUNS EVEN GAVE
SO IT'S NOT GOOD FOR YOU
TALK BACK TO IT
IF YOU HAVE A THYROID PROBLEM THAT ACTUALLY MAKES THE THYROID PROBLEM WORSE
DEPENDING ON WHO YOU ASK ONLY 5 TO 8 OF ALZHEIMER'S IS LINKED TO A SINGLE GENE TO BEGIN WITH
YOU WANT SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS PREVENTION UNDERSTANDS NUTRITION UNDERSTANDS EXERCISE UNDERSTANDS THE IMPORTANCE OF
YOU CAN LEARN A NEW INSTRUMENT A COMPLICATED DANCE OR LANGUAGE
ORG IS GREAT
THERE'S A WEBSITE CALLED COSMETICSDATABASE
SO YOU ACTUALLY END UP FILLING UP WITH THAT AND LOSING WEIGHT
SO DON'T WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT TAKING NOTES
STRESS REWIRES YOUR BRAIN
I WAS WORKING AT THIS DAY JOB FUNDING ANTI
I KNOW THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT BUT ACTUALLY IT'S REALLY HARD TO GAIN WEIGHT WITH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES
IN GENERAL THE COMPANY DONATES 20 OF ITS PRETAX PROFIT TO CHARITY
I ENDED UP LEAVING SHORTLY THEREAFTER
I MEAN OUR BASIC GOAL IS TO IMPROVE LIVES AROUND THE WORLD
SO PICK ANY CAUSE THAT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU AND GO OUT THERE AND DO IT
THEY FOUND THAT THE NUNS WHO HAD THE HIGHEST USAGE OF POSITIVE EMOTION
SO ALWAYS WEAR YOUR SEAT BELT
IF YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS IF YOU JUST MOVED IF YOUR FRIENDS ARE NEGATIVE AND YOU'RE GETTING RID OF THEM AFTER THE LAST TIPS THAT
EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT LEAD IN SMOKING
THEY'RE BEING POISONED
MEDITERRANEAN DIET INVOLVES SEVEN TO TEN SERVINGS OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES PER DAY
THAT'S MY JOB
SO A GOOD DOCTOR KNOWS THAT
IN THE US WHAT THAT MEANS IS SPONSORING ALZHEIMER'S PREVENTION RESEARCH AND
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I'M INCREDIBLY LAZY WHEN IT COMES TO EXERCISING
IF YOU'RE IN L
FIRST OFF I'M NOT A DOCTOR
SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING
ALWAYS PICK A SAFER CARD MAKE THAT ONE OF YOUR PRIMARY SCREENINGS AND NEVER TEXT WHILE YOU'RE DRIVING
I MAKE GAMES FOR A LIVING
AND A GOOD DOCTOR KNOWS HOW TO DO THAT
AGINGGAMES AND IT WAS REALLY STRESSFUL AS I WAS READING THE STUDY ABOUT HOW STRESS SHRINKS YOUR BRAIN
AND HE'S DOING REMARKABLY WELL
MY FIRST JOB OUT OF COLLEGE WAS WRITING GUIDEBOOKS TO FABULOUS PLACES IN EUROPE
I WAS FRIGHTENED OF HOSPITALS
THEY HAVE ENORMOUS PURCHASING POWER
HERE ARE SOME FACTS
THEY'RE JUST AS ADDICTED TO FOSSIL FUELS AS THE REST OF THE ECONOMY
AND THE OTHER PROBLEM WAS I HARDLY KNEW ANYBODY WHO WORKED IN THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR
LIKE MANY PEOPLE I WAS HORRIFIED AND MOVED BY THE PHOTOS FROM
HOW ARE WE GOING TO STOP THE EPIDEMIC OF CANCER AND OTHER CHRONIC DISEASES THAT WE ALL
BUT I HAD TWO PROBLEMS IN STARTING THIS ORGANIZATION
IN OTHER WORDS IF THE PATIENT SIMPLY DOES NOT LIKE THE BRACE SHE WON'T WEAR THE BRACE AND IF SHE DOESN'T WEAR THE BRACE
BY HER ENGAGING IN THE PRODUCT'S CREATION THAT IS FOR HER BODY SHE WILL THEN LIKE IT
THEY AMPLIFY EACH OTHER
IT'S THE ONLY ONE OF ITS KIND
SHE'S ABLE TO WALK
IT RE WRITES THE WAY WE DESIGN A PRODUCT
WHAT WOULD IT TAKE FOR US TO FALL IN LOVE WITH THOSE PRODUCTS THAT ARE HERE TO SERVE US
BUT WHAT IF WE SHOOK THINGS UP A BIT
WHAT IF WE CHANGED THIS ALL
HER RESPONSE WAS YOU CAN'T
THAT'S WHY I LIKE WHAT I DO
BUT THERE ARE CHALLENGES HERE
WHAT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO IS INVEST IN NEW ANTIBIOTICS IN WAYS THAT ACTUALLY
WE'VE GOT TO SLOW THE PACE OF COEVOLUTION DOWN AND THERE ARE IDEAS THAT WE CAN BORROW FROM
WE DON'T WANT TO JUST THROW MONEY AT A PROBLEM
AN OPTION IS TO GO THROUGH THAT RETHINKING AND CAREFULLY CONSIDER INCENTIVES TO CHANGE HOW WE DO
BUT WHAT IS THAT REALLY TELLING US
IF WE TAUGHT DOCTORS HOW NOT TO USE ANTIBIOTICS AS MUCH IF WE TAUGHT PATIENTS HOW NOT TO DEMAND ANTIBIOTICS PERHAPS
THIS IS WHAT ECONOMISTS MIGHT CALL A PROBLEM OF THE COMMONS AND THE PROBLEM OF THE COMMONS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE FACE IN THE CASE OF
NOW THIS IS CLEARLY NOT A GAME THAT CAN BE SUSTAINED OR ONE THAT WE CAN WIN BY SIMPLY INNOVATING TO STAY AHEAD
AND IF WE CAN TEACH LISTENING IN OUR SCHOOLS WE CAN TAKE OUR LISTENING OFF THAT SLIPPERY SLOPE TO THAT DANGEROUS
NOW THAT'S SOMETHING I FALL SHORT OF ON A DAILY BASIS
JUST THREE MINUTES A DAY OF SILENCE IS A WONDERFUL EXERCISE TO RESET YOUR EARS AND TO
WE CAN CATEGORIZE IT LIKE THAT
WHERE DO WE LIKE TO KISS PEOPLE
THEY NEED PSYCHIATRIC HELP
MAX HAS KINDLY DONATED HIS PHOTOGRAPH TO ME
BUT I DO THINK IT'S PLAUSIBLE THAT ONE DAY WE WILL HAVE THE EXPERTISE TO IDENTIFY DIFFERENT BRAIN
WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE THIS OUT BECAUSE WE NOW LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE EXTREMISTS GUIDED BY THEIR MORAL
SO TAKING THIS IDEA FURTHER MY COLLEAGUES ALSO LOOKED AT WHETHER SEROTONIN LEVELS INFLUENCE THE WAY THAT WE RESPOND
THOSE WHO READ THE ARTICLE ABOUT CHANGEABLE GROUPS WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE WILLING TO MEET WITH THE OTHER SIDE
WE DECIDED TO SEE IF WE COULD CHANGE THEIR MINDSET
AND PERSONALLY I SURVIVED DEATH MORE THAN TEN TIMES FROM MORTARS
BUT I MANAGED TO ACHIEVE MY TARGET AGAIN A GPA OF 3
I'M NOT GOING TO WASTE MY TIME ANY MORE ON THESE THINGS
I USED TO LIVE IN A PLACE WHERE THE SOUND OF MORTARS BULLETS JET FIGHTERS AND MISSILES DON T
EVENTUALLY I SURVIVED THAT DAY AND THE BATTLE DIDN'T REACH MY AREA
I NEEDED TO LEARN HOW TO WRITE ESSAYS MOTIVATION LETTERS PERSONAL STATEMENTS FILLING APPLICATIONS ALL OF THESE THINGS
AND I STRUGGLED TO LEARN THE LANGUAGE
WE HAVE TAKEN ON SUCH ENORMOUS DEBTS SINCE THE FINANCIAL CRISIS BUT HAVE WE INVESTED THEM
CHINA AND JAPAN HAVE AN EVEN LONGER HISTORY OF RIVALRY AND HAVE BEEN DEPLOYING THEIR AIR FORCES AND NAVIES TO SHOW THEIR
IT TELLS US THAT LANDLOCKED COUNTRIES ARE CONDEMNED TO BE POOR THAT SMALL COUNTRIES CANNOT ESCAPE
NOW LET'S STOP AND THINK ABOUT IT FOR A MINUTE
THAT IS AS MANY AS THE NUMBER OF INTERGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT WE HAVE
IT'S SOMETHING YOU ARE
HERE'S THE PROBLEM
RESPONSIBILITY IS NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU DO
LET NETFLIX THINK AND ACT FOR YOU
IS THIS WHAT WE WANT
WHAT I WANT TO FOCUS ON SPECIFICALLY IS WHAT I SEE AS THE DOMINANT TREND IN TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION TODAY
AND THEY RUSH BACK HOME
SO I MAKE A BUNCH OF PHONE CALLS I BUY A TICKET OF COURSE
WITHIN 72 HOURS I'M ON A PLANE HEADING NORTH
AND HOW CAN MEN TAME EAGLES
I WAS DESPERATE TO GO AND FIND OUT FOR MYSELF
THAT WAS MY CUE
99 SPY ON YOUR EX GIRLFRIEND SOFTWARE ONLINE
IT'S REALLY TERRIFYING
THE LAST LESSON IS THE BIG ONE
PRACTICE IS THE WAY TO A GREAT INSTRUMENT
IT'S WHAT THE GREEKS CALLED THE CENTER OF ALL EXPRESSION
ALL SONG IS OUR BREATH
MAYBE ESPECIALLY FOR WOMEN
HE GOES BACK TO THE ASSEMBLY
HE WANTED TO BE AN ORATOR
HE BUILDS HIMSELF AN UNDERGROUND CELLAR
THE POWER OF PRACTICE
IN FACT SHE ALSO READ A POEM THAT SHE HAD WRITTEN WHEN THEY FIRST MET
WITHIN YOUR BODY IS SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY THE KING OF THE BODY
PUT YOUR HANDS UP IF YOU THOUGHT ABOUT YOUR DIAPHRAGM TODAY
I GOT HOW IT SHOULD FEEL
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYBODY
WE'VE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE DIAPHRAGM
IT TELLS YOU ABOUT PRACTICE
SUDDENLY I GOT IT
THE ROMANS UNDERSTOOD THIS
BUT WHEN YOU ASK A MAKER TO MAKE A CHEST OF DRAWERS THEY DON'T ALWAYS DO WHAT YOU THINK THEY ARE GOING TO DO
WE LIVE IN A REALLY VISUAL CULTURE
WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME IF YOU THINK ABOUT TWO WORLDS WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME THINKING ABOUT THE OUTSIDE
THEN HE GOES BACK
SO WE THOUGHT OK IF YOU CAN DO THIS REALLY FOR PEOPLE USING PROSTHETIC DEVICES AND WE CAN GET THEM INTO RUNNING IN
WE HAD A NICE HOUSE
WHY THIS FEAR OF AUTISM
ACCEPTANCE IS PROACTIVE
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO DO THAT
WE WERE GIVEN HOMEWORK TO DO OUR PARENTS WERE INTERVIEWED OUR FRIENDS WERE INTERVIEWED AND IT WAS ALL
HE BELIEVES OUR MISSION IN LIFE IS TO NAG HIM AND TO STOP HIM FROM DOING EVERYTHING HE REALLY WANTS TO
THERE ARE AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO WILL DISAPPROVE OF THIS VERY VERY STRONGLY AND YOU NEED
WE ROPE IN THE HUSBANDS OF OUR FRIENDS AND WE ROPE IN OUR OWN MALE FRIENDS AND
HE THINKS WE'RE TOTALLY EMBARRASSING
THAT WAS IT
AND STEVEN HAS AN ADOPTIVE FAMILY AND THAT ISN'T JUST EMMA AND MYSELF IT IS
THAT IS GOING TO BE SO HARD
EMMA AND I DO THOSE THINGS
FOR US IT WAS OUR FIRST CHOICE AND IT WAS AN EXCITING NEW BEGINNING
HE IS NOT SOME SORT OF LIFESTYLE ACCESSORY FOR ME
STEVEN HAS LOVELY GRANDDADS HE HAS AMAZING UNCLES COUSINS
WE HAD LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO SAID I'M SORRY
STEVEN HAS A BIRTH FAMILY AND WE HAVE CONTACT WITH THEM
WE WILL DO THOSE THINGS
AND HE WAS RIGHT
MY PARTNER EMMA AND I GOT TO A STAGE IN OUR RELATIONSHIP WHERE WE WANTED TO START A FAMILY LIKE LOTS
IT WAS AMAZING FOR US BUT IT WAS INCREDIBLY POSITIVE FOR STEVEN AT THAT VERY DIFFICULT
HE DOESN'T REALLY WANT TO BE SEEN OUT WITH US IN PUBLIC
AND SO WE KIND OF SKIPPED OFF AND WE STARTED TO TELL FRIENDS AND FAMILY THAT WE WANTED TO ADOPT
WOULD YOU LIKE A JOB OR WOULD YOU LIKE A FAMILY
SO WHAT DO WE DO NEXT
AND THAT WAS AMAZING
I DON'T KNOW WHO TALKS LIKE THAT BUT THAT'S JUST IN MY MIND
WOULD YOU LIKE TO PAINT FOR MY MUSIC VIDEO
PEOPLE STOPPED ME IN THE STREET
MAMA THAT'S WHAT I CALL MY GRANDMOTHER TOLD ME MANY STORIES ABOUT YORUBA MYTHOLOGY
PEOPLE FEATURED ME IN MAGAZINES INTERVIEWS
YOU SEE THE YORUBAS ARE AN ETHNIC GROUP FROM THE SOUTHWESTERN PART OF NIGERIA AND I WAS ALWAYS FASCINATED BY THESE
AND THEN SHE TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY SYMBOLS FROM THE YORUBA MYTHOLOGY
WHY DON'T YOU DRAW LIKE OTHER PEOPLE
WHY DON'T YOU DRAW LANDSCAPES OR MAYBE YOU DRAW CHAIRS OR FURNITURE OR MAYBE EVEN DRAW
WE'RE JUST FRIENDS
I WAS A SOPHOMORE IN HIGH SCHOOL 15 YEARS OLD AT THE TIME
LABELING REFUGEES AS POISON TO OUR SOCIETIES BOUND TO ONLY BRING OUR LIVES HARM
SYRIA IS CURRENTLY IN THE MIDST OF A CONFLICT AND GENOCIDE THAT HAS TAKEN THE LIVES OF
TO BE SPEAKING ABOUT AN ISSUE THAT NEVER STRAYS FAR FROM MIND
JUST AS THE CIVILIAN OPPOSITION HAS BEEN DROWNED OUT BY THE TYRANNY OF THE ASSAD REGIME AND THE RADICAL
THAT'S EVERY 11 MINUTES
VANESSA AND I WERE IN FORT LAUDERDALE
WHY IS WHAT'S OUT THERE NOT WORKING FOR THEM
BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU THE STATISTICS
WE ASKED OURSELVES THAT SAME QUESTION
LET ME GRAB SOME SUPPLIES
LET ME RALLY MY TEAM
AND THEN JUST DAYS AFTER THAT I GOT MY STEPS IN TODAY FOR MY BABY NORM
SO WE STUDIED MODELS LIKE WANGARI MAATHAI WHO WON THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE FOR INSPIRING WOMEN TO PLANT 50 MILLION TREES IN
82 PERCENT OF BLACK WOMEN ARE OVER A HEALTHY WEIGHT RIGHT NOW
THE QUESTION HURTS ME
I'M SHAKING A LITTLE BIT
BUT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT AND INVITE YOU INTO AN INSIDE CONVERSATION TODAY BECAUSE IT IS NECESSARY AND
SO CONSCIOUSNESS IS AN ILLUSION
NOW I HAVEN'T YET GIVEN YOU A DEFINITION
ANY HARDWARE WILL DO PROVIDED IT'S RICH ENOUGH AND STABLE ENOUGH TO CARRY THE PROGRAM
NOW WHAT THAT TELLS US IS THAT OUR TRADITIONAL VOCABULARIES FOR DISCUSSING THESE ISSUES ARE
TWO WELL MAYBE IT EXISTS BUT IT'S REALLY SOMETHING ELSE
OR IS IT OBSERVER RELATIVE
DREAMS ARE A FORM OF CONSCIOUSNESS ON THIS DEFINITION
AND THE MESSAGE I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH IS CONSCIOUSNESS HAS TO BECOME ACCEPTED AS A
THAT'S GOING ON NO MATTER WHAT ANYBODY THINKS
BUT FOR THAT DISTINCTION BETWEEN HOW THINGS CONSCIOUSLY SEEM AND HOW THEY REALLY ARE YOU CAN'T MAKE THAT DISTINCTION FOR
ONE CONSCIOUSNESS DOES NOT EXIST
YOU CAN'T GET RID OF IT
NOW WHY IS THAT CURIOUS
PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY CONSCIOUSNESS IS VERY HARD TO DEFINE
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU HOW THAT'S POSSIBLE
IS THAT ABSOLUTE LIKE FORCE AND MASS AND GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION
NOW WHENEVER SOMEBODY TELLS ME THAT I THINK YOU WANT TO SEE SPIRITUALITY MOVE SOMETHING
WE'RE NOT READY FOR A SCIENTIFIC DEFINITION BUT HERE'S A COMMON SENSE DEFINITION
NOW THAT'S THE COMMON SENSE DEFINITION
BUT WE KNOW THAT THAT'S PURELY SYNTACTICAL
SO THE OBJECTION THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE AN OBJECTIVE SCIENCE OF CONSCIOUSNESS BECAUSE IT'S
AND JUST AS THE JAR FULL OF WATER CAN GO FROM LIQUID TO SOLID DEPENDING ON THE BEHAVIOR
BUT WHEN I HAUL OUT MY POCKET CALCULATOR AND DO THE CALCULATION THE ONLY INTRINSIC PHENOMENON
ONE AND THE SAME EVENT HAS A LEVEL OF DESCRIPTION WHERE IT'S NEUROBIOLOGICAL AND ANOTHER LEVEL OF
I ADD TWO PLUS TWO TO GET FOUR
IT'S REALLY A DIGITAL COMPUTER PROGRAM RUNNING IN YOUR BRAIN AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO CREATE
YOU CAN'T DO THIS IF YOU DON'T GIVE A DEFINITION
I WON'T DEMONSTRATE PAIN BEHAVIOR BUT I CAN TELL YOU I'M NOT HAVING ANY PAINS RIGHT NOW
IT'S A COMPUTER PROGRAM RUNNING IN THE BRAIN
HOW COULD SPIRITUALITY MOVE ANYTHING
SINCE WE DON'T KNOW HOW OUR BRAINS DO IT WE'RE NOT IN A POSITION SO FAR TO BUILD A CONSCIOUS MACHINE
IF YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT CONSCIOUSNESS
I GAVE YOU A SCIENTIFIC DEMONSTRATION BY RAISING MY HAND BUT HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN COMPUTATION IS ARBITRARY
IT'S AN ILLUSION LIKE SUNSETS
THERE'S ANOTHER TRADITION THAT THINKS IT'S OPPOSED TO THIS BUT ACCEPTS THE WORST ASSUMPTION
BUT WE HAVE THIS PERSISTENT CONFUSION BETWEEN OBJECTIVITY AND SUBJECTIVITY AS FEATURES OF
YOU'RE GIVING UP ON 300 YEARS OF HUMAN PROGRESS AND HUMAN HOPE AND ALL THE REST OF IT
YEAH FORGET ABOUT THE HARDWARE
AND I'M GOING TO GO THROUGH SOME OF THEM
MAYBE WE'LL BE ABLE TO BUILD A CONSCIOUS MACHINE
SO I DON'T JUST HAVE THE SIGHT OF THE PEOPLE IN FRONT OF ME AND THE SOUND OF MY VOICE AND THE WEIGHT OF MY SHOES AGAINST THE FLOOR
THAT'S OUR TARGET
DO LIFE SCIENCES HAVE DRAMA
AND WE SAID WELL THE FIRST ERECTION WOULD TAKE ONE WEEK
BECAUSE OF THIS WE ARE PRIVILEGED
IT WAS ONLY IN 1952 WHEN THE HERSHEY CHASE EXPERIMENT CONFIRMED THAT DNA WAS A MOLECULE THAT
AS I SPEAK THE BIOTECH COMPANY BIOVIVA IS CONDUCTING THE FIRST HUMAN
DINOSAUR CLONES WOULD BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND THIS CHANGE IN OXYGEN CONTENT WITHOUT SUFFERING OXYGEN
AND THAT ACTUALLY MAKES REPURPOSING PRETTY HARD FOR ALL OF US WHICH IS I GUESS WHY THEY GAVE A TV SHOW
SO WE DID WHAT YOU DO IN SCIENCE WHEN YOU'RE NOT SURE AND WE RAN IT AGAIN
THEY HAVE TWO OTHER THINGS IN COMMON THAT ARE REALLY IMPORTANT
IT WAS TRADITIONALLY USED AS ANESTHESIA IN SURGERY
AND MENTAL SET IS ANOTHER THING
IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THAT SURPRISING THEY WERE CAUGHT
AND WE ONLY PUBLISHED THIS A YEAR AGO BUT SINCE THEN OTHER LABS HAVE INDEPENDENTLY CONFIRMED THIS EFFECT
THAT MEANS NO MATTER HOW MUCH TIME OR MONEY OR EFFORT WE PUT INTO IT IT WILL NEVER
IT DIDN'T REALLY LOOK RIGHT TO ME
AND LIKE I SAID WE ONLY GAVE A TINY AMOUNT OF THE DRUG AND IT LASTED FOR WEEKS AND THAT'S NOT LIKE ANYTHING YOU
5 TRILLION DOLLARS AND SINCE THEY ARE CHRONIC THAT COST IS COMPOUNDING AND IS THEREFORE
SO WE RAN IT AGAIN
AND THAT'S IN THE PATIENTS WHERE THEY DO WORK
A PAINKILLER WILL MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER BUT IS NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING TO TREAT THAT UNDERLYING DISEASE
THAT'S SORT OF THIS PRECONCEIVED FRAMEWORK WITH WHICH WE APPROACH PROBLEMS
AND THIS SORT OF REPURPOSING IS ACTUALLY QUITE CHALLENGING
WHEN DOCTORS FIRST SAW THIS MOOD ENHANCING EFFECT OF IPRONIAZID THEY DIDN'T REALLY RECOGNIZE WHAT THEY
THEY WERE SO USED TO LOOKING AT IT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THIS ONE DISEASE THEY COULD NOT SEE THE LARGER
MANY SELFIES MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE OF EXPERTISE OR NOT HAVE A BLUR WITHIN THE IMAGE ITSELF
MOST OF THE SPEAKERS ARE IN THEIR LATE 50S OR OLDER
WHEN THE CHEROKEE WERE FORCED OUT OF THEIR TRADITIONAL LANDS IN THE SOUTH EAST INTO WHAT WAS THEN INDIAN TERRITORY
TOHONO O'ODHAM COMMUNITY ACTION IS A NON PROFIT IT'S ENGAGED IN THE LANGUAGE AND CULTURAL
TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF INFORMATION IS STORED AND ENCODED IN LANGUAGE
WE HAD HER HERE ON THE UT ARLINGTON CAMPUS AND WERE ABLE TO USE TECHNOLOGY TO HELP CREATE MATERIALS THAT CAN BE
THE O'ODHAM HAVE SOME OF THE HIGHEST IBD RATES IN THE WORLD AND RECLAIMING THAT CULTURAL CONNECTION CAN
THE HUMAN SPIRIT CRAVES THAT CONNECTION TO ANCESTORS BUT THE HUMAN SPIRIT ALSO HAS GREAT
AND UT ARLINGTON'S NATIVE AMERICAN LANGUAGES LAB WAS PARTNER ON THAT PROJECT AND SO WE WERE VERY
CEREMONIES TRADITIONAL GAMES IT'S ALL ABOUT HEALTH AND LIFE WAYS AND FINDING THAT WHOLENESS
THE STORY OF THE SEA LEVEL CHANGE
IN THE HOME FOR CHILD REARING WHERE PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS AND CHILDREN ENGAGE IN DAILY
FOR EXAMPLE PLAYING CARDS WITH THE LANGUAGE ALLOW THE GRANDPARENTS PARENTS AND
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT LANGUAGE
AND MUCH OF THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL HISTORY OF THE LAST 200 YEARS INVOLVED WHAT TO DO WITH
YOU COULD NEVER DO IT WITH CHIMPANZEES
IN MOST TASKS AND WILL MAKE HUMANS REDUNDANT
BUT OVER THE CENTURIES WE HAVE CONSTRUCTED ON TOP OF THIS OBJECTIVE
THERE IS BASICALLY JUST ONE WAY IN WHICH A BEEHIVE CAN FUNCTION
WHAT KIND OF CHIMPANZEE ARE YOU
WHAT EXACTLY ARE THESE THINGS
AND WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT THE BAD GUYS HAVE A WEALTH OF POSSIBILITIES WHEN THEY WANT TO
WE CAN ALL LEARN TO BE ANONYMOUS WHEN WE CHOOSE TO BE
BECAUSE NO TERRORIST WORTH THEIR SALT IS GOING TO GIVE ANYTHING AWAY IN AN E MAIL OR ON THE
HOW WOULD THEY KNOW
THIS IS FAR MORE SERIOUS
BUT WE CAN MOVE FROM THE DEEP WEB
IF YOU ARE NOT PAYING YOU ARE THE PRODUCT
WE SHOULD ALL BE SAYING
AND EVEN IF YOU THINK SOMETHING'S FREE IT INVARIABLY ISN'T
AND IT'S TRUE WHEN THEY SAY
OSAMA BIN LADEN DID NOT HAVE A FACEBOOK PAGE
HOW DO THEY DO THAT
WE ALL KNOW WE'VE BEEN MONITORED ALL OF THE TIME
THIS ULTIMATELY IS GOING TO HAVE A TERRIBLE EFFECT ON THE INTERNET AND IT MIGHT GET TO THE POINT WHERE PEOPLE
SO IT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE DELIGHTS OF MY ENTIRE CAREER
YOU HAVE TO FIRE THIS GUY
WHEN I WAS A CHILD OR WHEN I GET OLD
NOW WHEN I WAS GETTING INVOLVED WHEN I SAID YES TO THIS I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS
NOT ONE MENTION OF OUR MORAL AND PROFESSIONAL OBLIGATION OF PREVENTING HARM TO THE PUBLIC
THIS IS WHAT I CAME TO GRADUATE SCHOOL FOR AND THIS IS HOW I WOULD RATHER SPEND MY LIFE
HE WAS CHARACTERIZED A ROGUE EMPLOYEE AND SILENCED
THIS WAS SCIENCE AND SERVICE TO THE PUBLIC
THERE ARE REAL AND SOMETIMES VERY PAINFUL CONSEQUENCES OF SPEAKING UP
IT WASN'T UNTIL I ARRIVED IN GRADUATE SCHOOL AND WITNESSED FIRSTHAND THE CRIMINAL ACTIONS OF
EVERYONE WAS EXPECTED TO FOLLOW ORDERS COMING FROM THE TOP
YOU KNOW WE FELL IN LOVE WITH SCIENCE WHEN WE WERE KIDS AND YET WE SOMEHOW SPEND MOST OF OUR TIME DURING HIGH
I'M NOT SAYING EVERY SCIENTIST SHOULD BE AN ACTIVIST
THIS GROUP AND MANY OTHERS GOT FLINT'S KIDS PROTECTED
THESE UNHEALTHY CULTURES THAT ARE FESTERING IN THESE GROUPS WHERE THE FOCUS IS ON MEETING REGULATIONS
AMONGST THEM WAS ONE PITHY COUNSEL I WILL NEVER FORGET
FRESH OUT OF COLLEGE I WENT TO WORK FOR A CONSULTING FIRM
DURING ORIENTATION THE LEADERS DISHED OUT ADVICE
THEY RIDICULED RESIDENTS ASKING FOR HELP WHILE PUBLICLY INSISTING THAT THE BROWN SMELLY
YOU ALL HAVE HEARD THAT BEFORE
AND IN ORDER FOR US TO GET TO THAT POINT I THINK THERE'S A FEW THINGS THAT WE NEED TO BE DOING
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT COMING AND WATCHING PEOPLE ON A STAGE RIGHT
WE CAN HAVE DISAGREEMENTS WITHOUT BEING DISAGREEABLE BUT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US
BE A PART OF SOMETHING
WE HAVE TO ADDRESS PROBLEMS AT THE ROOT AND WHEN YOU DEAL WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING IN BLACK
AND THAT IS INTRICATELY RELATED TO BLACK LIVES
THE REALITY IS THAT BLACK WOMEN MAKE SOMETHING LIKE 64 CENTS TO EVERY 78 CENTS
AND THE WAY THAT WE TREAT CELEBRITIES IS VERY FICKLE RIGHT
I HAD TO GIVE THEM A LOT OF GRATITUDE AND PRAISE BECAUSE THEY SHOWED ME
AND WHEN I CAME BACK
WE LIKE THEM ONE DAY WE DON'T LIKE WHAT THEY'RE WEARING THE NEXT DAY AND ALL OF A SUDDEN WE HAVE ISSUES RIGHT
IT'S HAPPENING TO ME I KNOW THAT'S RIGHT
ONE CALL THE WHITE HOUSE
AND THERE'S A WAY IN WHICH WE'VE BEEN KIND OF TRANSFORMED INTO CELEBRITIES RATHER THAN
IT'S ABOUT HOW DO YOU BECOME THAT LEADER WHETHER IT'S IN YOUR WORKPLACE WHETHER IT'S IN YOUR HOME AND
THEY WERE ABLE TO LAUNCH NEW PROGRAMS FUNDRAISE
I'M INSPIRED BY SEEING OLDER PEOPLE STEP INTO THEIR OWN POWER AND LEADERSHIP AND SAY I'M
GET INVOLVED DON'T SIT ON YOUR COUCH AND TELL PEOPLE WHAT YOU THINK THEY SHOULD BE DOING
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE WAGE GAP WE OFTEN SAY WOMEN MAKE 78 CENTS TO EVERY
THEY WERE REELING FROM THE EARTHQUAKE THEY WERE REELING FROM CHOLERA THAT WAS BROUGHT IN BY UN PEACEKEEPERS
IT IS A TOOL TO REIMAGINE A WORLD WHERE BLACK PEOPLE ARE
AND THE CLOSER TO BLACK THAT YOU ARE ON THAT SPECTRUM THE WORSE OFF YOUR ARE
BUT I'M SO INSPIRED WHEN I SEE PEOPLE WHO HAVE A WAY THAT THEY DO THINGS HAVE A WAY THAT
IF WE WERE TO LOOK AT THE RAW DATA FROM THESE TELESCOPES
ALL I CAN SAY IS IT HAS JUST BEEN WONDERFUL
ONE OF THEM IS BIOMEDICAL AND ONE OF THEM IS ASTRONOMICAL AND YOU HAVE TO PICK THEM CORRECTLY IN
NOT REALLY GOOD AT THAT WHOLE GREEN YELLOW BLUE THING
SO HERE IS THE FIRST SET
SO WE'RE GOING TO PLAY A LITTLE GAME I LIKE TO CALL WHICH IS WHICH
I PLAY THIS WITH NEW DOCTORS AND ASTRONOMERS I WORK WITH
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU TWO IMAGES ON THE SCREEN
WHY DO I INSIST
FIRST I ASK IF YOU REALLY NEED THAT BECAUSE MANY NEEDS ARE CREATED
AND MY PERSONAL FAVORITE
I WAS REALLY UNFOCUSED AT WORK THINKING ABOUT WHAT I'M GOING TO DO ON MY LUNCH BREAK
THEY CHALLENGED ME WITH QUESTIONS TO TEST MY CAR KNOWLEDGE
I WANT WOMEN TO OWN THEIR CARS AND OWNING IT MEANS KNOWING IT
SO FOR EXAMPLE ONE TITLE IS
DOES YOUR CAR HAVE BOOGIES
SO THAT MEANS THERE ARE MORE WOMEN DRIVERS THAN MEN
OF COURSE MY LADIES CAME TO THE RESCUE BY SAYING
BUT IT REFLECTS ON HOW WE FEEL ABOUT THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY
I COULDN'T FIND A FEMALE MECHANIC SO I BECAME ONE
WITH CHILDREN'S HANDS IT'S REALLY REALLY HARD TO PLAY
WE START TO READ MUSIC
A FEW PEOPLE CARRY IT ON BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF US DON'T
WHY IS IT SO GOOD AT THIS
NOW I'VE BEEN SPEAKING FRENCH FOR 25 YEARS I'VE LIVED IN FRANCE AND MY FAMILY IS BILINGUAL ENGLISH FRENCH AND
I'M NO GOOD AT MUSIC
IT'S HAPPENING AS WE SPEAK WITH LESSONS DELIVERED BY ESPERANTO SPECIALISTS LIKE ME BUT ALSO
BY LEARNING THE RECORDER WE LEARN ABOUT MUSIC
OF COURSE THAT'S NOT THE POINT
ACTUALLY IT'S OBVIOUS
AND THEN IT'S DUDEK UNU DUDEK DU AND SO ON ALL THE WAY UP TO 99
YOU LEARN ABOUT RHYTHM AND TIME SIGNATURES KEEPING TIME WITH OTHERS AND HARMONIES
SO IS THIS SOME MASSIVE FAILURE OF PRIMARY SCHOOL POLICY
THAT'S NOT THE POINT
AND SO THE KIDS QUICKLY GET PAST THE STAGE WHERE THEY JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER STUFF AND CAN GET ONTO ACTUALLY USING
IT HELPS TO DEVELOP ALL THE MENTAL GYMNASTICS THAT'S INVOLVED IN HAVING TWO
SO BY TRANSLATING THE NUMBER INTO ESPERANTO IT CLARIFIES WHAT'S GOING ON WHAT THAT 2' IN 27' ACTUALLY MEANS
CIRCADIAN LIGHTING AT HOME FACTORIES OFFICES WILL PROMOTE ALERTNESS AND IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY
AND IN FACT RIGHT NOW THERE IS NEW CIRCADIAN LIGHTING IN OUR INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION TO
BUT THERE IS MORE TO IT
JUST THINK ABOUT IT
TO ADAPT TO THE 24 HOUR LIGHT DARK CYCLE OR DAY NIGHT CYCLE ON OUR PLANET ALMOST EVERY
OH I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR ANY OF THAT MY TEACHERS DID THOUGH
SO I WAS IN THE LIFT CHIT CHATTING TO THE MAYOR OF FRANKFURT PETRA ROTH AT THE TIME
YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO GET INTO MIT
THE LAST INGREDIENT THAT YOU NEED FOR DECIDING WHERE YOU ARE GOING TO GO WHEN HAVING THAT IMPACT ARE YOUR OWN VALUES
OK TOMORROW'S THE ENTRANCE EXAM WE'LL HAVE TO GO AND WE'LL SIGN UP ON THE DAY
THEY TOLD ME
SO EVEN THOUGH I DON'T HAVE TALENT YOU CAN GET PRETTY FAR
IT WASN'T A PARTICULARLY COOL THING TO DO
AT SCHOOL THEY OFFERED LATIN OR MATHS
DON'T BE DAUNTED BY THE FACT THAT I'VE TOLD YOU TO CHOOSE THE DIRECTION NOW IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE YOUR
BUT I'M ALSO TRYING TO SAVE MYSELF AND DO GOOD THINGS TO MYSELF
BUT I DID DECIDE THAT I WANT THE TOP MARK AT MY UPPER
BUT I WAS LIKE
WELL WHAT AM I GOING TO LOSE FROM FILLING OUT THIS APPLICATION
WE DECIDED FINE THAT'S ENOUGH
AND SO WHAT I'VE JUST TOLD YOU IS THAT YOU CAN CHOOSE ANY DIRECTION IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE YOUR OWN
SO ONE OF THE GOALS I TOLD YOU ABOUT WAS GOING TO A TOP UNIVERSITY
SO WHAT DID I DO
BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT SOCIETY DOESN'T WORK UNLESS EACH AND EVERYONE OF US ARE FEELING
IN THE BOOK MY NAME IS CELIA
SO MUCH SO THAT SHE WROTE TO DR GABOR MAT TO THANK HIM
HE IS MY DOCTOR
AS I DROVE HOME THAT NIGHT I CRIED
I CRIED BECAUSE I RECOGNIZED FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT HOMELESSNESS IS NOT JUST ABOUT A LACK OF HOUSING
DESPITE THE FACT THAT HE WAKES UP IN VANCOUVER'S ALLEYWAYS IT'S NOTHING COMPARED TO THE HELL HE ENDURED IN
PROBABLY MALE AGAIN
IT IS HAPPENING ACROSS ALL SOCIAL MEDIA
IT LOOKS LIKE THE KIND OF THING WE DO
WE HAVE TO PRETEND
JUST SPREAD THEM AROUND
BUT WE CAN'T FORCE THE MICROBES AND THEY GENERATE A SMALL AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY PER SECOND
THAT CHANGES THE WAY IN WHICH WE USE ROBOTS
AND YOU CAN MAKE ARTIFICIAL MUSCLES OUT OF JELLY
YOU CAN MAKE ROBOTS WHICH ARE BIODEGRADABLE
IT'S THE SAME PRINCIPLE
CAN YOU DO THIS
THIS IS SLIGHTLY NEWER
OUR CURRENT ROBOTS DON'T REALLY DO THAT
THIS IS ITS STOMACH
THAT'S FROM 40 50 YEARS AGO
AND IN A WONDERFUL ALCHEMY WHAT I'VE GIVEN AWAY HAS GIVEN ME STABILITY FROM WHICH I CAN VIEW
BUT I THINK THIS MAYBE BE ONE OF THE THINGS MACARTHUR MEANT WHEN HE SAID THAT
THE SECOND IS THAT LEADERS ARE EXPECTED TO FADE AWAY WHETHER OR NOT IT IS LABELED AS SUCH
EGO IS ONE OF THESE THINGS THAT'S A GOOD SERVANT AND A TERRIBLE MASTER
AND FOR ONE YEAR STILL EVERYDAY I GET MESSAGES FROM WOMEN WHO SAY EVERYDAY IN MY
THAT HAS TO GO INTO SCHOOLS
IT MAY EVEN SAVE YOU MONEY
IS MY SON SMART
THAT SENDS A VERY STRONG MESSAGE TO CHILDREN
YOU HAVE TO LAUGH RIGHT
AND THEY DO THE OUTSIDE THINGS LIKE BUILD CABINS ON SPECIAL DAYS
THIS IS WHAT WE RE TALKING ABOUT
BOTH MY GREAT GRANDMOTHER WHO HAD NO SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION TO HELP HER UNDERSTAND HER LIFE AND I WERE
SO WHEN FEMINISTS SAY AS THEY HAVE BEEN FOR CENTURIES ARE WOMEN HUMAN
THEY ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS
THEIR HEADS ARE SWIRLING IN CHAOS
BUT WE HAVE DIFFERENT EXPECTATIONS AND THOSE BIASES AFFECT THE WAY PARENTS AND TEACHERS INTERACT WITH BOYS AND
IT S MORE A MATTER OF HOW INTEGRATED THE TEACHING STAFF MAYBE
AND WHAT THEY RE SAYING TO GIRLS AND BOYS IS VERY DIFFERENT
WHERE ARE THEY
EVERYBODY SAYS THAT FEMINISTS DON T HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOR
WE NEED THEM TO BE INTERACTING WITH BOTH BOYS AND GIRLS WHETHER IT IS A SEX SEGREGATED SCHOOL OR NOT
DON T BITE YOUR TONGUE
AND ALL OF THAT IS TIED TO WHETHER WE CAN BE KNOWERS
AND THAT S IMPORTANT
AND SO THE FIRST THING I WOULD SAY IS
FATHERS SHOW UP
AND WHEN YOU TEACH MANNERS DON T HAVE THOSE MANNERS BE ABOUT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
THEY ARE SWIRLING IN CHAOS
IS MY SON A GENIUS
IS MY DAUGHTER PRETTY
WE NEED THEM TO BE SETTING EXAMPLES IN SCHOOLS
WE RE SUPPOSED TO BE QUIET
SO THE LAST THING I WOULD TELL YOU IS I AM HERE TELLING HER STORY WHICH IS A HUGE CHANGE IN THE LAST 50
WHAT WE ARE SAYING ABOUT KNOWLEDGE
HALF AN HOUR LATER SHE WASN'T BACK
SO I DIDN'T DO ANY OF THAT
AND YOU HAVE THAT POWER TOO
SO THE DYNAMIC THAT I AM TALKING ABOUT IT MAY BE THAT IN YOUR OWN HOME THERE S A CHORE GAP
AND NEXT TO THEM WAS AN EMPTY MEN'S ROOM
IT DOESN T ACQUIRE THAT YOU BUILD AN INSTITUTION AS WONDERFUL AS THE INSTITUTIONS ARE
AND WE HAVE AN INTERESTING LISTENER BIAS
SNOOP DOGGY DOGG COVERS THIS SONG ON HIS DEBUT ALBUM DOGGYSTYLE AND CALLS IT LODI DODI
THESE RECORDS DON'T REALLY AGE THAT WELL
AND THEN YOU FAST FORWARD TO 1997 AND THE NOTORIOUS B
HE LIVES ALL THE WAY IN L
THAT'S THE MAJOR THREAD
IT'S BEEN SAMPLED 547 TIMES
IN FOOD CHAINS THE LOVELIEST SPECIES ARE THE SINGLE CELLED PLANTS AND THEIR TINY PREDATORS
AND WHAT ARE THEY USING
SO WRITERS LIKE W
THE FIRST IS
NOW SHE'S HAPPY SHE'S EXCELLING AT HER SCHOOL WORK AND SHE'S SOCIALLY ACTIVE
WHEN PEOPLE COME AND TELL ME ABOUT THE PROPAGANDA THEY'VE HEARD ABOUT METHAMPHETAMINE PEOPLE WHO HAVE CLEARLY NEVER TRIED THE
ON THE OTHER HAND IT'S IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THAT IF 15 30 OF THE USERS OF PSYCHOACTIVE DRUGS
CULTURAL HISTORIAN NANCY CAMPBELL SAYS THAT WE TEND TO THINK OF THEM AS PROBLEM SOLVING DRUGS AND
OR ACROSS THE COUNTRY 51 MILLION PEOPLE
WHEN I TALK ABOUT DRUGS AND DESIRE PEOPLE MAKE TWO ASSUMPTIONS
THE AVERAGE WOMAN IN THIS COUNTRY IS FIVE FOUR AND WEIGHS 140 POUNDS
SO WHEN YOU'RE FEELING BADLY ABOUT YOURSELF BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT PERFECT GO FOR A WALK GO FOR A RUN GO FOR A SWIM GO FOR A WALK WITH A
BOTH PARENTS WERE VERY PHYSICALLY ATTRACTIVE
THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A PERFECT PERSON
IT'S LIKE YAHTZEE
THERE WAS A FAMILY IN OUR TOWN THAT I TRULY THOUGHT WAS THE PERFECT FAMILY
MOST OF MY PATIENTS LOOK AT FACEBOOK
ONE ARE PHYSICAL STRATEGIES
SO WE'RE NOT PERFECT
AND THE PROBLEM IS
I WASN'T DOING THE INTERVIEWING MY WRITER WAS AND SO I COULD KEEP CONFIDENTIALITY
AND ONE OF MY OTHER KIDS WAS JUST ARRESTED FOR SHOPLIFTING
THE AVERAGE MODEL IN THIS COUNTRY IS FIVE ELEVEN AND WEIGHS 117 POUNDS
AND SO IT'S LONELY IF YOU ARE A WORKING MOM
SO A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO I JOINED A BUNCO GROUP
SO AS MY BANK MANAGER LIKES TO REMIND ME I'M DOWNWARDLY MOBILE
THEY ARE EXAMPLES OF A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM
A CASTING TEAM IS THE UNSUNG HERO OF A LOT OF THEATRICAL PRODUCTIONS
I STOOD INSIDE FOR AN HOUR WHICH WAS AWESOME
BUT I KIND OF LOVED IT
I KNOW IT'S WEIRD
SO THEY'RE VERY PARTICULAR AND THEY'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR CERTAIN THINGS DEPENDING ON THE SHOW OR WHATEVER IT IS
AND THAT'S ANOTHER PART THAT YOU THAT DEAL WITH
MAYBE THEY'RE LOOKING TO SEE MORE PEOPLE WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE
BUT I SHOWED UP AND THERE JUST SEEMED TO BE A TREND
TAKE A LOOK
HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE EVER AUDITIONED FOR SOMETHING
OH YOU KNOW I JUST SAID IT
THEY PUT THE CAST TOGETHER AND THE UNITS THAT YOU SEE WHICH CHANGE YOU AFTER THE TWO AND A HALF HOURS
AND SO I COULDN'T WAIT
I STOOD OUTSIDE FOR AN HOUR WHICH WAS AWESOME
I DON'T KNOW
I WENT INTO MIDTOWN MANHATTAN
I WAS REVVING AND READY TO GO
AND THIS IS MY FAVORITE PART
HOW CAN THEY REMEMBER ME IN ANY WAY
WE WILL HAVE EXPERIENCED SOMETHING TOGETHER AND WE'LL NEVER BE THE SAME
WE WERE ALL WAITING IN LINE ME AND BUNCH OF OTHER GUYS
SO I GO ONTO MY LAST AUDITION OF THE DAY
I EAT MY DINNER AND I WAIT
NOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS NEVER HAPPENED TO ME BEFORE THIS POINT OR AFTER
AND THEN I WAITED
I BRUSHED MY TEETH I TOOK A SHOWER
I HOPPED ON A SUBWAY IN ASTORIA
TO THE TABLE IS GOOD ENOUGH OR NOT
SO THE CASTING TEAM DEFINITELY HAD TO KNOCK DOWN THE MUSIC ON THIS ONE
AND WE WERE JUST WAITING
BUT IN NEW YORK CITY AUDITIONING IS A LIFESTYLE AUDITIONING IS A FULL TIME JOB
NOW AS MENTIONED I DID ATTEND PENN STATE
SO THAT'S WHAT I DID
SO I TRIED TO THINK HOW CAN I TELL THESE PEOPLE WHO I AM
IT WAS THE WEIRDEST EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER HAD IN AN AUDITION
AND THE THING ABOUT IT IS I WAS PURSUING A DREAM
I WAS BORN WITH IT
I DON'T KNOW WHY THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE
I'M MADELEINE MACEDA HEIDE I'M THE ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT FOR THE AMERICAN SCHOOL OF BOMBAY
AND I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THERE ARE A LOT OF THOSE PRODUCTS RIGHT HERE AS WELL
BUT THERE ARE ALSO OTHER THINGS THAT CAN CAUSE A DISTRACTION THAT CAN CAUSE US TO LOOK LIKE WE'RE NOT PAYING
I KNOW MY PARENTS DID
NOW DON'T GET ME WRONG
AND THEN YOU TURN TOWARD THAT NOISE TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THE CAUSE OF IS GOING TO BE A PROBLEM
REMEMBER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DEVELOPING BRAINS HERE
SO WHAT HAPPENS IS WHEN YOU GET TOO MUCH CAFFEINE IN YOUR BODY IF YOU'VE EVER HAD TOO MUCH
WELL WHY IS THIS
CHILDREN CAN BE UNDER ALL KINDS OF STRESS
WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY IS THEY DON'T HAVE THAT CONVERSATION VERY OFTEN
SO MY WHOLE PURPOSE HERE TODAY IS TO SAY
WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS THE EFFECT IT HAS ON THE GROWING BRAIN
NOW THIS INFORMATION COMES FROM THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL IN THE UNITED STATES
5 MILLION CHILDREN
SO THAT'S ANOTHER ONE TO WATCH FOR
AND I WORRY THAT WE DON'T GIVE ENOUGH ATTENTION TO THAT
FOR PARENTS AND EDUCATORS ADHD POSES COMPLEX QUESTIONS OF HOW BEST TO SERVE
I'M DELIGHTED TO PRESENT SUCH A KNOWLEDGEABLE INCREDIBLE EDUCATOR TO ENLIGHTEN US ABOUT THIS IMPORTANT
PLEASE WELCOME DR
SO THEY'RE SPENDING THAT MUCH MORE TIME CONNECTED TO THEIR OUTSIDE WORLD THAN TO THEIR INSIDE WORLD WHERE THEY SHOULD
SHE SAID I HAVE TO GO
WHEN WE GIVE OURSELVES THE CHOICE BETWEEN YES OR NO
MARYANNE IN HER WISE WAY SAT DOWN AND RUBBED HER DAUGHTER'S BACK AND SHE SAID IT'S OKAY HONEY YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO
AND EITHER CHOICE WOULD HAVE BEEN FINE FOR ARIANA SHE COULD HAVE GONE OR NOT
ARE YOU READY TO LEAVE THE STRAIGHT PATH BEHIND
ONE QUESTION FOR YOU
I'M ALSO INSPIRED BY MY COMMITMENT TO HELP WOMEN THRIVE NOT JUST FOR THEMSELVES BUT IN
IT ISN'T ABOUT DESTINATION IT'S ABOUT NAVIGATING LIFE'S WAVES SO THAT
ARIANA THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND BOLTED UPRIGHT IN BED
EVERY MUSCLE SEARED IN MY BODY
AND IF YOU KEEP DOING IT ONCE YOU'VE HIT THAT POINT IT CAN REALLY KEEP YOU STUCK DOING THINGS THAT ARE
IT WAS THE DAY OF HER EIGHT YEAR OLD DAUGHTER'S RECITAL AND SHE FOUND ARIANA SOBBING HYSTERICALLY ON THE BED
A GOOD FAIRY TURNED HIM INTO A REAL BOY
IT'S NOT JUST REPULSION
SO I EMAILED HER AND SHE SAID I'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU COME ON UP
IT IS WORK AND IT'S WORK I LOVE
I'D HATCHED A PLAN
SHE AND JOHN RYDER HER HUSBAND ARE ACTUALLY THE ONLY TWO RYDERS THAT LIVE ON THE PROPERTY
HERE'S WHAT DIDN'T HAPPEN
AND IN CASE THERE IS ANY SORT OF QUESTION I'M VERY WELL AWARE THAT NOT EVERYONE HAS A LONG
WORD GOT OUT ABOUT SPACE
AND I DIDN'T MISS IT
FOR ME THERE WASN'T A LIGHTBULB MOMENT
THEY RUN THE ORGANIC FARMING OPERATION
ON MARCH 17 2009 I WROTE AN EMAIL TO A FOURTH COUSIN ONCE REMOVED I
AND KEEP US LIVING LIVES THAT ARE SAFE AND TIDY
I HAVE AN AGENT SO IT'S OBVIOUSLY GOING REALLY REALLY WELL FOR ME
AND WE ALMOST NEVER SAW A REEF HIT ZERO
WELL NOT QUITE
IN THE SPRING IT CAN BE A CACOPHONY OF SOUND
WHAT DO I MEAN BY SOUNDSCAPE
THANKS VERY MUCH FOR LISTENING
THEY NEED TO CARRY OUT IMPACT ASSESSMENT TO IDENTIFY AND FIX THE PROBLEMS
THIS IS SLIGHTLY NEWER
JUST SPREAD THEM AROUND
IF YOU CHOOSE THE RIGHT MICROBES THE MICROBES WILL EAT THE ALGAE
THIS IS ITS STOMACH
NOT ONLY THAT BUT IF YOU SELECT THE RIGHT KIND OF MICROBES YOU CAN USE THE MICROBIAL FUEL CELL TO
WELL THIS IS REALLY REALLY EXCITING
SO WOULDN'T IT BE NICE IF THESE ROBOTS INSTEAD OF BEING LIKE THIS MADE OUT OF PLASTIC WERE MADE OUT OF OTHER MATERIALS WHICH
WE COULD SEND A MESSAGE SAYING THIS IS HOW MUCH POLLUTION I'VE EATEN RECENTLY OR THIS IS THE KIND OF STUFF THAT I'VE ENCOUNTERED
IT'S GOING TO TOTALLY CHANGE THE WAY IN WHICH WE THINK ABOUT ROBOTS BUT ALSO IT ALLOWS YOU TO BE REALLY CREATIVE IN THE WAY
WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING IS YOU CAN USE HOUSEHOLD MATERIALS TO MAKE THESE BIODEGRADABLE ROBOTS
BUT WE CAN'T FORCE THE MICROBES AND THEY GENERATE A SMALL AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY PER SECOND
HOW CAN WE COPE WITH THAT
SO WHAT IS IT
SO THAT'S WHAT WE DO
IN FACT BECAUSE WE'RE USING THE WATER BOATMAN AS INSPIRATION AND OUR ROBOT SITS ON TOP OF THE WATER
WHO CAN TAKE 18 MONTHS
BUT THIS IS SOMETHING EVERY ONE OF US CAN DO NOW
WE WEREN'T IN TOTAL SILENCE FOR 18 MONTHS
I'M A LONG WAY FROM THAT MOUNTAIN RETREAT NOW
FAR FROM IT
OR TO TAKE IT TO ANOTHER LEVEL
MAYBE THEY'D DONE SOMETHING THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR US
BUT OVER TIME WE SAW FRIENDS TRANSFORMED BY THE PRACTICE WE READ COMMENTARY FROM ACROSS THE AGES A LOT OF IT
IT COSTS OVER 800 DOLLARS AND IT IS NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE PLAN
THE PROBLEM IS THAT YOUR BLOOD IT IS ALREADY ABUNDANT IN PROTEINS
IN ADDITION IT IS RARELY ORDERED BECAUSE PANCREATIC CANCER IS WHAT WE CALL NON SYMPTOMATIC DISEASE
AND I GOT 199 REJECTIONS OUT OF THOSE 200 AND 1 LUKEWARM MAYBE
THE AVERAGE SURVIVAL TIME IS ABOUT 3 MONTHS
SO IT'S NOT AN OPTION TO LOWER INCOME PATIENTS
SO FIND THIS TINY INCREASE IN THIS TINY AMOUNT OF PROTEIN IN THERE IS NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE
AND THAT SOUNDS VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD BUT IT'S ANYTHING BUT
WHAT I FOUND IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THIS TINY BIOMARKER OF PROTEIN THAT IS FOUND IN YOUR BLOOD
THEN WHAT I REALIZED IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO DO IS KIND OF LIKE FIND A NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK
I FINALLY FOUND THIS ONE PROTEIN AND I WAS NEXT TO INSANITY THERE
SHE IS LIKE WHAT ARE YOU DOING YOUNG MAN
YOU HAVE LITERS AND LITERS OF IT IN YOUR BODY
IT DOESN'T SHOW ANY SYMPTOMS
USUALLY THEY ARE JUST LIKE REALLY RANDOM SYMPTOMS LIKE ABDOMINAL PAIN
SHE STORMS UP RED IN THE FACE
I HAVE REALIZED MY PROCEDURE WASN'T AS PERFECT AS I HAD INITIALLY THOUGHT
IT MISSES OVER 30 PERCENT OF ALL PANCREATIC CANCERS
AND 3 MONTH LATER I LANDED DOWN A DATE WITH HIM
I GO IN ON WITH THE 500 PLUS JOURNAL ARTICLES I HAVE READ
WHAT I FOUND ON THE INTERNET WAS EYE BOGGLING
SO IF YOU COULD DETECT THIS YOU WOULD BARELY HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE CANCER THEN
WHY THE BUS CAN'T ADAPT TO WHAT YOU NEED
AGAIN WE CAN'T MOVE
I WANT TO SHOW YOU WHAT THE FUTURE OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION LOOKS LIKE
IT TAKES DOZENS OF YEARS IF AT ALL UNTIL THE NEW SUBWAY LINE GETS THERE
EVEN THE ONGOING OPERATING EXPENSES OF MOST OF THE WORLD'S PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION
GRAPHENE WILL CHANGE THE WORLD
I BELIEVE IT'S POSSIBLE
REMAKING IT WOULD MEAN TWO THINGS
I DREAM OF IT
NOW OF COURSE THERE'S OTHER WAYS TO DEAL WITH THAT
AND SO THAT SPIRIT LIVES ON
IT TAKES A SHORT TIME TO RUIN LOVE
WHEN I WOULD SEE HER AS A LITTLE BOY SHE'D COME UP TO ME AND SHE'D GIVE ME THESE HUGS
HE KEPT PACING BACK AND FORTH
YOU ALL GO AHEAD
IT WAS FASCINATING BECAUSE ONE OF THE SCHOLARS STOOD UP AFTER THE PRESENTATION AND SAID WELL YOU KNOW IT'S DEEPLY
I SAID YES SIR
BUT SOMEHOW WE CAN INSULATE OURSELVES FROM THIS PROBLEM
SHE SAID NOW YOU MAKE SURE YOU DON'T DO THAT
THAT OUR VISIONS OF TECHNOLOGY AND DESIGN AND ENTERTAINMENT AND CREATIVITY HAVE TO BE MARRIED WITH VISIONS
WE LOVE CREATIVITY
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO SOMEONE WHO BELIEVED THAT
AND BECAUSE I WAS UP TOO LATE WASN'T THINKING REAL STRAIGHT I STARTED WORKING ON A MOTION
I HAD SOME YOUR SISTER HAD SOME
AND HE KEPT LOOKING THROUGH THE WINDOW AND HE COULD HEAR ALL OF THIS HOLLER
IT WOULD BE SO ENERGIZING AND SO EMPOWERING
IT WILL GET TO YOU
THIS COUNTRY IS VERY DIFFERENT TODAY THAN IT WAS 40 YEARS AGO
IT WAS THIS MISGUIDED WAR ON DRUGS
THERE WAS A CRAZY LINE IN THERE ABOUT HOW THERE'S NO CONDUCT IN THIS COUNTY IT'S ALL MISCONDUCT
I ACTUALLY LEARNED ABOUT THIS FROM MY GRANDMOTHER
AND AS SOON AS I WALKED INSIDE THE JUDGE SAW ME COMING IN
HAVE SOME BEER
MY COUSINS WOULD BE RUNNING AROUND EVERYWHERE
MY BROTHER SAID COME ON
I'LL DO THAT
WE LOVE INNOVATION
WELL I ADORED MY MOM SO I SAID YES MAMA
I HAD WRITTEN THESE CRAZY THINGS
AND YET 46 PERCENT OF ALL HOMICIDE CASES DON'T RESULT IN ARREST
AND THIS MAN CAME OVER TO ME AND HE HUGGED ME
WE'RE TRYING TO CONFRONT BIAS AND DISCRIMINATION IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE
WE'RE DOING THIS TODAY YOU ALWAYS DO WHAT WE DO
AND OF COURSE WE CAN NEVER HAVE THE DEATH PENALTY IN GERMANY
PARKS IS COMING TO TOWN
HE SAID WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU
I HAD THE GREAT PRIVILEGE WHEN I WAS A YOUNG LAWYER OF MEETING ROSA PARKS
AND THAT'S A VERY SENSIBLE QUESTION
VACLAV HAVEL THE GREAT CZECH LEADER TALKED ABOUT THIS
AND OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE I COULD SEE THIS JANITOR PACING BACK AND FORTH
HE SAID JIMMY WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THIS COURTROOM
WE'RE CONSTANTLY RUNNING INTO EACH OTHER
I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE ANY BEER
I SAID I'M A LAWYER
WE'RE GOING TO GET TOGETHER AND TALK
I SAID SURE
THE GREAT INCREASE IN MASS INCARCERATION IN THIS COUNTRY WASN'T REALLY IN VIOLENT CRIME CATEGORIES
I SAID OKAY MAMA
YOU SHOULD ASK FOR SOME OF THAT
HE SAID WE DON'T HAVE THE DEATH PENALTY IN GERMANY
AND THEN MY BROTHER STARTED STARING AT ME
WE NEED TO FIND WAYS TO EMBRACE THESE CHALLENGES THESE PROBLEMS THE SUFFERING
HE SAID YOU'RE A LAWYER
AND THESE WOMEN WOULD GET TOGETHER AND JUST TALK
AND MY GRANDMOTHER WAS TOUGH BUT SHE WAS ALSO LOVING
AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU IT WAS ENERGIZING
IN 1972 THERE WERE 300000 PEOPLE IN JAILS AND PRISONS
TODAY THERE ARE 2
I SAID YES SIR
AND EVERY NOW AND THEN MS
AND I'D SAY YES MA'AM I DO
WE'RE CONSTANTLY CREATING TENSIONS AND CONFLICTS
WE'RE ACTUALLY PROJECTING IN ANOTHER 10 YEARS THE LEVEL OF DISENFRANCHISEMENT WILL BE AS HIGH AS IT'S BEEN SINCE PRIOR TO THE
WE DON'T REALLY KNOW VERY MUCH ABOUT IT
SO THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE THAT
FOR EVERY NINE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN EXECUTED WE'VE ACTUALLY IDENTIFIED ONE INNOCENT PERSON WHO'S BEEN EXONERATED AND
Y'ALL GO AHEAD
BUT BROADBAND PENETRATION WAS TOO LOW IN 1999 2000
THE CUSTOMER IS THE TRUE REALITY
WE STARTED A COMPANY CALLED Z
COM IT WAS AN ONLINE ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY
IT APPEARED AS THOUGH THE WORLD WAS OUT TO GET ME
SEEMS LIKE EVERYONE HAD AN OPINION THOUGH SO I SPENT MOST OF MY TIME LOCKED DOWN IN SEGREGATION
I HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT THIS AMONG MANY OTHER PROGRAMS REALLY HELPED ME TO TURN MY LIFE AROUND
VIOLENCE IS NEVER THE ANSWER
TROUBLE KNEW MY NAME AND WHERE TO FIND ME
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS PERSON BEFORE
REALLY IT WAS ME AGAINST THE WORLD
I EXPECTED THE WEEKEND TO END IN DISASTER AND I AVERTED MY EYES A LOT BECAUSE I WAS CERTAIN THAT IF I
WHAT YOU TRIPPIN' FOR
I WOULD NEVER BE ACCEPTED INTO ANY COMMUNITY
AND THE PEOPLE WHO WERE SUPPOSED TO BE HELPING ME WERE CONDEMNING ME TO HELL EVEN THOUGH THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HAD HAPPENED
MY CHILDREN WERE MY ONLY JOY AND I DIDN'T HAVE THAT ANYMORE
SO I REVERTED TO MY OLD WAYS TO KEEP FROM LOSING MYSELF AS I FELL DEEPER INTO THE PIT
MY FACE BECAME UNRECOGNIZABLE AND LOOKED LIKE ROTTEN MASHED POTATOES
IT HELD 20 INMATES TWO INMATE FACILITATORS AND THREE VOLUNTEERS PACKED INTO A LITTLE 9
PEACE TALKS ACCEPTED OUR POSITION AS INMATES AND ACKNOWLEDGED THE HURT FROM OUR PAST
NOW IS THE TIME THAT WE NEED YOU THE MOST
BUT I WAS ALONE AND I WAS DROWNING
TO MAKE IT WORSE NOBODY WAS LISTENING NOBODY CARED
IRONICALLY WHEN I LOST THE WILL TO FIGHT IS WHEN MY WHOLE WORLD COLLAPSED
BUT I WONDER
IN 2010 THIS WOMEN'S PRISON RATED AS HAVING THE MOST VIOLENT INFRACTIONS
PEOPLE WHO FIGHT WHOSE PRIMARY LANGUAGE IS PROFANITY
I'VE NEVER WANTED TO HURT ANYONE
I ALSO GREW UP A POOR KID
THIRD GRADERS WERE BULLYING MY SISTER SO I STOOD UP FOR HER
BEHIND OUR TOUGH MASKS WE'RE FIGHTING FOR OUR LIVES AND YOU WON'T REACH US IF YOU DON'T PROVE
I WAS ALWAYS THE NEW KID THAT EVERYBODY MADE FUN OF
TO JUDGE SOMEONE BEFORE ONE KNOWS THEM MAKES THE OTHER PERSON FEEL INFERIOR UNWORTHY OF
UNFORTUNATELY SO ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE
BUT MINE REALLY ARE
I THINK WE AS GLORIA LADSON BILLINGS SAYS SHOULD FLIP OUR PARADIGM AND OUR
I COULD CREATE ALL THE ELECTRICITY I NEEDED WITH VERY LITTLE MONEY BECAUSE I NEEDED LESS
I STARTED TO RIDE A BICYCLE MORE AND DRIVE THE CAR LESS
I CHANGED THE FOOD I WAS PUTTING INTO MY BODY NO MORE OF THAT PACKAGED PROCESSED JUNK INSTEAD WHOLE FOODS
BUT WHAT I LEARNED IS THAT SUSTAINABLE LIVING IS A SPECTRUM
I'D LIKE YOU TO HOLD IN YOUR MIND IF YOU WOULD FOR JUST A MOMENT A MENTAL IMAGE OF AN AVERAGE BIT OF THE OCEAN AND WHAT
IT'S REALLY JUST A MATTER OF IMPLEMENTATION
BUT IT DOESN'T STOP THERE
WE WILL FIND WAYS TO FEED A GROWING POPULATION THROUGH FISHERIES MANAGEMENTS AND CREATIVE AQUACULTURE
CHRONIC PROBLEMS LIKE PLASTIC POLLUTION ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF ALL OF THE THINGS THE OCEAN DOES FOR US
HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE
BRING A CLOTH BAG TO THE SUPERMARKET
THERE ARE FANTASTIC CHANCES WAITING OUT THERE FOR US TO EXPLORE AND DISCOVER INVENT THINGS SOLVE
WE SHOULDN'T SHY AWAY FROM THE CHALLENGES OF WORKING IN THE DEEP OCEAN
SAY NO TO THE STRAW
BUT THE OCEAN IS ALSO A CHALLENGING PLACE TO WORK
ACTIVATION ENERGY IF YOU LIKE
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DEEPEST PART OF THE OCEAN THAT IS THE MARIANA'S TRENCH OFF THE COAST OF GUAM THE PRESSURE IS MORE THAN
ONCE IN 1961 AND ONCE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO
IN ORDER TO NAVIGATE THE CHALLENGES OF THE COMING CENTURY
I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER WHAT IMPACT ALL THOSE LITTLE BITS OF PLASTIC HAVE ON THE WHALES HARKS THAT I STUDY
THEY MAKE A LIVING BY SEPARATING PLANKTON FROM HUGE VOLUMES OF WATER AND I'M ALL BUT CERTAIN THAT THEY INGEST THIS
BUT WE HAVE TO GET CRACKING
I REALLY WANTED TO BE FREED FROM RELYING ON SOMEONE
I DESPERATELY WANTED TO HELP THE BLIND PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET
IT DOESN'T KILL THE ROACH NOR DOES IT SEDATE IT
THIS CATERPILLAR WAS ATTACKED BY A PARASITIC WASP WHICH LAID EGGS INSIDE IT
JUST LIKE THE CRICKET WAS AN EXTENSION OF THE GORDIAN WORM
TOXO GETS TO HAVE SEX
HOW DOES THE PARASITE CONTROL ITS HOST IN THIS WAY
THEY'RE EASY TO OVERLOOK BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY AREN'T IMPORTANT
IT'S ACTUALLY THE EXACT OPPOSITE
AND I'VE BEEN WRITING ABOUT THESE CREATURES EVER SINCE
FEW TOPICS IN BIOLOGY ENTHRALL ME MORE
MOST PEOPLE THINK IT IS MAJORITY OF RULE
IF THIS WERE ADOPTED AS THE INTERNATIONAL DEMOCRATIC NORM THERE WOULD BE NO FURTHER
IT MOVES THROUGH THE PLANT SO THAT A CROP PEST A LEAF EATING INSECT WOULD TAKE A BITE OF THE PLANT AND
BEES GET ALL OF THE PROTEIN THEY NEED IN THEIR DIET FROM POLLEN AND ALL OF THE CARBOHYDRATES THEY NEED
WE NEED A BEAUTIFUL DIVERSITY OF FLOWERS THAT BLOOMS OVER THE ENTIRE GROWING SEASON FROM SPRING TO
HOW MUCH IS IT GOING TO TAKE TO CONTAMINATE HUMANS
I WAS 18 YEARS OLD AND BORED AND I PICKED UP A BOOK IN THE LIBRARY ON BEES AND I SPENT THE
SO BEES HAVE SOCIAL HEALTHCARE
IT'S A NATURAL ANTIBIOTIC
BUT YOU MAY ASK
WE COULD EVEN SAY THAT IT IS A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT WHICH IS AT THE ORIGIN OF MODERN SCIENCE IN THE
IS THIS STILL THE CASE
AND CAN THIS GENERATION OF PEOPLE REDEFINE THE PUBLIC'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ART
GRADUALLY PEOPLE HAVE BEGUN TO PICK UP THE FRAGMENTS BENDING AND TWISTING IN THEIR OWN UNIQUE
IT WAS STUNNING AND NO ONE HAS DONE IT SINCE
WE WERE ALWAYS MISSING SOME
AND THAT'S JUST NOT GOING TO GET YOU THERE
THIS COULD BE A PROBLEM
SO I WANT TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO GET AROUND THAT
IT WAS NOT WITHOUT RISK THOUGH
YOU JUST COULDN'T DO IT
BUT IT JUST REALLY GOES TO SHOW THAT SOMETIMES THE BEST SOLUTIONS ARE THE SIMPLEST SOLUTIONS
AND SO THE QUESTION I ASK ALL OF YOU TODAY IS WHY WAIT
IT'S ALSO AN EXCUSE GENERATOR
SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU MAY SMOKE BECAUSE AS A CHILD YOU SAW SOMEONE SMOKING SURROUNDED BY MANY
THE SURGERY WAS SUCCESSFUL
SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADO A HUGE WELCOME TO GRETCHEN AND DAVID
THEY SEE A MAN OF ACTION
AND LISTEN I'VE WRITTEN EIGHT MILLION ANTI TRUMP COLUMNS BUT IT IS A PROBLEM ESPECIALLY FOR THE COASTAL MEDIA THAT EVERY
SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO FIGHT
I HAVE TO THROW IN THERE ALSO CELEBRITY
THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT AMERICA
I MAY GET THIS A LITTLE WRONG BUT I THINK OF THE TOP SELLING AUTOMOTIVE MODELS IN THIS COUNTRY I THINK THE TOP
I SORT OF HAVE MORE RESPECT FOR HIM
I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO WORK
IF YOU GET YOUR FEELINGS HURT WELL WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF EDUCATION
AND THAT IS NOT TRADITIONALLY THE AMERICAN IDENTITY
THEY'VE IMMERSED THEMSELVES IN CONSERVATIVE WORLDVIEWS IF YOU LIKE
THE PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT HIM ON EVIDENCE SO FAR ARE PROBABLY PRETTY EXCITED
IT DIDN'T JUST HAPPEN OVERNIGHT
THERE ARE THE FOREIGN POLICIES HAWKS WHO BELIEVE IN AMERICA AS GLOBAL POLICEMAN
ACTUALLY MAYBE THEY'RE SUPPORTING HIM DESPITE THOSE BECAUSE THEY SEE SOMETHING EXCITING
READ A COLUMN THAT IS NOT SOMETHING YOU WOULD NORMALLY READ BECAUSE THEN YOU GAIN PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT THE OTHER SIDE
AND I WOULD SAY NO IT'S NOT
I THINK WE HAVE TO HAVE A DYNAMIC ECONOMY THAT CREATES GROWTH
AND THERE'S A WHOLE WORLDVIEW THERE IT'S A VERY COHERENT WORLDVIEW
I LOATHE WHAT HE STANDS FOR AND I THINK HE'S WRONG ON THE SUBSTANCE BUT IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE SOMEONE WITH A SET OF
IF I'M GOING TO WATCH A SITCOM OR A LATE NIGHT COMEDY SHOW IT'S GOING TO BE LIBERAL
AND AS A SOCIETY WE DO NOT HAVE A SECURE BASE AND WE WON'T GET TO THAT HAMILTON RISK TAKING ENERGETIC
DEREGULATION THAT'S RISK
I WAS TOLD THAT EVERY SINGLE DAY
THAT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE TOO PERSUASIVE TO YOU
AND THAT'S SORT OF A WARNING SIGN KIND OF A PROBLEM
ONE THE PHRASE FLYOVER COUNTRY
ON THE OTHER SIDE ARE THOSE WHO FEEL THE HEADWINDS OF GLOBALIZATION AND THE MERITOCRACY JUST BLASTING IN THEIR FACES
I HAVE NO IDEA
THAT PHRASE RUNG IN MY HEAD WORD PEOPLE
AND SO THAT ACCUMULATION OF THINGS AND WHEN I TALKED TO TRUMP VOTERS AND STILL DO I FOUND MOST OF THEM COMPLETELY REALISTIC
THE TRUTH IS THAT 87 PERCENT OF THE JOBS WERE REPLACED BY TECHNOLOGY
BUT THEN IF YOU ACTUALLY LOOK AT A LOT OF HIS ECONOMIC POLICIES LIKE HEALTH CARE REFORM WHICH IS ABOUT PRIVATE HEALTH CARE
IT'S JUST THAT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT
AND SO IF I'M GOING TO TELL PEOPLE THAT THEY SHOULD TAKE RISKS ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE SEEING IS A
THEY KNOW THAT SPACE VERY WELL
AND I HAVE TWO PEOPLE WITH US TO HELP US DO THAT
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO COME AT THIS HAMMER AND TONG AGAINST EACH OTHER
SO HOW DO WE GIVE PEOPLE THE SECURITY FROM WHICH THEY CAN TAKE RISK
THEY'RE NOT GOOD FOR TODAY
AND THAT'S BEEN HEARD FOR YEARS BUT I WOULD SAY THIS YEAR I HEARD IT ALMOST ON AN HOURLY BASIS A SENSE OF
THIS IS NOT LIKE CABLE NEWS
IT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE I WAS LOOKING IN THE AUDIENCE TRYING TO SEE DEMOCRATIC WOMEN WHO DIDN'T WEAR WHITE
IS HE GOING TO DO THAT
ARE THESE TWO THINGS IMPLACABLY OPPOSED TO EACH OTHER
NOW THERE'S OFTEN NO RIGHT OR WRONG HERE
A LOT OF GOOD EXPERIMENTS IN THIS
COMPARE THAT TO THE SECONDHAND SMOKE DEBATE PROBABLY ABOUT 20 YEARS BEHIND
MODELS CAN COME FROM INDUSTRY
A LOT OF TIMES THESE TRADE OFFS ARE ABOUT MORE THAN JUST SECURITY AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
THOSE TAMPER PROOF CAPS
STRONG FEELINGS CAN CREATE A MODEL
I'LL GIVE YOU ONE A SYRINGE
AND THERE'S SOME BASIC INNUMERACY GOING ON
IT'S A HORRIFIC STORY
WE RELY ON PROXIES
THERE AREN'T ENOUGH EXAMPLES OF FAILURES
BUT IT MADE PEOPLE FEEL BETTER
THE QUESTION IS WAS IT WORTH IT
AND IT'LL DEPEND ON WHERE WE LIVE WHETHER WE LIVE ALONE OR HAVE A FAMILY HOW MUCH COOL STUFF WE HAVE
I TELL PEOPLE IF IT'S IN THE NEWS DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT BECAUSE BY DEFINITION NEWS IS SOMETHING THAT ALMOST
I'LL GIVE YOU THE SHORT ANSWER
SO EVIDENCE AGAINST OUR MODEL WE'RE LIKELY TO IGNORE EVEN IF IT'S COMPELLING
WE'RE TERRIBLE AT MODELS THAT SPAN 80 YEARS
AND LANGUAGE IS ACTUALLY A PROBLEM HERE
I MEAN THE JOKE ONE TWO THREE MANY IS KIND OF RIGHT
MODELS ARE HARD TO DISLODGE
IT ACTUALLY DOES
ONE YOU CAN MAKE PEOPLE ACTUALLY SECURE AND HOPE THEY NOTICE
IT HAS TO GET VERY COMPELLING BEFORE WE'LL PAY ATTENTION
IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE RISKS YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE COSTS YOU'RE LIKELY TO GET THE TRADE OFF WRONG AND YOUR
AND WE RELY ON OTHERS
REALLY WE HAVE TWO SEPARATE CONCEPTS MAPPED ONTO THE SAME WORD
I VISIT HER IN THE HOSPITAL
WE DON'T KNOW
NOW PEOPLE HAVE A NATURAL INTUITION ABOUT THESE TRADE OFFS
WE MAKE THEM EVERY DAY
THAT CAME FROM THIS
ALL EXAMPLES OF MODELS CHANGING
AND THERE ARE TWO WAYS TO DO THIS
THIS MODEL IS AN INTELLIGENT REPRESENTATION OF REALITY
I GO HOME I LOOK IT UP
IT'S A MODEL WE JUST ACCEPT PRETTY MUCH BY FAITH
THAT'S HOW YOU THINK ABOUT SECURITY IN TERMS OF THE TRADE OFF
WHETHER THIS IS A PERSONAL DECISION WHETHER YOU'RE GOING TO INSTALL A BURGLAR ALARM IN YOUR HOME OR A NATIONAL DECISION WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO INVADE
YOU'VE HEARD IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS THE WORLD IS SAFER BECAUSE SADDAM HUSSEIN IS NOT IN POWER
IT BASICALLY NEVER HAPPENS
AND THAT'S OK
1982 I DON'T KNOW IF PEOPLE WILL REMEMBER THIS THERE WAS A SHORT EPIDEMIC OF TYLENOL POISONINGS IN THE
AND I CALL THAT THEIR AGENDA
THAT MIGHT BE TRUE BUT IT'S NOT TERRIBLY RELEVANT
THINK OF CANCER BIRD FLU SWINE FLU SARS
WE LIVE IN A TECHNOLOGICAL WORLD REALITY CHANGES ALL THE TIME
ONE MANGO TWO MANGOES THREE MANGOES 10000 MANGOES 100000 MANGOES IT'S STILL MORE MANGOES YOU CAN EAT
AND THAT DESIGN COULD BE FDA PROVED AND REGULATED
IT'S KIND OF AN ANTIBIOTIC
IT MAKES THE LOGICAL SENSE TO GO AFTER CANCER ONE PERSON AT A TIME BECAUSE NO TWO CANCERS ARE THE SAME
IT'S HARMLESS TO HUMANS
IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER
GIVE ME AN INHALER TOO
THIS CHANGES THE BUSINESS MODEL OF BIOTECH
NOW IT'S NOT A CANCER FIGHTING VIRUS IN ANY WAY IT'S COMPLETELY HARMLESS BUT THIS IS A SOFTWARE COMPANY
THAT'S SUPER COOL
IT'S YOUR ROGUE CELLS NOT SOMEONE ELSE'S
TODAY WE DON'T EVEN GET A DAY OFF OF WORK IF WE GET AN INFECTION
I'M KIND OF AN OPPOSITIONAL KIND A GUY I SEE PEOPLE RUNNING THIS WAY I'M GOING TO GO AND TAKE A LOOK
AND I FIGURED
IT'S WHAT WAKES ME UP TO LIFE
YOU FIGURE IT OUT
PRIVACY WAS THE CENTRAL CHALLENGE IN A SMALL DATA ERA
IN THIS RESPECT LOCATION HAS BEEN DATAFIED
THREE OF THE TRAITS WERE ONES THAT PEOPLE DIDN'T NEED TO LOOK FOR BUT THAT THE MACHINE
IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE THE CHALLENGE THAT WAS FACED BY PRIMITIVE MAN AND FIRE
AND THAT PERSON'S JOB AS WELL AS AN ENTIRE FLEET OF PROFESSIONALS LIKE THAT PERSON IS GOING TO FIND THAT THEIR
HE OR SHE VOTES
HE OR SHE IS A STAKEHOLDER IN SOCIETY
IT INCREASES THE ACCURACY OF ITS PREDICTION
SO WHAT IS NEW ABOUT BIG DATA
SO IT'S 4000 YEARS OLD
AND WHAT WE CAN DO IS WE CAN REUSE THIS INFORMATION FOR USES THAT WE NEVER EVEN IMAGINED WHEN WE FIRST
SO STOP TRYING TO CHANGE IT
WHAT'S WRONG WITH A IS THAT IT SETS THE INADVERTENT NORM THE BEHAVIOR THAT YOU'RE NOT
SO DON'T CHANGE ATTITUDES SET BEHAVIORAL EXPECTATIONS
BUT YOU WILL BE THE LEAST SUCCESSFUL IF YOU LET COMMON SENSE BE YOUR GUIDE
SO FRAMING LOSS CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE
WHEN PEOPLE ENGAGE IN THE BEHAVIORS YOU WANT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO MEASURE THE ATTITUDES YOU EXPECT
YOU MIGHT BE TRYING TO IMPROVE HEALTH YOU MIGHT BE TRYING TO CHANGE THE ENVIRONMENT ALL OF
THAT'S THE GREATEST PREDICTOR
ANYTIME THERE'S NO ACTION CAN YOU JUST WALK BY AND DROP SOMETHING IN
WE CAN BE SUCCESSFUL
SO THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME SHARE IT WITH YOU TODAY
MAKE YOUR CHANGE MEANINGFUL
THEY ALSO CARE ABOUT BUILDING GREEN BUILDINGS BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT IT SAVES RESOURCES LIKE ELECTRICITY AND
WHAT THEY REALLY SHOULD BE DOING IS BRINGING THEIR FRIEND WITH THEM AND ASKING THEIR FRIEND TO COME BY EVERY FIVE
ONE OF THE THINGS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON FOR DECADES IS TRYING TO REDUCE LITTERING TRYING TO GET US TO PUT OUR TRASH AND OUR WASTE
SO IF WE WANT TO MAKE AN IMPACT ON CLIMATE CHANGE WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT BUILDINGS
SO SOME SOCIAL SCIENTISTS WERE THINKING HOW DO WE GET HOMEOWNERS TO REDUCE THEIR ENERGY CONSUMPTION
THEY SENT AUDITORS OUT TO LOOK AT PEOPLE'S HOMES
PLEASE USE IT IN YOUR LIVES
BOYS NEED TO BE TOUGH STRONG HARD TOP DOG GET ALL THE CASH AND THE LADIES AND OF COURSE THEY'LL NEVER
WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT IT
WE GENDER OUR KIDS AS SOON AS THEY ARE BORN
AND EVEN IF MEN AS A WHOLE GROUP MIGHT BENEFIT FROM THE CURRENT SYSTEM IT LIMITS OPPORTUNITIES FOR
WE NEED TO CHALLENGE EVERYDAY SEXISM IN THE WORKPLACE AT HOME WITHIN OUR INSTITUTIONS AND WITHIN OUR
GIRLS HAVE MUCH HIGHER RATES OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION AND YOUNG WOMEN ARE TWICE AS LIKELY TO BE HOSPITALIZED
THE TOYS THAT KIDS PLAY WITH IMPACT THEIR SENSE OF REALITY AND FEELINGS OF WHAT THEY
WHAT WAS GOING GOING ON
WHY DID WE HAVE TO DO THIS
SO AGAIN WE'RE NOT BORN FEMININE OR MASCULINE
CAN YOU COMMENT
HOW THEIR WALKING STICKS KEPT THE FLAMES ALIVE
WILL IT STING LESS IF I SAY IT SOFTLY
BUT DO WE REALLY KNOW HOW MUCH WATER WE USE EVERY DAY
THINK ABOUT THAT
AND YET ARE THESE THINGS THE SAME VALUE IN TERMS OF MY LIFE
SIMPLE THINGS LIKE MOVING GENERATORS AND BOILERS TO THE SECOND FLOOR LIKE THEY'VE NOW
NO IT'S NOT THE INTERNET
THE AVERAGE AMERICAN USES ABOUT 100 GALLONS A DAY
THIS ISN'T TO JUDGE PEOPLE I EAT MEAT
IF YOU HAVE A VERY EFFICIENT SHOWER HEAD IT'S ACTUALLY A 12 HOUR SHOWER
THINGS WE DO IN OUR HOMES THINGS WE BUY THINGS LIKE FAUCETS AND TOILETS AND SHOWER HEADS AND
THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT WE CAN DO IN OUR COMMUNITIES AS WELL FOR SMARTER WATER USE THROUGH RE USE
WATER CAN BE A BLESSING OR A CURSE
ARE THEY REALLY THE BIGGEST WATER HOGS THOUGH
JUST LEAVE THE WATER ON ALL DAY WHEN YOU GO TO WORK
IN CALIFORNIA HALF OF THE URBAN WATER USE IS FOR OUTDOOR IRRIGATION
WE CAN ALSO MAKE SMART CHOICES AS CONSUMERS
AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT US
IT'S TRANSPORTED INTO YOUR HOME THANKS TO A LOCAL WATER AGENCY OR THROUGH A PIPE AND A PUMP OR
BUT MY MOST PROFOUND APPRECIATION FOR IT CAME ON A TRIP TO ZIMBABWE WHEN I WAS A YOUNG LAWYER
AND YET HERE WE WERE LESS THAN A MILE FROM AN ENORMOUS SOURCE OF FRESH WATER
YET THE CHILDREN DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO ANY OF IT BECAUSE OF POOR GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND A LACK OF
WE MUST RESPECT WATER
THIS IS POTENTIALLY SUCH IMPORTANT WORK
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING THIS WITH US
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT SUPERBUGS FOR A MOMENT
IT'S A WAR ON SUPERBUGS
AND OF COURSE WE WANT TO STERILIZE MOSTLY WHEN THERE ARE PEOPLE AROUND
AND OFTEN I GET ASKED QUESTIONS SO WHAT DOES THE FUTURE HOLD
PEOPLE WONDER DON'T YOU WANT TO SIGN WITH A MAJOR LABEL
I'LL NEVER FORGET IT
I MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS AND I FELT MORE COMFORTABLE TALKING TO PEOPLE BUT THERE WAS STILL ONE
OH SO YOU THOUGHT BY TRAVELING YOU COULD RUN AWAY FROM YOUR PROBLEMS
MINE WAS WHEN I REALIZED THAT IF I COULD CHANGE THE CIRCUMSTANCES I WOULD AND WHEN THAT LIGHT BULB WENT OFF I KNEW
I WANTED TO BE SPONTANEOUS AND SET MY OWN SCHEDULE
I WAS SITTING AT THIS CAFE IN SAN JOS HAVING A MORNING COFFEE AND I WAS READING A BOOK AND THE
EVEN THOUGH I KNEW MORE PEOPLE I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW ANYONE
IT'S FUNNY HOW THESE THINGS WORK SOMETIMES
FIVE DAYS LATER MY GIRLFRIEND BROKE UP WITH ME
FINALLY MY CHALLENGE TO YOU IS THIS
SO WHAT'S YOUR TURNING POINT GOING TO BE
WHATEVER THEY ARE PURSUE THEM
I WAS IN COSTA RICA RUNNING AWAY FROM MY PROBLEMS
THE TRIP WAS SUPPOSED TO LAST FOR 40 DAYS AND IT LASTED 12 AND THOSE 12 DAYS WERE FULL OF STRESS AND
IT WAS COLD AND I WAS MISERABLE
WHY WAS I THE ONE BEING REJECTED
AND IT HAPPENED BY GETTING TO KNOW OTHER PEOPLE'S STORIES AND BEING WILLING TO LET THEM GET TO KNOW MINE
TO BE HAPPY I STARTED DOING THINGS I WAS PROUD OF
YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE THAT CHOICE FOR YOURSELF
AND THERE IS NO IDEOLOGY THAT WILL TELL YOU WHERE YOUR PROPERTY ENDS
AND I'M HERE TO ARGUE THAT THIS IS BECAUSE CAPITALISM IN THE MODERN ITERATION IS LARGELY
AND FIVE OR TEN YEARS FROM NOW WHEN AMAZON WANTS TO DELIVER A PACKAGE OVER YOUR HOUSE TO YOUR NEIGHBOR FROM
AND THIS IS WHY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO THINK OF AMERICAN CAPITALISM AS AN OPERATING SYSTEM AND NOT AS AN
WHERE DOES IT END
AND THE OPERATING SYSTEM NEEDS TO KEEP UP
AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMEONE ARBITRATE THAT
AND INDEED THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED
AND SHE REPLIED WELL I HAVE NEVER BEEN TAUGHT TO ASK FOR CONSENT
5 MILLION PEOPLE
YOU WAKE UP ONE MORNING HOWEVER AND YOU DISCOVER THAT THE REASON THERE ARE NO RULES IS BECAUSE THERE'S NO GOVERNMENT
I WONDER WHAT THAT MEANS
DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS IS AN AMAZING ORGANIZATION DEDICATED AND DESIGNED TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY CARE
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO
HOW WILL I PAY THEM
IN WHAT CURRENCY WILL I PAY THEM
AT THAT POINT I THOUGHT MAYBE I COULD MAKE USE OF LEGOS THE TOYS THAT I USED TO PLAY SO MUCH WHEN I
I MADE USE OF AN IDEA
IT WAS REALLY INTERESTING
BOTH ARE VERY IMPORTANT FOR OUR SOCIETY
THE AIR PICKS UP MOISTURE FROM THE SURFACE OF WATER CARRIES IT INTO THE SPORES MAKES THEM MOVE AND THEY'RE
SPORES WILL SHOW THE WAY FOR THAT TOO
YOU ACTUALLY HAD BACTERIAL SPORES IN THERE
AND THEY HAVE VERY INTERESTING SHAPES
THEY ARE STIFFER THAN MOST PLASTICS AND THAT'S STRANGE
AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT IT DOES MAKE SENSE BECAUSE OUR BRAIN IS VERY ISOLATED
THEN I THINK STOP
THIS IS SIMPLY NOT POSSIBLE THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING BAD AROUND
I THOUGHT THAT WAS NICE
AND I USED TO NOT BE A GREAT FAN OF PUBLIC RESTROOMS BUT NOW I CAN GO ANYWHERE BECAUSE I
BUT JUST KNOWING ABOUT THESE KINDS OF RESEARCH THAT'S OUT THERE AT THE MOMENT HELPS ME IN MY DAILY
NOW WE COULD FIND GENES THAT COULD ACTUALLY SLOW THAT PROCESS DOWN
THEY WERE PROTECTED AGAINST ALZHEIMER'S
WE WERE SURPRISED
I THINK ANYONE WHO'S BEEN A PARENT KNOWS HOW THIS FEELS
IT WAS REALLY EXCITING
IT WAS EXTREMELY EXCITING
THE SAME NUMBER OF GENES BUT THEY AREN'T ALL SWITCHED ON AT THE SAME TIME
IN EVERY ONE OF YOUR CELLS
WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
WE DIDN'T REALIZE RESVERATROL AND THESE DRUGS ALL WORK THE SAME WAY BUT THEY DO
THEY WERE PROTECTED AGAINST CANCER
AND IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS WHAT WE DISCOVERED AS A GROUP WAS THAT YEAST CELLS DO IN FACT GROW OLD
SHE WENT STRAIGHT TO HOSPITAL
THEY OPERATED ON HER
ALZHEIMER'S HEART DISEASE CANCER THESE ARE NATURAL AND WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PREVENT AND
I REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO A DAY WHEN THIS HAPPENS AND WHEN IT DOES I BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO LOOK BACK AT TODAY LIKE WE DO
IN THAT MOMENT HE BECAME A SCHOLAR
TO MAKE THE FIRST TRANSCRIPTION OF THIS MANUSCRIPT IN 250 YEARS
THAT MEANS THAT MOUNTING RECOVERIES IS BEYOND THE REACH OF MOST RESEARCHERS AND ALL BUT THE WEALTHIEST INSTITUTIONS
THROUGH THIS LENS WE WITNESSED THE MISTAKES THE CHANGES OF MIND THE NAIVETES YOUNG CENSORED
THE REAL NUMBER IS LIKELY DOUBLE THAT
THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT TRANSFORMED ME FROM A MEDIEVAL SCHOLAR A READER OF TEXTS INTO A
THERE'S A COMPLETE STRANGER SLEEPING IN MY LIVING ROOM
I'VE GOT A 30 SECOND EXPERIMENT THAT WILL PUSH YOU PAST YOUR COMFORT ZONE
HOW DO SHARING AND TRANSACTIONS GO TOGETHER
WHAT ARE THE EMOTIONS THAT CAN BE MEASURED
AND YOU CAN ASK WHAT HAPPENS TO THESE MOMENTS
VERY DIFFERENT NOTION
THIS APPLIES TO LAYPEOPLE THINKING ABOUT THEIR OWN HAPPINESS AND IT APPLIES TO SCHOLARS THINKING ABOUT HAPPINESS
HE HAD HAD 20 MINUTES OF GLORIOUS MUSIC
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
BUT ONE OF THEM IS DISTINCTLY WORSE THAN THE OTHER
I LOVE THE JAZZ GREATS
THERE ARE FIVE IN THE SET
THIS IS A STARK CONTRAST TO THE CALM WATERY LIKE SOUND OF IMPRESSIONISM
IT'S LIKE A CONCRETE DOUGHNUT
IT'S NOT WORKING HOW I WANT IT TO WORK
THAT'S DECISION THAT'S THE MOMENT
WILL YOU HEAR HOW SELFISH OR CRAZY YOU ARE
IT'S THE ULTIMATE DRUG
YOU'RE RIGHT THERE
TOO CONFRONTING IT'S TOO OVERWHELMING
AS THEY DO THIS IS WHEN GREG REALIZES HE'S OUTGROWN THEM
SO I TRIED AN EXPERIMENT
IT'S THE FORMER BOY BAND ONE DIRECTION
PERHAPS THEN WE MIGHT FIND THE SAME THING THAT JO COX OBSERVED IN
FOR EXAMPLE THAT THEY WERE JUST OFF TO REHEARSE
YOU MIGHT REMEMBER THIS
MAYBE YOU'VE DONE IT AS WELL
ARE YOU INFLATING A BUBBLE OR ARE YOU BUILDING A BRIDGE
IT CAN HELP US TO BUILD BRIDGES
THAT WE HAVE FAR MORE IN COMMON THAN THE THINGS THAT DIVIDE US
THINK ABOUT IT
THEY WERE TELLING REALLY FUNNY STORIES
A REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS THAT YOU SEE A LOT IN THAT DATA IS THE HASHTAG FOR DIRECTIONERS
IT MIGHT BE A SHARED BELIEF IT MIGHT EVEN BE A SHARED EXPERIENCE
FIRST IT MULTIPLIES THE STORY ITSELF
YOU MIGHT BE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THAT EFFECT
THERE IS A NEW INDUSTRY FOR THESE PLACES
AND I THINK WE FOUND THE WAY TO GO FORWARD
OH THEY'RE GOING TO IYA BUT WHY
IT'S THERE AND IT CAN BE SAVED
AND OF COURSE THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE COME TO IYA FOR
THEY DID ALL THAT AND IT DIDN'T WORK
THIS IS HOW IT WAS IN MEIJI
EVERYTHING LOOKS FINE
OUR TEACHER TAUGHT US ETIQUETTE ON HOW TO ASK SOMEONE TO
BUT THAT'S FOR ANOTHER TALK
I WANTED IT SO BADLY
IT IS MY DREAM JOB
NOW I'M NO FARMER
IT'S PRETTY COOL WHEN YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO STARTS A BAKERY
AND RETURNING VETERANS WHO PARTICIPATE IN FARM PROGRAMS ARE FINDING THAT THEY HAVE LOWER
THE SAPARA FREELY PROVIDE THEIR TREATMENTS TO ANYONE THE
AND WHY I IMAGE THE WINDS IS BECAUSE THEY REMIND ME OF OUR CONNECTION TO EVERYTHING AS
WE'D PULL UP IN FRONT OF MY AUNT AND UNCLE'S HOUSE WITH ITS WHITE WOODED SIDING
FOR MILES THEY TRAVEL TO CUT THE TREES DOWN TO BUILD THEIR HOMES
IT'S FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
SO WE HAD TO HUG EVERYBODY BEFORE WE WENT OUTSIDE TO PLAY
WE ARE PART OF SPIRIT GRANDMOTHER AND GRANDFATHER
AND SLEEPILY WE'D GET BACK IN THE CAR AND GO BACK TO THE CITY
AND I REALIZED HOW BLESSED I WAS TO HAVE HIM IN MY LIFE
IT'S NO WONDER THAT'S A PART OF WHY WE GIVE
HERE'S THE OTHER PROBLEM WITH THAT
WHAT KIND OF IMPACT WOULD THAT HAVE HAD
I REALIZED AS I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF HUMAN NATURE
IT'S WITHIN OUR NATURE TO SEEK STORIES AND INSPIRATIONS
THAT FOOD YOU EAT COMES FROM SOMEWHERE
THE TAP WATER YOU DRINK COMES FROM SOMEWHERE
ONE IN THREE NATIVE WOMEN ARE RAPED IN HER LIFETIME
HOW CAN YOU HELP
IT'S IN OUR PLANTS IN OUR MEDICINES IN OUR LIVES EVERY SINGLE DAY
THAT WOULD CHANGE OUR LIVES IF TREATIES WERE ACTUALLY UPHELD
IT SHAPES THE WAY WE TEACH
ARE YOU MEETING THOSE REQUIREMENTS
WE WERE SO EMPOWERED
ONLY HALF OF THE US STATES MENTION MORE THAN A SINGLE TRIBE AND JUST FOUR STATES MENTION THE
PLEASE DO SOMETHING
THEY ARE NATIVE PEOPLE BEING PUSHED OFF THEIR HOMELANDS FROM RISING SEA LEVELS
IN FACT ONE RECENT STUDY FOUND THAT WHEN YOU DO TRY TO DIAGNOSE PEOPLE'S PERSONALITY USING RORSCHACH INKBLOT TESTS
BUT IN FACT WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT IF YOU ANALYZE THE PATTERN OF HITS AND MISSES STATISTICALLY IT
BUT AGAIN THIS IS A MYTH BECAUSE NEARLY EVERYTHING THAT YOU DO INVOLVES NEARLY ALL PARTS OF YOUR BRAIN TALKING TOGETHER
IF YOU THINK THEY'RE FIGHTING THAT MEANS YOU'RE A BIT MORE OF A NASTY AGGRESSIVE PERSON
SO BY COMPARING HOW SIMILAR GCSE RESULTS ARE IN IDENTICAL TWINS VERSUS NON IDENTICAL
A RECENT STUDY LOOKING AT PENALTY SHOOTOUTS IN FOOTBALL SHOWS THAT PLAYERS WHO REPRESENT COUNTRIES WITH A
SO A FAMOUS STUDY SURVEYED PEOPLE FROM 37 DIFFERENT CULTURES ACROSS THE GLOBE FROM AMERICANS TO ZULUS ON WHAT THEY
THE PEOPLE WHO PREFERRED MOZART MUSIC TO THE STORIES GOT A BIGGER IQ BOOST FROM THE MOZART THAN THE STORIES BUT THE PEOPLE WHO
BUT THIS STORY IS A MYTH FOR THREE REASONS
OKAY SO I'VE BEEN TALKING FOR ABOUT 12 MINUTES NOW AND YOU'VE PROBABLY BEEN SITTING THERE LISTENING TO ME ANALYZING MY SPEECH
YOUR BRAIN CREATES PATTERNS FROM THE RANDOMNESS
HOWEVER PERHAPS ONE REASON WHY THIS MYTH HAS SURVIVED IS THAT THERE IS A SLIGHT GRAIN OF TRUTH TO IT
AND THEY PLAYED THE PEOPLE THE MUSIC OR THE STORIES
SO HAVE YOU HEARD OF THE IDEA OF THE MOZART EFFECT
SO IT'S NOT REALLY A CASE OF MARS AND VENUS
IT'S MORE A CASE OF IF ANYTHING MARS AND SNICKERS
BASICALLY THE SAME BUT YOU KNOW ONE'S MAYBE SLIGHTLY NUTTIER THAN THE OTHER
MAYBE WE COULD LISTEN TO A NICE BIT OF MOZART
WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS BY INCREASING THE LENGTH OF OUR MEMBRANES AND ADDING IN MULTIPLE CHANNELS
50 MIXTURE OF CO2 TO METHANE INTO A 1
99 MIXTURE OF CO2 TO METHANE OR BETTER AND
IT HAS HALF THE CO2 EMISSIONS AND IT DOESN'T COME WITH THE TOXIC BYPRODUCTS THAT ARE FOUND IN COAL
SAPO 34 IS VERY STABLE
IT CAN FUNCTION UNDER A WIDE RANGE OF PRESSURES AND IT CAN TAKE TEMPERATURES UP TO 700
ALSO OUR SOCIETY IS MORE AND MORE BECOMING A PERFORMANCE BASED SOCIETY
AND THEY ACCEPT MORE OF BOYS THAN WOMEN
AS WE WERE DRIVING AWAY AND I WAS PLAYING WITH MY NEW FOUND TOY WE NEVER GAVE A SECOND THOUGHT TO THE GARBAGE WE
WELL THAT'S THE SECOND PART OF THE STORY THAT I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU
AND LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED
JILER DESCRIBES A PLACE THAT IS WELL KNOWN FOR GANG VIOLENCE AND IT REPORTS OF RECIDIVISM RATE UP OF
SO WE SET OUT TO SEE WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO BUILD A VERMICULTURE PROGRAM
WE SPENT VIRTUALLY NO MONEY TO BUILD THIS PROGRAM
PACHOLKE BOUGHT US AN AIR PUMP AND TAUGHT US HOW TO MAKE LIQUID FERTILIZER FROM THE CASTINGS
DOING SO IS THE FIRST STEP IN OVERCOMING THE ALL TOO COMMON PARADIGM OF
SO LIKE SNOOPY WE CAN'T JUST LIE THERE AND THINK GREAT THOUGHTS ABOUT OUR NEIGHBORS
BUT SOMETHING ELSE AS WELL ACTUALLY 18 MINUTES IS IMPORTANT
HE GOES TO THE ARK
IT ENTAILS UNDERSTANDING THE PAIN OF THE OTHER
TAKE IT HOME
I'VE GOT NO MONEY
IF YOU PUT BOILING WATER IN IT WILL SHATTER
WHAT DOES THIS COMPASSION ENTAIL
IT MEANS IT GETS FILLED WITH HOT AIR
AND WITHIN JEWISH TEACHINGS THE RABBINIC TEACHINGS WE HAVE HILLEL WHO TAUGHT THAT YOU
NEXT WEEK WITH RAISINS
SO IN JUDAISM WE HAVE FROM OUR TORAH THAT YOU SHOULD LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOU
I CALL THAT UNITY GOD
I KNOW WHAT GOD WANTS
HE GOES IN THERE AND IT'S NOT THERE
I'VE GOT CHILDREN TO FEED
WENT ON UNTIL A NEW RABBI CAME
TAKE THE BREAD
YOU'VE ANSWERED MY QUESTION
WHAT DOES IT MEAN DOUGH BECOMES LEAVEN
WE ALL I THINK BELIEVE IN COMPASSION
IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THE WORLD RELIGIONS ALL THE MAIN WORLD RELIGIONS YOU'LL FIND WITHIN THEM SOME
OH GOD I'M IN SUCH TROUBLE
HE GOES INTO THE SYNAGOGUE
RABBIS ALWAYS SPOIL THINGS
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO DO
SO WHEN I THOUGHT ABOUT COMPASSION MY MIND IMMEDIATELY WENT TO ONE OF THE CARTOON STRIPS
BECAUSE AFTER ALL GOD IS JUST
THEREFORE THERE SHOULD BE JUSTICE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD
AND HE PUT IT IN THE ARK WITH THE SCROLLS OF THE TORAH
I'LL TAKE YOU THERE
I DID THE BLACK GUY THING
LIKE I DON'T THINK THIS IS GOING TO WORK FOR ME
HOW MUCH BETTER WOULD OUR LIVES BE
HOW MUCH BETTER WOULD OUR COUNTRY BE
SO GO LOOKING FOR YOUR BIAS
I DIDN'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY TO PUT INTO THIS
FROM THERE I ENTERED THIS INTO THE SCIENCE FAIR IN COLORADO AND AT THE STATE SCIENCE FAIR
SO I REALLY LOOKED AROUND AND TRIED TO USE MY RESOURCES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
THE MAIN CONTROL SYSTEM FOR THE NEWER ADVANCED ONES ARE ALL NEURAL IMPLANTS WHICH IS AN OPEN
I HAVE A NEW DESIGN WHERE ALL THE MOTORS WERE CONCEALED WITHIN THE PALM OF THE HAND STILL THE SAME SIZE AND I GET OVER TWICE THE
I WAS 16 AT THE TIME
THAT'S JUST WHAT I HAD OF LAYING AROUND AND I WANT TO MAKE USE OF IT
SO THROUGHOUT LEARNING IT WAS A CHALLENGE
IF YOU TIMES THAT BY FIVE YOU GET INDIVIDUAL FINGER CONTROL OF A WHOLE HAND
IT IS THIS FEAR THAT'S FEEDING THE DIET INDUSTRY WHICH IS KEEPING SO MANY OF US FROM MAKING
NOTE THE WAYS IN WHICH YOU'RE LIKE
THAT'S A QUESTION THAT I THINK WE ALL OUGHT TO ASK OURSELVES
UNLESS SOMEBODY TELLS US WE WOULD NEVER KNOW
HOW CAN WE DO THE MOST GOOD AND THE LEAST HARM TO PEOPLE ANIMALS AND THE ENVIRONMENT THROUGH ALL OF OUR
AND IT WOULD BE ILLEGAL TO TAKE ANY OF THOSE BIRDS AND PUT THEM INTO A CAGE SO SMALL THAT THEY COULD NEVER STRETCH A WING
I LOVED THAT SHEEP
BACK THEN I ALSO HAPPENED TO BE A BIG FAN OF THE TELEVISION SERIES STAR TREK
PEOPLE SAID TO US CAN I GO IN FIRST
FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION WAS SOMETHING I FOUND OUT ABOUT SO COMPLETELY ACCIDENTALLY WHILST AT
SO I WANTED TO KNOW MORE
SO WHEN I'M FACING ON DOING SOMETHING REALLY MONOTONOUS AND REALLY LABORIOUS I HAVE TO WATCH
WHILST I WAS MAKING SOME OF THESE TEENY TINY ROSES
SO THEN I BECAME THAT PERSON TRYING TO WONDER HOW OR IF I COULD ASK MY FRIENDS TO
WHAT ELSE COULD I DO WITH PAPER
NOW I LITERALLY SAT FOR HOURS AND HOURS BY MYSELF IN MY LIVING ROOM MAKING EVEN
WHICH THEREFORE MEANT THAT I DIDN'T HAVE TO WAIT AND WATCH GLUE DRY
IT KIND OF STUCK TOGETHER BY ITSELF
I WASN'T THAT WEIRD OF A KID
BUT IF THAT PERSON IS TOTALLY INTO THE 36TH CHAMBER OF SHAOLIN
WE HIKED WE SWAM WE PRACTICED MARTIAL ARTS TOGETHER WE COULD DISCUSS ANYTHING FROM BLACK HOLES
I'D LEARNED TO LET GO OF THE SAFETY OF CONFORMITY AND I WAS READY TO MEET OTHER
AND GUESS HOW MANY I MET
THREE YEARS TO FIND 42 SUPERNOVAE BY SEARCHING THROUGH TENS OF THOUSANDS OF GALAXIES
ONE ROLL OF THE DICE WOULD TELL YOU VERY LITTLE BUT THE MORE TIMES YOU ROLLED THEM THE MORE DATA YOU
ABOUT THE EVOLUTION OF OUR UNIVERSE
WE EXPECT IT TO START TAKING DATA BY THE END OF THIS DECADE
AND IF WE WANT TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION WE HAVE TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND THE HISTORY OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM IN DETAIL
SO I DECIDED TO CREATE SOMETHING NEW
TO BE SURPRISED WITH THOSE UNPREDICTABLE TURNAROUNDS
AND I COULDN'T HAVE PREDICTED THIS TO BECOME SO BIG AND SUCCESSFUL
BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT REALLY IS BUT IT LOOKS SO
AND NO WONDER
AND WHY WOULD I DO THAT
THIS SUN IS NOT AFRAID TO SHOW HIS FACE
IT'S FURNISHED AT LEAST THREE SCIENCE FICTION TITLES I THINK BECAUSE IT SAYS POEMS CAN BRINGS US NEWS
THE SCOTTISH POET DENISE RILEY COMPARES POETRY TO A NEEDLE A SLIVER OF OUTSIDE I
IT'S ALSO ABOUT HOW APPEARANCES DECEIVE HOW OUR CULTURE CAN SWEEP US ALONG INTO DOING AND SAYING THINGS
POETRY CAN HELP US LIVE WITH THAT
POETRY HELPS ME WANT TO BE ALIVE AND I WANT TO SHOW YOU WHY BY SHOWING YOU HOW HOW A
I UNDERSTAND THE WORLD BEST MOST FULLY IN WORDS RATHER THAN SAY PICTURES OR NUMBERS AND
TO GO OUT TO TREES TO GO OUT TO FORESTS TO GO OUT TO NATURE TO MAKE NEW DISCOVERIES
WHAT WE FOUND HOWEVER WAS THAT THEY TOOK AN EXTREMELY LONG TIME OVER 20 YEARS TO REGENERATE
WE KNOW IT'S A LOT BUT WE DO NOT YET KNOW THE ANSWERS TO HOW MUCH AND BY WHAT PROCESSES CARBON
OR PERHAPS AL GORE AND NATURALLY 7 COULD MAKE A SONG ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE THAT WOULD REALLY
BEFORE ANY FORMAL INSTRUCTION BEGAN ALEXIS SAID WOW
WE ARE CONNECTING THEM TO THE ENDLESS POSSIBILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH TECHNOLOGY
A PLACE IN WHICH WE COME TOGETHER TO BRING ALL OUR DIVERSE PERSPECTIVES AND
THAT SOUNDED LIKE A SOAP OPERA THEN
BUT YOU'LL NEVER GET ANYWHERE
SO NOW WHEN WE LOOK TO RUSSIA AND THE FORMER SOVIET UNION AND OTHER COMMUNIST COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD IN MOST CASES WE'RE SEEING A
A LIFE OUTSIDE OF MAXIMUM CUSTODY
WHEN I ASKED HIM ABOUT THAT MOMENT HE SAID HE WAS TRYING TO REMEMBER THE LAST TIME THAT SOMEBODY HAD EXTENDED THEIR HAND TO HIM IN
INMATES WHO HAD ONCE REPEATEDLY VIOLATED THE RULES SLOWLY START TO DEMONSTRATE THE SKILLS TAUGHT THROUGH
HE SAID THAT THEIR SUPPORT ENCOURAGES HIM TO MAKE BETTER CHOICES AND TO THINK ABOUT HIS FUTURE
ALL OF MY INTERACTIONS TOOK PLACE WITH EITHER A STEEL DOOR OR A THICK VISITATION ROOM WINDOW BETWEEN
I'VE OVERHEARD OFFICERS IN MAXIMUM CUSTODY DESCRIBE THEIR ROLES AS ROOM SERVICE
OFFICERS THE STAFF THAT HAVE ALWAYS SPENT THE MOST TIME WITH INMATES ARE
HOW'S THAT WORKING OUT
YOU SAID THAT LAST WEEK
MIGHT MAKE IT MY NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION
THE BEST THINGS IN LIFE STEM FROM IDEAS RIGHT
THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE CONVENTIONAL DON'T LIMIT THEM TO SOLELY CAREERS OR JOBS BUT JUST REMEMBER THAT IF
ONE OF MY FAVORITE QUOTES FROM WALT DISNEY
ALL DEAD CARCASSES OF ANIMALS ARE RECYCLED BY MICROBES
YOU REMOVE ALL THE HARDWOOD AND SELL IT
THERE ARE 10000 SPECIES OF MICROBES IN THIS LITTLE GRAM OF SOIL
WE DON'T KNOW THAT ON A DAILY BASIS BUT YOU HAVE MORE MICROBIAL CELLS THAN HUMAN
AND I SAID SO AM I
WE NEED TO REDEFINE THE WAY THESE GUYS OPERATE
I SAID TO HIM I'VE GOT THE MOST AMAZING IDEA
AND THAT MONEY FUELS RESEARCH AND THAT RESEARCH WILL GET US TO A CURE
IT WAS THE END OF MOVEMBER
SO I GOT TO THE ARENA EARLY IN THE MORNING THE DAY OF THE SHOW WAITING OUT IN THE PARKING LOT TO SEE IF I COULD SPOT SOME WRESTLERS
I'M TRYING TO TEACH MY CHILDREN THAT TURNING YOURSELF UP IS JUST NOT SOME PERFECT IDEA OF HOW TO BE GREAT IT'S A WAY OF
IF YOU'VE EVER LOST SOMEONE YOU KNOW WHAT A DIFFICULT TIME THAT CAN BE
AND TURNING MYSELF UP MADE ME UNFORGETTABLE TO THE FANS
MAN THEY WOULD JUST PUNCH AND KICK ME HARD
I LEFT THE RING BUT GATOR STAYED WITH ME AND I USE THE TURNED UP VERSION OF MYSELF EVERY DAY
I FOUND OUT THAT ONCE SOMEONE HAS BEEN TURNED UP IT'S PRETTY HARD TO TURN THEM DOWN
MY ONE SON HE'S A WHIZ AT ELECTRONICS
HE WAS GONE
ONE OF THE WRESTLERS WHO'D BEEN ON THE SCENE A LONG TIME KNEW WHAT I WAS GOING THROUGH AND HE CAME OVER TO SEE HOW I WAS HOLDING UP
HE'S A COOL COWBOY WITH A GREAT LAST NAME
SO I COMMITTED TO THE IDEA THAT MY CHARACTER WASN'T GOING TO BE AS SCARY AS SOME OF THE OTHERS
I'D BE HILARIOUS FROM THE MOMENT I WALKED INTO THE ARENA
WITH EVERY WRESTLING MATCH I DUG DEEPER
BUT MY EXAMPLE OF IT IS A SIGN THAT I SAW IN A JEWELRY STORE
I'LL TELL YOU WHY
OR KIDS ASK THEIR PARENTS TO COME DOWN
YOU HAVE TO CALL A BEE KEEPER
WE COULDN'T KNOW 100
HOW ARE YOU MAINTAINING THIS
THESE FIELDS ARE COMPUTATIONAL DESIGN ALLOWING US TO DESIGN COMPLEX FORMS WITH
AND INFANTS DIE
ALL THE TIME YOU HAVE BEEN GIVEN AN ENVELOPE
NO I'M SORRY
IT'S NOT JUST INNOVATION COMPASSION AND PASSION COMPASSION IN THE HEART AND PASSION IN THE BELLY
THAT'S THE NEW WORLD THAT WE WANT TO CREATE
AND THEREFORE EACH COMPONENT HAD TO HAVE A DUAL FUNCTIONALITY
BUT I WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE THE SCHOOL BECAUSE MY POOR MOTHER COULDN'T AFFORD SCHOOLING
AND THEN HE SAID WELL I MUST GIVE THEM A CAR THAT THEY CAN AFFORD ONE LAKH CAR 2000 CAR
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT
I'VE GOT AN IDEA
BUT IT IS THIS THIRD CATEGORY THAT IS MOST INTRIGUING TO US THOSE OF US AGAIN WHO ARE DESIGNERS
BUT FRANKLY THAT'S JUST HALF THE STORY
I DO KNOW THAT PROSTITUTION IS ALL ABOUT TRADING SEX FOR THINGS OF VALUE
THEY WERE STICKS AND STONES AND BONES AND ANTLERS AND MINERALS AND FOR
MY FOURTH OBSERVATION HAS TO DO WITH METHODOLOGY
SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE VERY FIRST HUMANS VERY FIRST HUMANS ON THIS EARTH FOR THEM THINGS
SPACES BEING PLACES THEY COULD OCCUPY
AND THEY DID JUST THAT
FOR EXAMPLE THEY TOOK CLAY AND FIRE AND MADE CERAMICS AND POTTERY
AND THESE PEOPLE WERE AS WELL
WE EXPERIENCE WHAT SHE CALLED THE CHOICE OVERLOAD PROBLEM
IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE ARCHERY
DO I UNDERSTAND IT
AND WE ADJUST
AND HIS ANSWER SURPRISED ME
WE'RE THINKING ABOUT IT
THEN THROUGH THIS I LEARNED ONE REALLY IMPORTANT LESSON THAT THROUGH THE INTERNET ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING NOWADAYS
BUT IN MY OPINION WE ARE JUST GETTING STARTED
THERE ARE MILLIONS MORE OF ME OUT THERE
I EXPECTED I'D WALTZ INTO THAT LAB IT WOULD MAGICALLY WORK IN LIKE THE FIRST WEEK
IS DRIVING THE WORLD INTO LIKE THIS FREEFALL AND WE'RE GOING TO UNCLEAR AND LIKE JUST EXPLODE
5 BILLION MORE PEOPLE
ALL THESE RECORDS ARE BROKEN
5 BILLION PEOPLE COULD DO AND JUST IMAGINE WHAT YOU COULD DO
WHEN THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET THEY COULD BE LIKE ME
THE INTERNET IS BECOMING ACCESSIBLE TO 3
YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENED IS IN THE 1970S AT THE OLYMPICS ALL THESE RECORDS HAD
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY
IT WAS TESTED IN BLIND STUDIES WITH HUMANS
IN ADDITION YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR DOCTOR'S FEES AND ALL OF THESE SUBORDINATE ASSOCIATED FEES WITH THAT
AND THAT'S NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE
THAT WAS THE BIG QUESTION HERE
BUT IN REALITY HE WAS JUST AS MISERABLE AS I WAS
THAT'S NOT THE POINT
I THINK ABOUT MY SWEETHEART OR MY CLOSEST FRIENDS OR THE SONGS THAT TRAVEL WITH ME WHEREVER I HAPPEN TO BE
AND THE NUMBER OF US WHO LIVE OUTSIDE THE OLD NATION STATE CATEGORIES IS INCREASING SO QUICKLY
SHE REALIZES THAT SHE PROBABLY HAS MUCH MORE IN COMMON WITH HIM THAN WITH ANYBODY ENTIRELY OF
MY OPPONENT RAN THE CLASSIC PARTISAN PLAYBOOK
BUSH'S BUDGET DIRECTOR
AND IN TULSA WE HAVE DECIDED TO BUILD A CITY WHERE REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS USE
BYNUM A GUY WHOSE NAME REMINDS PEOPLE OF A CIRCUS PROMOTER
OVER 150 PROGRAMS HAD THEIR FUNDING REDUCED BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT DEMONSTRATE
BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE FOCUSED ON A GOAL AND YOU CAN TEST DIFFERENT STRATEGIES QUICKLY
AND WE STUCK TO THOSE RELENTLESSLY THROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN ALWAYS BRINGING IT
WE'VE FOUND IT TO BE AN ENGINE FOR CREATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING
AND SO ON ELECTION DAY I G
HE PUBLICIZED A LETTER HE SENT TO PRESIDENT OBAMA PROTESTING SYRIAN REFUGEES EVEN THOUGH NONE OF
MITCH DANIELS SERVED AS GEORGE W
THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM IS THAT TO WIN AN ELECTION YOU HAVE TO DUMB IT DOWN AND PLAY TO YOUR
AND USING THIS THEY EVALUATED OVER 1000 FEDERAL PROGRAMS
NOW WHEN MAYOR O'MALLEY TOOK OFFICE HE WAS A BIG FAN OF WHAT THEY'D BEEN ABLE TO DO IN NEW YORK CITY WHEN IT CAME TO
AND THE OVERALL APPROACH IS A VERY SIMPLE ONE
LET'S GRASP THE OPPORTUNITY THAT IS PRESENTED BY INNOVATION TO BUILD BETTER COMMUNITIES FOR
THAT IS THE PATH TO A BETTER FUTURE FOR US ALL
DURING THAT TIME HE CREATED WHAT WAS CALLED THE PART TOOL
WHY DO WE ALWAYS ALLOW OURSELVES TO FALL BACK ON PHILOSOPHICAL DISAGREEMENTS THAT ULTIMATELY
HE PUBLICIZED HIS ENDORSEMENT OF DONALD TRUMP
WELL O'MALLEY LOVED THAT APPROACH AND HE APPLIED IT IN BALTIMORE
OF COURSE NOT
AND A FUNNY THING HAPPENED WHEN WE DID THAT
SO LAST YEAR I RAN FOR MAYOR OF MY HOMETOWN TULSA OKLAHOMA
AND I WAS THE UNDERDOG RUNNING AGAINST A TWO TERM INCUMBENT
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME
INCREASING PER CAPITA INCOME IN OUR CITY INCREASING OUR CITY'S POPULATION
LOUISVILLE HAS USED THIS NOT JUST FOR THEIR CITY BUT IN A COMMUNITY WIDE EFFORT BRINGING
GIULIANI SHRUNK THAT TIME FRAME SO THAT CRIME STATISTICS WOULD BE COLLECTED ON A DAILY EVEN
10 MILLION HITS
IT'S HARDER TO FIND SOMEBODY WHO'S ON THE OTHER SIDE
SO AMERICA HAD A MID 20TH CENTURY THAT WAS REALLY BIPARTISAN
LOOK HE WAS
EMPATHY IS TRADITIONALLY FRAMED AS OH I FEEL YOUR PAIN
SO THEY'RE OVER THERE THEY'RE FAR AWAY
I CAN PUT MYSELF IN YOUR SHOES
LET ME GOOGLE THAT OH MY GOD
DIVERSITY AND IMMIGRATION DO A LOT OF GOOD THINGS
AND IF YOU VALUE HAVING A GENEROUS WELFARE STATE YOU'VE GOT TO EMPHASIZE THAT WE'RE ALL THE SAME
THERE ARE MANY EXCELLENT REASONS TO GO TO MARS BUT FOR ANYONE TO TELL YOU THAT MARS WILL BE THERE TO BACK UP HUMANITY
NO THEY'RE IN FACT TWO SIDES OF THE SAME GOAL TO UNDERSTAND PRESERVE AND IMPROVE LIFE INTO THE
HE'S AN 18 YEAR OLD BOY
HE SAID BUT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER
BY NOW I'VE GOT PRIDE
I WAS PASSIONATE ABOUT SPORTS
TRUST ME MR
BUT I'M SURE EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM HAS TAUGHT A GARY AND WHEN YOU'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF
SO WHAT HAPPENED NEXT
AND MAKING SENSE OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT
SHE'S RUNNING OUT OF TIME SHE SAID
I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE IT WAS A GREAT ERROR
YOU KNOW IT INSPIRES US
SO WHEN THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT I HAD TO MAKE A FEW ARRANGEMENTS LET ME TELL YOU
THAT'S EIGHT YEARS OF AMERICAN HISTORY EIGHT MINUTES OF MY ACT JUST GONE LIKE THAT
IT HAS FISH THAT'S ALL
NOW HE'S GONE
SO WHAT I THOUGHT I'D DO IS IN HONOR OF EMMANUEL IS WHAT I CAN DO IS TO
I JUST THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT
AND WHAT'S MORE YOUR WIFE HAS JUST RUN OFF WITH YOUR BEST FRIEND
YOUR HOUSE HAS CAUGHT FIRE
SO IT'S EXTRAORDINARY
IT'S A NEW WORLD THAT'S VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO MAKE SENSE OF
BUT YOU KNOW HE'S GONE
IT'S RATHER LIKE THAT LINE IN THE FILM AS GOOD AS IT GETS
SO WHERE DO WE LOOK FOR INSPIRATION
AND SHE'S DESPERATE TO FIND MORE EVIDENCE FOR THE LINK
300 YEARS AGO HE'D HAVE BEEN BURNT AT THE STAKE FOR THAT
YESTERDAY DAVID DEUTSCH ANOTHER ONE WHO COVERED MOST OF WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY
AND BEING ENGLISH WHEN I FIRST HEARD THAT I THOUGHT WHAT A LOAD OF COCK
YOU KNOW IT'S THE END OF AN ERROR SIC
THAT'S WHY THE PRIME MINISTER WENT ON TELEVISION
IT DIDN'T HAVE THAT KIND OF COLLATERAL
THIS WHOLE WHAT BEN BERNANKE HAS SAID THE CHAOTIC UNWINDING OF THE WORLD'S FINANCIAL SYSTEM IT'S
WE HAVE A NEW MAN
THIS WAS NEVER ANTICIPATED
AS PHYSICAL AND MENTAL ACTIVITY WAS ENORMOUS
THE NUMBER OF DISEASES THAT ARE TREATABLE BY EXERCISE IS
THE INCREASE OF HEIGHT OF 10CM DURING THE LAST FEW HUNDRED YEARS SEEMS TO HAVE
OBESITY CAN CAUSE DIABETES HEART DISEASE AND CANCER
SEEING AN ATTRACTIVE YOUNG LADY
HERE AT WASHINGTON CORRECTIONS CENTER FOR WOMEN THERE ARE MANY PROGRAMS THAT HELP WOMEN
THE TRAC PROGRAM IS A 16 WEEK COURSE THAT TRAINS AND TESTS OFFENDERS IN BECOMING CARPENTERS
IT'S BECAUSE OF THESE PROGRAMS THAT I NOW STAND BEFORE YOU WITH THE JOB SKILLS AND THE WORK
I'M TALKING ABOUT COMING TO PRISON
I'M JUST GOING TO HIGHLIGHT FOUR OF THESE PROGRAMS
SHE WENT AND TOOK HER INITIAL TESTING ALSO KNOWN AS HELL DAY
TRADE RELATED APPRENTICESHIP COACHING PROGRAM
SO IT WAS BROUGHT TO THE WASHINGTON STATE SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND'S SUPERINTENDENT FOR ANGELA TO WORK AT THE SCHOOL
WHEN MARY GOT OUT WITH THE HELP OF HER EMPLOYERS HERE AT WCCW SHE RELEASED DIRECTLY
TEXTBOOKS STATE EXAMS MUSIC AND MANY MORE THINGS TO HELP PROVIDE INDEPENDENT LIVING
BUT I'M SURE MOST OF YOU CAN AGREE YOU DIDN'T HAVE MUCH SENSE EITHER AT 14
HOPEFULLY YOU'LL SEE PAST THE METAL DETECTOR YOU WENT THROUGH THE RAZOR WIRE YOU WALKED PAST AND THE GREEN IDS
BUT THIS PIECE OF PLASTIC IS JUST THAT
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE BAD HAIR DAY
I MEAN REAL SUPERPOWERS
HOW WAS HE TO FEED THEM
WHY THE DIFFERENCE
EVERY TIME IT RAINED HE'D BE OUT THERE RUNNING WATCHING SEEING WHAT WAS GOING ON
AND THEN BUT DON'T WORRY NO ONE WAS HURT BECAUSE AT JUST THE LAST MOMENT BEFORE THEIR PART OF THE
HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT DOING THAT
WELL THE SAME AS THE PHIRIS
AND HOW DID WE BEGIN
IT'S ABOUT PARTNERING WITH NATURAL SYSTEMS NOT FIGHTING THEM
SO TO FURTHER SPARK THAT WILL I WROTE AND PUBLISHED HOW TO BOOKS DID COUNTLESS TALKS AND WITH OTHERS
AND AS HE SAID GETTING VERY WET BUT BEING VERY HAPPY
AND BY DOING THIS THOUGH IT WAS MUCH MORE MANAGEABLE AND HE COULD MOVE ALL THE WATER WITH THE FREE POWER OF GRAVITY
WE SQUANDER THE NATURAL ABUNDANCE THAT WE ALREADY HAVE AND WE SPEND VAST AMOUNTS OF RESOURCES TRYING TO
BUT EVENTUALLY THE STORM CLOUDS BUILT AND THEN WHEN THE RAINS CAME THE FLOODS WERE EPIC
SO LET'S LOOK AT THAT
WE STILL HAD THESE SPONGE LIKE FORESTS ALONG THE RIVER THAT WOULD ABSORB THAT RAIN AND
AND TO DO THIS WE HAD TO BASICALLY COME UP WITH AN
WHAT ABOUT IN OUR ACTUAL DAY TO DAY LIFE
AND I WANT TO JUST BRING IT BACK TO CAPTAIN JEFF DAVIS
PRETTY SOON WE COULD TELL THEY WERE SUCCESSFULLY MIND WANDERING BECAUSE THEY'D PRESS THE BUTTON WHEN THAT FACE WAS UPSIDE DOWN EVEN THOUGH IT'S
YOU UP FOR IT
IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN POSSIBLY DO ABOUT THIS
WE CALL IT THE N170 COMPONENT AND WE USE THIS COMPONENT IN MANY OF OUR STUDIES
AND UNDER STRESS IT'S EVEN WORSE WE MIND WANDER MORE POWERFULLY AND MORE OFTEN
IN WHICH WE COULD HAVE PEOPLE GENERATE THEIR OWN MIND WANDERING
WHERE IS YOUR ATTENTION RIGHT NOW
WHAT ABOUT IN THE REAL WORLD
BUT THAT'S ALL IN THE CONTEXT OF THESE VERY CONTROLLED LABORATORY SETTINGS
TO BRING IT BACK I'D LIKE TO MAKE A PREDICTION ABOUT YOUR ATTENTION FOR THE REMAINDER OF MY TALK
OR A SURGEON OR FIREFIGHTER MISSING ANY TIME
OFTEN IT HAPPENS WITHOUT OUR AWARENESS
TO US THIS WAS VERY COMPELLING
HE WAS PROMOTED TO MAJOR
WHAT ABOUT NOW
SO WE WANTED TO KNOW HERE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PEOPLE HAVE MIND WANDERING
AND THINGS LIKE STRESS AND MIND WANDERING DIMINISH ITS POWER
WE MAKE ERRORS
AND PERHAPS EVEN MORE IMPRESSIVE IS THAT IF PEOPLE TAKE OUR TRAINING PROGRAMS OVER LET'S SAY EIGHT WEEKS AND THEY
THE BRAIN IS A HIGHLY EFFICIENT ENERGY DEMANDING ORGAN THAT GETS FULLY UTILIZED
IN SOME SENSE IT'S YOUR BRAIN'S BOSS
HIS MIND WAS WORRIED AND PREOCCUPIED AND HAD STRESSFUL MEMORIES AND REALLY DREAD FOR HIS
HE ACTUALLY THEN ENDED UP RETIRING FROM THE MARINE CORPS
BUT BEFORE I TELL YOU ABOUT WHAT MINDFULNESS TRAINING IS OR THE RESULTS OF THAT STUDY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO
THEY WERE DISCERNING
SO ONE QUESTION WE MIGHT ASK IS WHY DO WE DO THIS WHY DO WE MIND WANDER SO MUCH
A CONSTRUAL BEING HOW WE PERCEIVE THE WORLD AROUND US AND CRUCIALLY HOW WE PERCEIVE PEOPLE'S BEHAVIORS
WORKING TO CREATE VIBRANT DIVERSE AND HARMONIOUS COMMUNITIES
PEOPLE WHO HAD STARTED THE DAY AS STRANGERS WERE BY THE END OF IT SHARING MUTUAL
IMAGINE BEING IN A SPACE LIKE THAT YOURSELF
THEY DON'T WANT WHAT THEY CALL RADICAL FEMINISTS' TELLING THEM WHAT THEY CAN AND CANNOT DO
SO WHERE TO BEGIN
WELL FOR ME IT BEGINS WITH PHASING OUT ONE WORD
THERE'S EVEN AN ORGANIZATION CALLED WOMEN AGAINST FEMINISM AND WHILE THEY HAVE A LOT OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT
BUT HOW COULD SHE BECOME ONE
OR BEING COMPLETELY UNAWARE OF YOUR OWN POTENTIAL
CRIME BECOMES A WAY OF SURVIVAL
OUR ONLINE PLATFORM WHICH WE'RE PLANNING TO LAUNCH SOON WILL ALLOW ANYONE OF YOU TO CONTRIBUTE TO EMPOWERING YOUTH IN
WELL QUITE SIMPLY THEY LOST INTEREST
THEY HAD NOTHING TO WAKE UP TO IN THE MORNING
I DECIDED TO SET UP A NETWORK OF PARTNERS IN THE COMMUNITY
CAN YOU IMAGINE BEING TRAPPED AND IMPRISONED IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT DOESN'T ALLOW YOU TO GROW
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HER NAME OR HER AGE BUT I COULDN'T GET HER OFF MY MIND
AND THERE'RE SO MANY OTHER WAYS TO GET INVOLVED
WHERE WAS SHE
AND I REALIZED AT THAT MOMENT I HAD TO FIND SOMEONE WHO COULD OFFER HER SOME GUIDANCE
VIOLENCE BECOMES A WAY TO EXPRESS THEIR FRUSTRATION
AND THEIR SELF ESTEEM AND SELF CONFIDENCE WENT UP ONCE THEY REALIZED WHAT THEY'RE CAPABLE OF
THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE ENGAGE THEM IN SOMETHING THEY'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT
THEY HAD EITHER DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL OR WERE UNEMPLOYED
BUT DID THESE JOBS REALLY FULFILL THEM AS INDIVIDUALS
WHAT ARE THEIR INDIVIDUAL PASSIONS
FOR THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS SHE'S BEEN TAKING PRIVATE LESSONS WITH A VOLUNTEER FASHION DESIGN INSTRUCTOR AND
A STUDY BY A US NATIONAL NEWSPAPER ESTIMATED THAT IN THE UNITED STATES
ALTHOUGH CERTAIN COUNTRIES STARTED TO IMPLEMENT PERFORMANCE BASED REIMBURSEMENT ANCHORED ON A QUALITY AND
AND I PREPARED WELL
LAST YEAR I WAS APPROACHED BY THE PLASTIC OCEANS FOUNDATION WHO ASKED ME NOT JUST TO BE A PATRON BUT ALSO TO
WHERE DOES IT GO
IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME TO MAKE EYE CONTACT WITH EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONES WHO ALLOW ME TO GO
I MADE IT MY MANTRA
MY LAST BIG PROJECT I WAS THE BEST IN THE WORLD
IT'S DIFFICULT TO BE FIRST BUT IT'S A VERY LONG LINE OF FAST FOLLOWERS WANTING TO BE SECOND
I LABOUR STILL AT THE EDGES OF HER LANGUAGE MANAGING A FEW ROTE LANE SENTENCES OF
MY EXPERIENCES OF BEFRIENDING THOSE AWAITING DEPORTATION TOGETHER WITH MY EXPERIENCE OF RESEARCHING
IN OTHER READINGS IT WARNS OF ARROGANCE OF PRIDE IN GRAND ACHIEVEMENTS
AND I'M HOPELESSLY BAD AT THIS
IN A VERY REAL SENSE WE WERE REFUSING TO LIVE IN AN ENGLISH ONLY WORLD
TEMPORARY RELIEF COMES BY ALLOWING PEOPLE TIME OUT IN A LANGUAGE IN WHICH THEY CAN REST
SO TO PRESENT A TALK IN ENGLISH IS TO CONTINUE THE STRUCTURES OF INEQUALITY AND INJUSTICE
AT THE BOTTOM IT SAYS
AND IT MAKES US BOTH LAUGH WHEN I DO
AND IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLE
MY CNBC SHOW
SO I WENT TO DR K AND I SAID HEY I'M JUST OUT OF SCHOOL I WANT TO BUILD A BILLION DOLLAR COMPANY
AND THE REASON THAT IS CRITICAL IS BECAUSE IF THINGS I BELIEVE IN THE LAW OF ATTRACTION BUT IF THINGS HAPPENED
WE CAN'T AFFORD IT
I HAD NO IDEA HOW I WAS GOING TO DO THAT
WHAT I REALIZED IN THAT PROCESS THOUGH WAS THE SECOND POINT WHICH IS WE HAVE TO GET REALLY
HE CAME BACK THE NEXT DAY GAVE US 250000 AND THAT REALLY KICKED OFF THAT FIRST COMPANY FOR ME AND IT ALSO EARNED ME
AND THAT TIMEPIECE KEEP IT IN MIND WHETHER IT'S 9 MONTHS OR SOME OTHER TIME FOR YOU THAT'S CRITICAL TOO
WE NEED YOU
I AM NOT A TRAINED TELEVISION PERSONALITY
GO BACK TRY IT AGAIN
THE PLANE LANDED CALLED DR K I SAID I FIGURED IT OUT
SO I HAD MY OWN SPECIAL PARKING SPOT
AND WHAT YOU'RE CALLED TO DO IS TO DO EVERYTHING IN YOUR POWER TO EMPOWER A BILLION
SO I KNEW THAT EVERYTHING THAT I WAS DOING THEN FROM THAT POINT FORWARD AND THAT WAS JUST A YEAR AGO MY
AND THEY SAID YOUR DAUGHTER IS NOT ONLY LEARNING DISABLED BUT WE BELIEVE SHE'S RETARDED
THEY GET NO GREAT PLEASURE FROM WHAT THEY DO
THERE ARE GREAT ONES LIKE KIPP'S IT'S A GREAT SYSTEM
THERE ARE MANY GREAT MODELS
THEY ARE TAKING STEALING SO MUCH OF OUR TIME OUR LOVE OUR
HONESTLY WHAT WOULD YOU SEE
SILENT WHEN SHE SPOKE SLOWLY TO MY FRIEND AND THEN WALKED ARM IN ARM WITH HIM LIKE A FASHIONABLE BRACELET
IN THIS ENVIRONMENT SOUND TRAVELS MUCH MORE EFFICIENTLY THAN LIGHT DOES AS WHALES HAVE LEARNED
SO WHEN TIDES ARE AT THEIR PEAK STRESS OR WHAT WE CALL THE TIME OF ENCOURAGING STRESS
YOU MIGHT WANT TO STRETCH AROUND A LITTLE BIT
ITS THICK ATMOSPHERE NOT ITS DISTANCE FROM THE SUN IS THE REASON
THERE ARE ABOUT FIVE OF THESE IN THE WORLD
I READ AND TAUGHT THE SAME CLASSICS THAT PEOPLE HAD BEEN READING AND TEACHING FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS
AND SO OUT OF THE BLUE I DECIDED TO WRITE TO THE LEAD IMAGING SCIENTIST ON THE ARCHIMEDES PALIMPSEST
IMAGINE WORLDWIDE HOW A TROVE OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN
THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT TRANSFORMED ME FROM A MEDIEVAL SCHOLAR A READER OF TEXTS INTO A
WHAT AN UNSATISFYING WORD READER IS
SO FUSION CENTERS ARE THESE JOINT TASK FORCES BETWEEN LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT ARE
BUT WHEN A PRESIDENT REPURPOSES THE POWER OF FEDERAL SURVEILLANCE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
KENNEDY AND HIS BROTHER ROBERT KENNEDY WHO KNEW ABOUT AND APPROVED THE SURVEILLANCE OF DR
THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE HAS DISPROPORTIONATELY AUDITED GROUPS THAT HAVE TEA PARTY
SO PLEASE JOIN ME AND LET'S GET TO WORK
WE NOTICE WHEN THOSE LAWS ARE BROKEN AND THERE'S SOME OF KIND OF RAMIFICATION OR PUNISHMENT

OPENNESS GENERATES PUBLIC ACTIVISM AND PUBLIC ACTIVISM GENERATES POLITICAL
TAKE FOR EXAMPLE ZIMBABWE
PLANTS FOR EXAMPLE ARE ABLE TO MEMORIZE
HOW DOES THAT WORK
IT REMOVES CARBON DIOXIDE FROM THE AIR
IN FACT YOU GET MORE BANG FOR YOUR BUCK
SO IT'S THESE IDEAS THAT I ASK YOU
INVITE PEOPLE INTO YOUR SPACE
THAT'S A LARGE IMPACT TO THINK ABOUT MY MONEY
TRY THAT ON
MY SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY EACH WEEK
I'M LUCKY ENOUGH TO MEET A BIG GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING TEXTBOOK FUNDRAISING
IT GAVE BACKPACKS TO CHILDREN WHO HAD NEVER HAD BACKPACKS TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL
SO THERE'S TWO WAYS TO FIND MONEY THROUGH CREATIVELY LOOKING INTO THE WORLD AROUND YOU BUT ALSO REACHING INTO YOUR OWN
WHY ARE WE SPENDING 80 BILLION DOLLARS ON A PRISON INDUSTRY THAT WE KNOW IS FAILING WHEN WE COULD TAKE THAT
I CAME OUT AS A PROSECUTOR EXPECTED TO DO JUSTICE BUT I NEVER LEARNED WHAT JUSTICE WAS IN MY CLASSES NONE OF US DO
I WOULD CHOOSE WHETHER TO LEVERAGE CHRISTOPHER INTO A PLEA DEAL OR TAKE THE CASE TO TRIAL AND ULTIMATELY I WOULD BE IN A POSITION TO ASK FOR
THE NEXT TIME THERE'S A LOCAL DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S ELECTION IN YOUR JURISDICTION ASK CANDIDATES THESE QUESTIONS
WITHOUT THOSE PROTECTIVE FACTORS IN HIS LIFE CHRISTOPHER WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO COMMIT FURTHER MORE SERIOUS CRIME
THOSE CONVICTED OF MURDER WERE CONDEMNED TO DIE IN PRISON AND IT WAS DURING THOSE MEETINGS WITH THOSE MEN THAT I
THE POTENTIAL JAIL TIME HE FACED IS WHAT STRESSED CHRISTOPHER OUT THE MOST
I WAS STANDING IN ARRAIGNMENTS THAT DAY WHEN CHRISTOPHER'S CASE CAME ACROSS MY DESK
BECAUSE WHEN YOU ADJUST YOUR MIND YOU ADJUST TO SUCCEED
I DECIDED TO SEND A TEXT ARE YOU OK
I TOOK A DEEP BREATH
MOVE FORWARD WITH YOUR ACTION PLAN
I GOT A TEXT BACK I'M TIRED
NOW THERE WAS A TIME I WOULD HAVE HANDLED THIS ALL WRONG
NOW THIS BLEW MY MIND BECAUSE THERE WERE TIMES WHEN I WAS YOUNG I USED TO WORRY SO MUCH AS A TEENAGER I
HOW CAN YOU TURN THIS PAIN INTO POSITIVE PRODUCTION
THE BARBER SAID TO ME KINJA YOU ARE TAKING THIS VERY VERY WELL
THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO GET RID OF
I STEPPED OUT OF THE VEHICLE AND I STARTED MY PROCESS
I TOOK A DEEP BREATH
THIS WAS THE IDEA THAT WE TRIED TO REALIZE IN THE LAST FEW YEARS
IT'S VERY EARLY TO PREDICT WHAT ELSE WE CAN OBSERVE
WHAT HAPPENED WAS IN THAT CASE WE GO FROM A SITUATION WHERE WE STARTED WHERE
THAT IS I'M NOT GOING INTO THE DETAILS OF THAT ONE TODAY BUT IT'S A TRANSITION FROM A NORMAL
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT IT'S NOT SO OBVIOUS BECAUSE IF YOU TAKE ONE MOLECULE AT A TIME AND
IT'S MUCH EASIER TO MODEL MATHEMATICALLY OR AT LEAST WE THINK SO
BUT UNFORTUNATELY I'M AN EXPERIMENTALIST WHICH MEANS FOR ME IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO BE PRESENT WHILE IT TAKES PLACE
IT'S VERY UNLIKELY THAT ANY OF US WILL LIVE FOR LONG ENOUGH FOR THIS TO HAPPEN AGAIN
WHY SHOULD YOU BE DOING THAT
AND WE'RE SEEING THAT ALREADY WITH SAY PHONES
THEY'RE GOING TO TALK TO THE MACHINE
THAT'S A BIG DISK
WHAT ABOUT THE EYES
WHAT DO YOU THINK KARAJAN'S REPLY WAS
AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES THEM INTO PARTNERS
YOU KNOW WHY
YOU HAVE THIS CONTROL
SO YOU ARE UNDER TREMENDOUS PRESSURE BECAUSE I DON'T GIVE YOU INSTRUCTION AND YET YOU HAVE TO GUESS MY MIND
IT'S NOT THAT
THAT'S THE FIRST ONE
SO HE HAD TO RESIGN
ISN'T THAT NICE
IT DOESN'T WORK
SHE SAID I DON'T WANT TO PUT THEM IN THE TRAY
I CAN'T EVEN GET MY FOUR YEAR OLD DAUGHTER TO PICK UP THREE HAIR PRETTIES
I NO LONGER SEE CONFLICT AS NEGATIVE
IT'S HARD WORK THOUGH
BUT I'VE BEEN WORRIED AND SAD
I TOLD HER ABOUT HOW I WAS BULLIED WHEN I WAS A KID
NOW I AM NO STRANGER TO BEING STUCK IN CONFLICT
I ASKED HER HOW SHE WAS FEELING
SO I TRIED TO PUT A STOP TO IT
AFTER I ASK I CAN LISTEN
HOW YOU CAN CREATE THE CHANGE THAT YOU WANT
I'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE
I HAVE TO OWN THAT
I TRIED TO BREATHE IN AND LET GO OF MY DESIRE TO HAVE HER RESPOND
I ALSO HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT BECAUSE CONFLICT IS ABOUT CHANGE THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME LOSS INVOLVED
IT CAN BE AS HARD AS TRYING TO LEARN A NEW LANGUAGE
I'VE CREATED THE ACRONYM VOCAB TO HELP YOU IN THOSE MOMENTS TO THINK ABOUT HOW YOU CAN
CAN YOU HELP ME UNDERSTAND
WE DISCUSSED HOW SHE COULD SET BOUNDARIES WITH KIDS AT SCHOOL
I STARTED LEARNING ABOUT CONFLICT BECAUSE I WAS TERRIBLE AT IT
WHAT IF CONFLICT ISN'T A PROBLEM
AFTER 15 YEARS OF STUDYING RESEARCHING TEACHING AND TRAINING IN CONFLICT I'VE LEARNED
IT TAKES THREE KEYS IN ORDER TO DO THAT
I DON'T WANT THAT
AS LULLABY HAS EVOLVED IT'S ALSO BROADENED OUT AND THE FIRST LULLABY THAT YOU'LL HEAR IS CALLED
HOW DO WE SERVE PEOPLE THROUGH MUSIC
WE WONDERED WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IF THESE YOUNG WOMEN WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COLLABORATE WITH ARTISTS
HE WAS STAFFING A LULLABY PROJECT WORKING WITH SOME YOUNG WOMEN WHO WERE
WE BELIEVE THAT MUSIC IS A BIRTH RIGHT AND THAT EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO EXTRAORDINARY MUSICAL
LULLABY HAS EVOLVED AND NOW TAKES PLACE IN NUMEROUS HEALTHCARE SETTINGS
WE WERE IN A ROOM WITH DOCTORS AND NURSES AND STAFF FROM JACOBI SOME OF OUR
AND SHE SAID THAT THESE YOUNG WOMEN WERE NOT REALLY READY TO HAVE CHILDREN AND IN ADDITION TO THAT THEY
WE STARTED TO WONDER ABOUT LULLABIES
WHAT FACTORS AND WHAT MOUNTS ARE NEEDED TO GUIDE AND REGENERATE NEURAL STEM CELLS
IF YOU NOTICED YOU HAVE THEM MAYBE WHEN YOU'RE SWIMMING DOING LAPS
I HELP LEADERS AND MANAGERS IN MOSTLY LARGE ORGANIZATIONS MAKE BETTER
THERE'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF RESEARCH IN THERE QUITE SURPRISING HOW LIMITED IT IS
I HAD DINNER LAST WEEK WITH ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF THE MINDFULNESS MOVEMENT VERY IMPORTANT FIGURE DANIEL SIEGEL AND HE WAS
ONE THING I DISCOVERED IS GREAT IDEAS DON'T SPREAD BY THEMSELVES QUITE OFTEN THEY NEED A
WELL IT'S NOT THE WATER BUT MANY PEOPLE MAKE THIS FALSE CORRELATION AND MANY OTHER FALSE
YOU KNOW HOW THAT IS
REAPPRAISAL FOR EXAMPLE MIGHT BE YOU'RE HAVING AN ARGUMENT WITH SOMEONE AND YOU ACTUALLY MANAGE TO SEE THE SITUATION
WHAT HAPPENS IN ORGANIZATIONS IS MANY MANAGERS ACCIDENTALLY DO ALL THE WRONG THINGS THEY TELL PEOPLE WHAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING
BUT WE'VE HARDLY MADE ANY IMPROVEMENTS IN HOW WE RELATE TO EACH OTHER IN 30 50 100 YEARS
I WAS IN CHICAGO LAST WEEK TALKING TO SOMEONE FROM A LARGE ORGANIZATION AND SHE WAS KIND OF LAUGHING AT HERSELF AND I
IT'S QUITE SURPRISING
THE THIRD THING IS WHEN YOU SUPPRESS EMOTIONS OTHER PEOPLE'S BLOOD PRESSURE GOES UP
IT ACTUALLY CREATES A THREAT RESPONSE IN OTHER PEOPLE WHICH IS QUITE SURPRISING
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
CASE IN POINT BEING
IT'S A DELIGHT TO BE HERE I THINK THESE EVENTS ARE VERY IMPORTANT
TEACHING PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR BRAIN MADE THEM FAR MORE EFFECTIVE AT WHATEVER THEY WANTED TO ACHIEVE
I WAS VERY SURPRISED BY THAT IT WASN'T WHERE I'D EXPECTED I WOULD END UP
AND I THINK IT'S TIME TO PUT SOME FOCUS ON THAT AND REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE THERE
THINK ABOUT IT
AND DOPAMINE IS GENERATED WHICH GIVES US A LITTLE HIGH AND IT KILLS PAIN
THAT WAS THE MAGIC NUMBER
THIS IS UNLIKE THE REST OF THE DEVELOPED WORLD WHERE AS GEORGE BURNS QUIPPED HAPPINESS IS HAVING A LARGE LOVING
IT'S A REMOTE MOUNTAINOUS ZONE A BLUE ZONE WHERE SUPER LONGEVITY IS COMMON TO BOTH
WELL THE SHORT ANSWER TO THE QUESTION IS NO IT'S NOT THE SAME THING
WE'LL CALL THIS THE SEVEN MINUTE PRINCIPLE
AS I SAID ABOUT A YEAR AGO I STARTED REALIZING THAT I NEEDED TO MAKE A CHANGE
SO THERE'S REALLY NO PROBLEM IF WE HAD A NEW TOOL
WHO HAS SET A GOAL OF 2030 TO ELIMINATE MALARIA FROM 35 COUNTRIES
AND MY COLLEAGUES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT IF YOU JUST PUT TWO OR THREE POSITIONS WHERE MOSQUITOES CAN GO PICK UP THESE LETHAL
THAT'S 2555 INFECTIOUS BITES EVERY YEAR
BUT THAT'S OK
WHY HAVE YOU TAKEN OUR APPLE
CHRISTMAS IS COMING WE MIGHT AS WELL BUY A LOT OF GIFTS FOR EVERYONE WE KNOW
ONE PERCENT CHECK THE BOX
IT'S A PROGRAM THAT RICHARD THALER FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO AND I DEVISED MAYBE
WE KNOW WE SHOULD BE SAVING
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE INTERESTING EVEN FOR THE MANY LONG TIME COLLECTORS HERE WITH US AT TED LOCAL COLLECTORS
BUT I CAN ONLY HOPE I'VE WHET YOUR APPETITE TO GO OUT AND SEE AND LEARN MORE ABOUT THE AMAZING THINGS THAT ARE
TO BUILD THE STORY OF THE 1 CLUB I DREW PARALLELS BETWEEN THE LANGUAGE OF THE TYPE 1 DIABETES
I HOPE TYPE 1 DIABETICS WALK AWAY REMEMBERING ONE SIMPLE THING
BUT I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE WRONG
AND THIS LED ME TO AN INCREDIBLE PLACE
THEY ARE THE FOUNDING FATHERS OF THE 1 CLUB
THE FIRST ANSWER TO THIS CAME FROM OBSERVING HOW TYPE 1 DIABETICS USE LANGUAGE
AS MY SUPPORT SYSTEMS SLIPPED AWAY I REALIZED THAT MY DISEASE HAD SLOWLY BECOME
THIS CONTRADICTED MY REALITY
THIS NOTION OF FRIENDSHIP OF COMMUNITY WENT AGAINST WHAT I BELIEVED TO BE GOOD DIABETES
WE NOW HAVE A GREAT CLINICAL GUIDANCE OUT ON THE NET
AND THEN WE REALIZED THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY A MIRROR IMAGE OF THE REAL AORTA
WE DON'T NEED ANY OF THAT
WE HAD TO GET GOOD QUALITY IMAGES FROM WHICH TO MAKE THE CAD MODEL
AND WE HAD TO GET PAST THE NICE PROBLEM
I SUPPOSE THE FUNDING BUREAUCRATS ULTIMATELY HAVE TO GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER
BECAUSE HE IS SO SUCCESSFUL
IN THE UK WE HAVE THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE AND CLINICAL EXCELLENCE
SO IT REALLY IS GREAT
FOUR AND A HALF HOURS ON THE TABLE AND EVERYTHING WAS DONE
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE MEDIA'S SPACE EXPANDS
THEY NEEDED OPENNESS
BUT THE OTHER THING THEY NEEDED WAS SPEED
IT'S JUST A FACT OF LIFE
SO MAYBE CREATING AN IMPACT CRATER IN THIS REGION IS A LOT LIKE MAKING A FOOTPRINT IN THE COLORADO SNOW
YOU CAN SEE WHY THE BUBBLE IS IMPORTANT
GAY LESBIAN BI TRANSGENDER OR STRAIGHT WE NEED YOU TO GO ALL OUT TO BUILD THIS HISTORIC MOVEMENT FOR
GLOBALGIVING THEY COME REGULARLY TO INDIA AS WELL CONDUCTING WORKSHOPS
WILL YOU JOIN US
AGAIN WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN TERMS OF HOW INFORMATION IS BEING CURTAILED IN WAYS THAT A LOT OF US
AND THIS IS SOMETHING YOU SHOULD CHECK OUT
IMAGINE A WORLD WITHOUT FREE KNOWLEDGE
EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN EGYPT THE REVOLUTION IN EGYPT
WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW ABOUT IS THIS WEBSITE
FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE REALLY INTERESTING THINGS THAT SHE DOES OR SHE USED TO DO THROUGH THE BLOG IS HIGHLIGHT CASES WHERE
AND I BELIEVE THAT THESE THREE PRINCIPLES CAN BE APPLIED TO SOLVING SOME OF THE VERY TOUGH PROBLEMS THAT WE
AND IF YOU CLOSED YOUR EYES YOU'D BE ABLE TO MENTALLY NAVIGATE IT
NO POWERPOINT IS USED IN TWO DAYS
BUT INSTEAD THE ENTIRE TEAM CREATES A SHARED MENTAL MODEL THAT THEY CAN ALL AGREE ON AND MOVE
YOU'RE NOT VERY COOL ARE YOU
A HUNDRED YEARS AGO THE FIRST FORESTER OF THE COMMONWEALTH ROTHROCK WROTE ABOUT THE PENNSYLVANIA DESERT
BUT WE HIT THE CRISIS IN A WORLD WHERE WE MIGHT HAVE COMMITTED OURSELVES TO ENOUGH SEA LEVEL RISE TO DISAPPEAR OUT OF THAT
WHAT IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF STRESS IN YOUR LIFE
NO ONE HAD EVER DONE IT
TWO WAYS TWO TONS
WE CAN BEGIN TO STUDY THE DYNAMIC RESPONSE OF THE BODY TO A DRUG
YOU WON'T FIND MANY CLINICAL TRIALS IN WHICH CHILDREN ARE INVOLVED YET EVERY DAY WE GIVE
THIS IS A DISEASE THAT AFFECTS A LARGE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS
TENDS TO BE MIDDLE AGED TENDS TO BE FEMALE
FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER I WAS ON MY WAY TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM WITH A FULL BLOWN ASTHMA ATTACK
I TOOK SOME ADVIL
CHILDREN ARE NOT ADULTS

THEY'VE EVEN TRIED TO GROW LITTLE MINI ORGANS IN THE LAB
WHEN THEY GET DAMAGED SAY BY CIGARETTE SMOKE FOR EXAMPLE THEY DON'T WORK PROPERLY AND THEY
A GARDEN PLOT THAT HE HAD PLANTED THAT HE HAD TAKEN CARE OF AND AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS LEARNING BOTANY AND
WELL WE FOUND OUT THAT IT WASN'T WORKING
IT WAS REALLY FRUSTRATING FOR HIM
EVERBODY WOULD START AT THE SAME TIME AND THEY'D END AT THE SAME TIME
THEY LOOK LIKE THEY'RE HAVING FUN
AND THERE ARE LEARNING HIGH LEVEL COMPUTER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES
I BROKE IT AGAIN I GOT TO RESTORE IT
BECAUSE NO ONE CHILD CAN MOVE A 6 FOOT LONG LINCOLN LOG
AND WE KNOW WHEN YOU THINK BACK TO YOUR EXPERIENCES AS A CHILD THAT IT IS THOSE EARLY RELATIONSHIPS WITH THOSE
AND THESE ARE ALL USING TECHNOLOGIES THAT EXIST NOW
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PLANET IN THE AMAZON WE'VE GOT MANY TRIBES WHICH PRACTICE WHAT
BUT THAT'S JUST AN EXAMPLE
AND I'M NOT SAYING THERE WAS NO PAIR BONDING GOING ON
NONVIOLENCE IS A CHOICE LIKE VEGETARIANISM BUT IT'S NOT WHO YOU ARE
WE HAVE APPETITES
SO THIS IS MY POINT
ALL CACILDA AND I HAVE DONE IS EXTEND THIS SHARING BEHAVIOR TO SEXUALITY
YOU'VE KNOWN THESE PEOPLE YOUR ENTIRE LIFE
I'M NOT SAYING THAT THEY DIDN'T LOVE THE PEOPLE THEY WERE HAVING SEX WITH
HOW'S THAT POSSIBLE
AUTHOR JULIA CAMERON WHO WROTE THE ARTIST'S WAY
RIGHT NOW WE FOCUS ON TOP DOWN
COULD WE COLLABORATE WITH WOMEN JOURNALISTS WITHOUT CHAINS AND NOT GET CO OPTED INTO
WE DID CAPACITY BUILDING
THERE WAS A MAN IN THE NETHERLANDS WHO DESCRIBED HOW HE WAS DATE RAPED ON A VISIT TO LONDON AND WASN'T TAKEN SERIOUSLY BY ANYONE HE REPORTED HIS CASE
I'M SURE I WILL
MY COMMUNITY WILL NOT FEEL WE ARE UNSAFE WALKING HOME AFTER DARK
I'VE BEEN INSPIRED BY MANY AND I HOPE I CAN BE AS STRONG AS THEM SOMEDAY
IT'S STILL AN ISSUE MANY PEOPLE BLAME VICTIMS FOR
BUT I DO WANT TO ENCOURAGE A MORE CONSIDERED APPROACH TO THE WAY WE USE IT TO RESPOND TO INJUSTICE
BUT I DON'T WANT TO DISCOURAGE A SOCIAL MEDIA RESPONSE BECAUSE I OWE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NOTGUILTY CAMPAIGN ALMOST
WITH US THIS WAS HOLDING MY ATTACKER TO ACCOUNT AND MANY OTHERS
BUT IN THIS WAY WE CAN BEGIN TO USE SOCIAL MEDIA AS AN ACTIVE TOOL FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AS A TOOL TO EDUCATE TO STIMULATE
SOMEONE HAD HURT ME AND THOSE WHO I LOVED UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO BE HELD TO ACCOUNT OR RECOGNIZE THE DAMAGE THEY HAD CAUSED
BEFORE I HAD TIME TO PROCESS WHAT WAS HAPPENING A HAND WAS CLAPPED AROUND MY MOUTH SO THAT I COULD NOT BREATHE AND THE
BUT IT'S AS IF BECAUSE THEY MIGHT BE BEHIND A SCREEN IN THE COMFORT IN THEIR OWN HOME WHEN ON SOCIAL MEDIA PEOPLE FORGET THAT WHAT THEY'RE
I'D READ NEWS REPORTS STATISTICS AND KNEW HOW COMMON SEXUAL ASSAULT WAS YET I COULDN'T ACTUALLY NAME A SINGLE PERSON THAT I'D HEARD
NOW THERE ARE FEW WORDS TO DESCRIBE THE ALL CONSUMING FEELINGS OF VULNERABILITY SHAME UPSET AND INJUSTICE THAT I WAS
I DON'T KNOW WHO THE PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE ARE
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOU
DIVISIVE TWITTER TROLLS WERE QUICK TO CREATE EVEN MORE INJUSTICE COMMENTING ON MY ATTACKER'S ETHNICITY OR
WELL OK NOW I WANT TO BECOME AN ARCHITECT
THE BUILDING THERE
THIS WAY YOU ARE IN CHARGE OF WHERE YOU'RE GETTING INFORMATION AS OPPOSED TO BEING
FOR EXAMPLE A STUDY BY HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL THAT SAID THAT CONSULTANTS KNOWLEDGE
WELL WE LIVE IN THE ECONOMY THAT IS BASED ON DISTRACTION
BECAUSE YOUR BRAIN STILL NEEDS THE EXCITEMENT OF DOPAMINE
WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH ALL THIS FREE TIME THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU WILL HAVE AVAILABLE
WE NEED TO GIVE UP ON THE IDEA THAT WE HAVE TO BE CONNECTED OR ACCESSIBLE 24 7
YOU FEEL GREAT
I CERTAINLY LEARNED IT TWICE
THE FIRST TIME WHEN IT TOOK ME FIVE MONTHS FROM THE DECISION OF
AND PARALLEL UNIVERSES
AND IT'S ONLY WHEN AN EXPLANATION IS GOOD THAT IT EVEN MATTERS WHETHER IT'S TESTABLE
SO WE PERCEIVE NOTHING AS WHAT IT REALLY IS
SO I'LL TELL YOU
THEY WISHED THEY KNEW HOW TO PREVENT THEIR FOOD SUPPLY FROM SOMETIMES
YOU HAVE YOUR INTERPRETATION
AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT YOU HAVE A STEADY STREAM OF VISITORS AND VOLUNTEERS COMING IN SHOWERING YOU IN THE
WHERE ARE THE KEYS TO MY FUTURE
ADEQUATE HOUSING PERMANENT SOLUTIONS NOT TEMPORARY LIKE SHELTERS INDEPENDENT
WHY DID YOU DO IT ONCE
THERE'S OVER 1
GOT A GREAT EXAMPLE FOR YOU
TELL ME WHAT ARE THEY WAITING FOR
WE HAVE NOW HELD PEACE MASK PROJECT WORKSHOPS IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD INCLUDING
WE WITNESSED KILOMETER AFTER KILOMETER OF TOWNS AND VILLAGES FLATTENED ALONG THE
WOULDN'T IT BE COOL TO BE ABLE TO LOOK INSIDE THE ANKLE TO SEE WHERE THIS RESTRICTION COMES
IN PROGRAMMING IN EARSKETCH WE OFTEN USE DATA STRUCTURES AS WAYS OF HOLDING COLLECTIONS OF
THAT MEANS PROGRAMMING THEM
CHORUS CHORUS VERSE ETC
SO THE BIGGEST EFFECT THAT WE'VE SEEN HAS BEEN FOR WOMEN AFRICAN AMERICANS AND LATINOS
IF WE STOP DEFINING EACH OTHER BY WHAT WE'RE NOT AND START DEFINING OURSELVES BY WHAT WE ARE WE CAN BE
BY DEFINITION THIS IS NOT WHAT FEMINISM IS
MANY OF MY MALES FRIENDS EXPRESS THAT THEY HAVE TO BE MASCULINE AND NOT SHOW EMOTION IN ORDER TO BE ACCEPTED
WE NEED TO THINK BEYOND HORIZONS REGARDING GENDER AND GENDER EQUALITY
I AM FROM NORWAY AND HERE I HAVE SEEN MY FATHER'S ROLE AS A PARENT BEING VALUED LESS BY SOCIETY
MEN FACE DISCRIMINATION TOO
BOTH MEN AND WOMEN SUFFER FROM GENDER STEREOTYPES AND GENDER ROLES AND THIS IS VERY EASY TO FORGET
LIKEWISE GENDER BASED STEREOTYPES AFFECT MEN TOO
I AM ALSO AN AUTHOR
SO I'VE WRITTEN SEVERAL BOOKS
IT WASN'T THE POINT
IT JUST TAKES ALL OF SOME OF US
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU
IT CAN'T BE INTEGRATED
PEOPLE YOU DON'T KNOW COME IN AND LOOK AT YOU AND POKE YOU AND PROD YOU AND WHEN I TELL CANCER SURVIVORS
IT'S TO BE NAKED DIGITALLY IN PUBLIC
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE POLITICS OF HEALTH CARE I'M TALKING ABOUT THE WAY WE SCIENTIFICALLY APPROACH HEALTH CARE
WHEN I GOT THESE RESULTS I STARTED TALKING TO DOCTORS AND THEY TOLD ME NOT TO TELL ANYONE AND MY REACTION IS IS THAT GOING TO HELP
IT'S NOT THE MOST SCIENCE POSITIVE STATE
IT CANNOT BE USED BY PEOPLE WHO AREN'T CREDENTIALED
HE HAD THIS HYPOTHESIS AND HE TESTED IT IN PEOPLE
WE JUST HAVE BETTER STATISTICS
IT CAN'T BE NETWORKED
ONCE WE ACCEPT THIS REALITY WE'LL REALIZE HOW CRUCIAL IT IS THAT WE CONTINUE TO EXPLORE WAYS
AND THAT'S GREAT BECAUSE MANURE IS A FANTASTIC ORGANIC FERTILIZER
NOW COMPOSTING IS JUST A LITTLE BIT LIKE BAKING
NOW SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO DRINK THAT
AND MAYBE ONE DAY WE WILL BE ABLE TO BUILD UP SOIL FERTILITY TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT WE MAY
AND WHEN BROUGHT OUT TO THE FIELD THAT MANURE SEEPS INTO OUR GROUNDWATER AND RIVERS AND CAUSES
EARTHWORMS THAT ARE THE BACKBONE OF A HEALTHY FERTILE SOIL COME RUSHING TO THE SURFACE
IN THIS FORM ALL OF THE NUTRIENTS ARE LOCKED UP SAFELY NONE OF THEM
WHEN WE EUROPEANS WERE STILL TAKING A DUMP IN OUR BACKYARDS AND DYING OF THE PLAGUE
NOW LET ME QUICKLY EXPLAIN TO YOU HOW THAT HAPPENS AND HOW THAT IS GOING TO HELP SAVE OUR
COWS GOATS AND SHEEP MAY UNLOCK THIS ABUNDANT RESOURCE TO US AND
SO I HAVE A VISION FOR A WORLD WHERE COWS ONLY EAT
A WHOLE ARMY OF MICROORGANISMS STARTS TO TAKE APART ALL THAT ORGANIC
SO I THOUGHT
I ENDED UP GETTING AN INVITATION TO GIVE A PITCH AT THE ANNUAL MEETING OF THE SWISS
I WENT TO WORK ON AN ORGANIC FARM CLOSE TO BERN AND THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT
THIS IS BUT ONE OF MANY ASPECTS OF HOW OUR INDUSTRIALIZED AGRICULTURE TODAY
INSTEAD ONLY EAT MEAT AND CHEESE FROM COWS THAT WERE FED ON
AND IN FACT AMMONIA CAUSES ACID RAIN
I IMAGINE A WORLD WERE EVERY FARMER COMPOSTS HIS MANURE WITH
A LIFE BASED ON EXPERIENCES INSTEAD OF THINGS
I HAD ABOUT TEN WOODEN SPOONS UNTIL I REALIZED THAT I ONLY HAVE TWO HANDS
THEY TELL US THAT FOR EACH APPLICATION WE NEED A DIFFERENT PRODUCT
THEY KEEP THE OTHER 80 FOR THE WHAT IF
BUT THESE ARE THE DREAMERS THE THINKERS I THINK WE NEED FOR SOCIETY TO PROGRESS
ESPECIALLY ON YOUR OWN
SO LET'S BEGIN RIGHT NOW
BY HAVING A SO CALLED UNREACHABLE DREAM WE CAN WORK TO CREATE A BETTER SOCIETY IT ASSISTS US IN
HOW CAN WE DREAM BIG WHEN WE CAN ONLY DREAM FOR THE SPECIFIC THING VISIBLE TO US
A TRUE DREAM IS NOT MEASURABLE
SOMETIMES THEY DON'T EVEN SEEM ATTAINABLE
SO TO BEGIN WITH FOCAL GLOW
AND YOU CAN IMAGINE A LOT MORE APPLICATIONS
THE PROBLEM IS THOUGH THAT I WANTED TO EXPLAIN TO YOU HOW THIS REALLY WORKS BUT I CAN HAVE FOUR OF THESE ON MY FINGER
WHAT IS YOUR SELF WORTH
SO NOW IF YOUR BAROMETER IS TELLING YOU THAT THINGS JUST AREN'T QUITE RIGHT THAT SOMETHING IS NOT QUITE
HE IS DANCING WITH HIS SHIRT OFF IN A CITY THAT I HAVE NEVER BEEN TO CLICK
I KNOW THAT ALLEY
JOHANN SEBASTIAN BACH ONLY HAD 24 HOURS
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO RECOGNIZE AN OPPORTUNITY YOU COULD LEVERAGE OR YOU COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
WRITE IT DOWN
IT'S NOT ABOUT A NEW ELEGANT PLANNER
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO BE INSPIRED
OUTCOME AND ACTION
THERE IS NO PERFECTION
YOU HAVE MONEY
ZEROS AND ONES OF PRODUCTIVE BEHAVIOR
YOU WILL FEEL EXPONENTIALLY MORE APPROPRIATELY ENGAGED WITH YOUR WORLD
WHAT DOES IT DO
YOU NOW GET TO EXPERIENCE ALL THE STUFF THAT YOU WOULD COULD SHOULD NEED TO MIGHT OUGHT TO ALL THE STUFF PILING UP IN YOUR IN BASKETS AND
EVERY SINGLE THING SEEMS TO DEMAND EQUAL KIND OF ATTENTION FROM YOU
SO MY WISH FOR ALL OF YOU IS FOR ALL OF THOSE ADVENTURES COMING TOWARDS YOU AND THEY'RE COMING TOWARDS YOU IN ORDER TO TAKE
IT'S NOT ABOUT A NEW PIECE OF SOFTWARE
AND MAYBE YOU HAD THIS SENSE OF THAT PEACE
WOULDN'T IT BE NICE BY THE WAY IF YOU COULD EXPERIENCE THAT KIND OF PEACE THAT KIND OF PRODUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT WITHOUT HAVING THE DANGER OR STRESS
IT'S ONLY ON YOUR MIND BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE'S STILL SOME THINKING OR SOME DECISIONS ABOUT THAT YOU HAVEN'T MADE OR YOU HAVEN'T PARKED THE RESULTS
WHAT'S MY JOB
YOU'RE LAUGHING BECAUSE IT'S TRUE
I REALISED IT WAS THE SINGLE BEST THING THEY COULD HAVE EVER DONE FOR ME
BUT WHAT SNAPPED ME BACK TO REALITY WAS HEARING MY SON BEHIND ME SAY I SURE WISH I HAD A PHONE SO I COULD
PETER DRUCKER FAMED LEADERSHIP GURU SAID BANKING AND FINANCE INDUSTRIES TODAY ARE LESS ABOUT MONEY AND MORE ABOUT INFORMATION
I RESENTED MY PARENTS FOR A YEAR
IN FACT IF EVER YOU'RE IN A LINE AND SOMEONE IN FRONT PULLS OUT THEIR CHEQUEBOOK TO PAY YOU ARE LIABLE TO SAY TO
AND IN MY SIMPLISTIC VIEW IT IS THIS
I MET AN AMERICAN NAMED JOS
MY 9 YEAR OLD SON IS ALWAYS THE CAR A VERY STRATEGIC PLAYER
TO WHICH THEY'D SAY DAD IT'S FINE
SHE WAS THE FIRST ONE BANKRUPTED
IN THE CONFINES OF MY EXPERIMENT THERE IS AN IDEA WORTH SPREADING AND IT IS THIS
SO WE DEVELOPED AN IDEA A RATIONALE THAT PERHAPS IF WE MADE A MOLECULE THAT PREVENTED THE POST IT
YET THIS INFORMATION IS LARGELY A SECRET
THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS THERE'S NO MOUSE MODEL OF THIS RARE CANCER
AND THE VERY UNSATISFYING YET SCIENTIFIC ANSWER IS
WE THOUGHT WE'D JUST SEND IT TO PEOPLE AND SEE HOW THE MOLECULE BEHAVES
THIS RESEARCH IS FUNDED BY THE PUBLIC
THE FIRST IS
WE DON'T HAVE A TEAM OF SALESPEOPLE AND MARKETEERS TO TELL US HOW TO POSITION THIS DRUG AGAINST THE OTHER
AND ONE THING I'VE LEARNED IN BOSTON IS THAT YOU PEOPLE WILL DO ANYTHING FOR CANCER AND I LOVE THAT
WELL THEY PROBABLY WOULD KEEP THIS A SECRET UNTIL THEY TURN THE PROTOTYPE DRUG INTO AN ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL
AND WE'RE ABLE FINALLY TO ANSWER THE QUESTION THAT'S BEEN SO PRESSING FOR SO MANY YEARS
IT'S TOO HARD
WHY DO I HAVE CANCER
YET COMPARATIVELY WE HAVE ABOUT A DOZEN TARGETED MEDICATIONS
WHY IS THAT
WELL WE HAD DATA THAT TOLD A DIFFERENT STORY
FOR MANY MUSLIM WOMEN THE HIJAB IS AN INTERNAL MESSAGE TO THEMSELVES AND MORE
OF COURSE WE NEED TO CONDEMN THE COMPULSORY VEILING OF WOMEN WHEREVER IT
BUT WHERE WOMEN DO HAVE A CHOICE WE NEED TO RESPECT THAT THEY WILL EXERCISE THAT
THE FOLLOWING DAY WOMEN DIDN'T GO TO WORK
AND 100 000 OF THEM POURED INTO THE STREETS OF TEHRAN MARCHING
I HEARD SOMEBODY
AND WE WONDER WHY THEY CAN'T THINK OUTSIDE OF IT
MUFASA SAYS YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN YOURSELF THEREFORE YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN ME
WHY IS THAT
THE FIRST E IS ENVIRONMENT
SO LET'S DO THIS I'M GOING TO TAKE A DOG THAT COMES FROM WHERE I COME FROM ON ST
OUR YOUNG PEOPLE LIVE IN A BOX
I'D WRITTEN FOR MY EMPLOYER THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY ON A RANGE OF TOPICS WORK MONEY
ALMOST LIKE THEY WERE DISCOVERING SEX FOR THE FIRST TIME
BUT DON'T WORRY WORLD
FAST FORWARD TO 1900 WE'RE IN THE U
IT'S BECAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME A WOMAN IS TELLING IT
FINALLY IN THESE WOMEN'S LIVES THEY HAD THEIR OWN MONEY THEIR OWN PLACES
NARRATORS MAYBE WE DIDN'T ALWAYS COME UP WITH OURSELVES
AND THEN I REALIZED YOU KNOW TO TRULY CELEBRATE MENOPAUSE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CHALLENGE AND
IT'S TIME FOR A CHANGE
UNLIKE MALES FEMALES CAN MAKE BABIES AND THEN STOP MAKING THEM BUT LIVE SEVERAL
THE WISDOM OF MENOPAUSE
SO THE OLD NARRATIVE ABOUT MENOPAUSE WAS THAT MENOPAUSE IS THE CHANGE RIGHT
THE AVERAGE LIFESPAN OF A U
ALMOST ONE IN TWO
THANK YOU FOR THAT
BECAUSE FROM THE ANCIENT GREEKS ON IT WAS MOSTLY MEN WHO WROTE ABOUT IT
YOU CAN ANSWER THAT ONE PRETTY READILY AT LEAST FOR MOST PEOPLE
SO I BECAME MUCH MORE TOLERANT OF THE VAST WORLD OF ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS
AND SO WE HAVE AN EPIDEMIC IN THIS COUNTRY OF DEPRESSION AMONG IMPOVERISHED PEOPLE
I'M CRYING NOW AS I WRITE TO YOU
THINGS ARE DIFFERENT BECAUSE NOW I KNOW THAT DEPRESSION IS THE FAMILY SECRET THAT EVERYONE
AND SHE SAID IT JUST IS TOO FAR FETCHED
HE WAS WHEN I MET HIM AT A POINT AT WHICH EVERY MONTH HE WOULD HAVE ELECTROSHOCK TREATMENT
SO FRANK RUSSAKOFF SAID TO ME IF I HAD A DO OVER I SUPPOSE I WOULDN'T DO IT THIS WAY BUT IN A
THEY DIDN'T EXTERNALIZE THE DEPRESSION AS AN INVASIVE SPIRIT
HE'S NOW A FRIEND OF MINE
PEOPLE WILL SAY NO ONE LOVES ME
AND HE HAD THE CINGULOTOMY AND IT WAS INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL
THE DEPRESSIVE GROUP WAS USUALLY ACCURATE TO WITHIN ABOUT 10 PERCENT AND THE NON DEPRESSED PEOPLE GUESSED
SOMEONE WAS ASKING ME BACKSTAGE TODAY ABOUT MEDITATION
AND I WENT OUT AND I INTERVIEWED PERSON AFTER PERSON WHO WAS SUFFERING WITH DEPRESSION
AND I SAID WHY NOT
AND I SAID YES THAT'S FINE
THAT HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON WITH WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING
THEN HE WOULD FEEL SORT OF DISORIENTED FOR A WEEK
I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY TO MY CHILDREN
THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT I FEEL SAD ABOUT NOW
AND THEN HE WOULD HAVE ANOTHER ELECTROSHOCK TREATMENT
THERE IS THIS FALSE MORAL IMPERATIVE THAT SEEMS TO BE ALL AROUND US THAT TREATMENT OF
AND SO I WENT OUT TO TRY TO LOOK AT WHAT WAS BEING DONE FOR POOR PEOPLE WITH DEPRESSION
IT'S JUST TOO IMPLAUSIBLE
AND YET IT TURNS OUT THAT IF YOU HAVE A REALLY LOVELY LIFE BUT FEEL MISERABLE ALL THE TIME YOU THINK WHY DO I FEEL
AND I GET LETTERS I GET HUNDREDS OF LETTERS FROM PEOPLE WRITING TO TELL ME ABOUT WHAT'S WORKED FOR THEM
AND WHAT I CAME UP WITH OVER TIME WAS THAT THE PEOPLE WHO DENY THEIR EXPERIENCE AND SAY I WAS
WHAT ARE THE MECHANISMS THAT ALLOW PEOPLE TO SURVIVE
HE'S REALLY THE KIND OF GUY TO WHOM THIS WOULDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE SO YOU KNOW IT'S JUST BETWEEN US
AND SO I FOUND AN ACADEMIC WHO WAS DOING A RESEARCH PROJECT IN SLUMS OUTSIDE OF D
THEN HE WOULD HAVE A WEEK OF GOING DOWNHILL
AS I UNWRAPPED IT I BEGAN TO CRY AND MY MOTHER CAME OVER AND SAID ARE YOU CRYING BECAUSE OF
AND YOU SAY I LOVE YOU YOUR WIFE LOVES YOU YOUR MOTHER LOVES YOU
AND I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHICH IT WAS
YOU DON'T THINK IN DEPRESSION THAT YOU'VE PUT ON A GRAY VEIL AND ARE SEEING THE WORLD THROUGH THE HAZE
IS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS WHEN THAT SYSTEM GETS BROKEN
THOSE WHO CAN TOLERATE THEIR DEPRESSION ARE THE ONES WHO ACHIEVE RESILIENCE
I MUST HAVE DEPRESSION
AND THERE WERE OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAD WHAT SOUNDED AS THEY DESCRIBED IT LIKE TERRIBLY SEVERE DEPRESSION WHO
IT'S NOT THAT I'M SO SAD BUT I GET OVERWHELMED I THINK BECAUSE I COULD HAVE KILLED MYSELF BUT MY
WHAT IS THE MECHANISM OF RESILIENCE
THEN HE WOULD FEEL OKAY FOR A WEEK
I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN PHILADELPHIA P
I'M FROM PITTSBURGH PENNSYLVANIA
AND WE WERE VERY EXCITED
AND DON'T JUST BUY THEM FOR YOUR DAUGHTERS BUY THEM FOR YOUR SONS
BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT BOYS PLAY WITH AND AS FEMALE SUPERHEROES JUST AS MY DAUGHTER
TAKE YOUR TIME
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT
DON'T LET US PUT PRESSURE ON YOU BECAUSE WE'RE FASTER THAN YOU
I TAKE THEM TO THE PARK
I PEDAL EVERY DAY
BIT BY BIT I'M MAKING IT HAPPEN
IT'S A SMALL WORD
YOU'VE GOT TO LEARN TO BE NIMBLE AND AGILE
SO I DO WHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE MYSELF FEEL HAPPY
IN FACT IT WAS MY FRIENDS AND MY FAMILY WHO TAUGHT ME A NEW SKILL
THERE IS NO TRY
I CALL IT RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW
AT NINE HIS MOTHER DIES
AT TEN HIS FATHER DIES
I SAID IT'S NINE MINUTES
IN A IN OUR ARSENAL AND THE YOUTH AND SELECTIVELY BASED ON THE GOALS AT THE WORKSHOP BY THE FEES ARE THE WORKSHOP
BUT SOMETHING CHANGED FOR ME WHEN I MET MY WIFE
THEY WERE LOOKING THE NEXT KARMAPA AND I NOTICED THEY WERE TALKING TO MY MOM AND
HOW DID THAT FEEL WHEN THEY CAME AND WHISKED YOU AWAY AND YOUR LIFESTYLE
AND IMMEDIATELY A LOT OF DIFFERENT RESPONSIBILITIES IN TERMS OF MY EDUCATION AND SO
AND YOU OBSERVE A REALLY STRANGE EFFECT
WE'RE TRYING TO PREVENT AN IMPACT
BUT IF YOU'RE AN ALIEN RACE WHO DOESN'T KNOW ANY OF THIS DOESN'T HAVE ANY CONCEPT OF EARTH INTELLIGENCE YOU'D BE
IN COSMOLOGY FOR EXAMPLE THERE HAVE BEEN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT THREADS OF EVIDENCE THAT
WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT
ARE YOU WILL TO LOVE AND ACCEPT
MONEY WAS NO PROBLEM
THEY HAVE THE SAME ACCESS TO THE SAME TALENT THE SAME AGENCIES THE SAME CONSULTANTS THE SAME MEDIA
THAT'S LIKE THAT GUT FEELING OH THEY JUST GET IT
IT'S ALWAYS A RESULT
HE WAS IN PURSUIT OF THE RICHES
IT JUST DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT
THAT'S HOW WE DESCRIBE THEM RIGHT
EVERYBODY WAS TRYING IT
IT'S WHAT THEY BELIEVED ABOUT AMERICA THAT GOT THEM TO TRAVEL IN A BUS FOR EIGHT HOURS TO STAND IN THE SUN IN
HE WANTED TO BE RICH AND HE WANTED TO BE FAMOUS
NOT PSYCHOLOGY BIOLOGY
THE BEST WE CAN MUSTER UP IS I DON'T KNOW
I BELIEVE I BELIEVE I BELIEVE HE TOLD PEOPLE
THAT'S HOW MOST OF US COMMUNICATE
AND IT'S THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE TO EVERYONE ELSE
AND BY WHY I DON'T MEAN TO MAKE A PROFIT
THAT'S A RESULT
AS WE SAID BEFORE THE RECIPE FOR SUCCESS IS MONEY AND THE RIGHT PEOPLE AND THE RIGHT MARKET CONDITIONS
THEY FOUND THAT IN EVERY METROPOLITAN AREA THEY WOULD CAPTURE OVER 20 MINUTES A DAY OF CLEARTEXT
AND SO THEY HAD A SIMPLE SETUP
DON'T WASTE COMPUTER CYCLES
FACEBOOK IS A DREAM PLACE FOR SPIES
YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH THE SPY IS HAPPY
NOW KEEP THAT IN MIND AND THINK ABOUT THE CHILDREN OF OUR GRANDCHILDREN
I WAS SITTING THERE IN THE AUDIENCE LISTENING TO HIM AND HE SAID ABOUT PRISM AND OTHER INTELLIGENCE GATHERING
WE HAVE TO DISRUPT
BUT EVENTUALLY I STARTED TO LOOK HUMAN AGAIN
SO I HAD TO GO THROUGH TRYING TO EAT AGAIN
I HAD NO IDEA THAT AT THAT MOMENT MY LIFE WAS GOING TO CHANGE FOREVER
SO I MOVED ON FROM THERE
I WAS WRAPPED IN ICE AND THEN EVENTUALLY PUT INTO A DRUG INDUCED COMA
I HAD MORE THAN 50 SURGERIES
WE'RE NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE HAIRSTYLES THEY TRIED TO FORCE ON ME ONCE MY HAIR GREW BACK
BUT ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THEY NEEDED TO DO WAS ASSESS WHAT I NEEDED RIGHT AWAY
SO THERE WERE ALL THESE SKILLS AND TALENTS THAT THESE SENIORS HAD
THEY WERE GOING TO MAKE IT FUN FOR ME
AND AS A BLIND PERSON YOUR VISUAL MEMORY FADES AND IS REPLACED WITH
I WOULDN'T BE STANDING HERE TODAY IF IT WASN'T FOR EXTREME RADICAL COLLABORATION
AND THEN THEY HAD TO FIGURE OUT WELL SHE NEEDS FURNITURE
AND I KNOW ALL OF YOU ARE SCRATCHING YOUR HEAD A SENIOR CITIZENS' HOME
WHAT IN THE WORLD ARE YOU GOING TO DO THERE
SO THERE WERE TWO OBSTACLES I HAD TO GET THROUGH
SOME THINGS WORKED SOME THINGS DIDN'T
I ENDED UP WITH BLUNT CHEST TRAUMA
YOUR AORTA COMES UP BEHIND YOUR HEART IT'S YOUR MAJOR ARTERY AND IT WAS SEVERED SO MY
SOMEHOW I ENDED UP AT THE HOSPITAL
BUT WHEN YOU'RE BLIND YOU HAVE THE TACTILE MEMORY FOR THINGS
TODAY I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU ON A VOYAGE TO SOME PLACE SO DEEP SO DARK SO
AND THIRD IS THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT OCEAN BASIN WIDE MANAGEMENT
AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT YOU ALSO NEED OCEAN BASIN MANAGEMENT REGIMES
THAT'S THE POINT OF REHABILITATION OR EDUCATION
SO THESE KINDS OF RESULTS REALLY MAKES TWO MAIN POINTS
THAT'S WHAT WE JUST DID
AND SO WE NEED AND WE'RE WORKING ON UNDERSTANDING WHAT ARE THOSE ACTIVE INGREDIENTS SO THAT WE CAN REALLY THEN
EVERYBODY BEGINS TO MOVE AROUND AND YOUR TASK IS TO KEEP TRACK OF WHO HAD A COAT AT THE
THAT WOULD BE A LITTLE COSTLY PROPOSITION
WHEN WE MEASURE THEM IN THE LAB THEY'RE REALLY BAD
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE PROGRAMMED TO DO
I TALK ABOUT FUTURES
ABOUT THREE SECONDS AGO
HE GOES I LOVE WHAT YOU DO
SOMEONE WITH THAT KIND OF HEART THERE'S SOME KIND OF CONNECTION THERE
SO WHAT'S THE BENEFIT
SO IF HUMANS EVOLVED AS RUNNERS IF THAT'S OUR ONE NATURAL ADVANTAGE THEN WHY ARE WE SO BAD AT IT
AGAIN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUTLIERS THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME KIND OF CAUSE AND EFFECT
YOU TAKE A RUNNER LIKE ANN TRASON OR NIKKI KIMBALL OR JENN SHELTON PUT THEM IN A RACE OF 50 OR 100 MILES
WELL HOW DO WE SPOIL ANYTHING
THE MAYANS AND AZTECS ENGAGED WHICH IS WHY THERE ARE VERY FEW MAYANS AND AZTECS
GERONIMO USED TO SAY MY ONLY FRIENDS ARE MY LEGS
THANKS VERY MUCH
WE HAVE OUR DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY
THEY CAN'T BE 10 MILES BEHIND
WELL I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU THE FIRST THING IS GET RID OF ALL PACKAGING ALL THE SALES ALL THE MARKETING
AUSTRALOPITHECUS HAD A TINY LITTLE PEA BRAIN
WE TALKED FOR TWO MINUTES BACKSTAGE AND SHE TALKED ABOUT PLANTAR FASCIITIS
AND YOU'LL GET SLOWER AND SLOWER UNTIL EVENTUALLY YOU'RE BACK TO RUNNING THE SAME SPEED YOU WERE AT AGE 19
MAYBE WE EVOLVED AS A HUNTING PACK ANIMAL
WE THINK USAIN BOLT IS FAST
AND IF WE FIND THAT THING MAYBE THERE IS A BIG FAT NOBEL PRIZE OUT THERE
SO HOW DO WE GET BACK TO THAT AGAIN
THE PACK STAYS TOGETHER
WINS THE NEW YORK CITY MARATHON GOES HOME WITH A BIG FAT CHECK
SO YOU BURN OFF THE H AGEN DAZS FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE
BUT MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT
STOP FOCUSING ON URBAN MARATHONS WHICH IF YOU DO FOUR HOURS YOU SUCK AND IF YOU DO
EVERY OTHER ANIMAL IS STRONGER THAN WE ARE THEY HAVE FANGS THEY HAVE CLAWS THEY HAVE NIMBLENESS THEY HAVE
NUMBER ONE IS THEY HAVE BEEN LIVING ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED FOR THE PAST 400 YEARS
THEY'RE TRYING TO SOLVE THOSE SAME KINDS OF MYSTERIES
MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING BETWEEN WHAT WE ARE TODAY AND WHAT THE TARAHUMARA HAVE ALWAYS BEEN
THEY ARE FREE FROM ALL OF THESE MODERN AILMENTS
THEY GIVE YOU 48 HOURS TO FINISH THIS RACE
THE SECOND THING REMARKABLE ABOUT THE TARAHUMARA IS DEEP INTO OLD AGE 70 TO 80 YEARS OLD
WE TRY TO CASH IN ON IT
THAT'S BECAUSE AN APACHE TRIATHLON USED TO BE YOU'D RUN 50 MILES ACROSS THE DESERT ENGAGE IN HAND TO HAND COMBAT
YOU NEED TO HAVE THOSE 64 AND 65 YEAR OLDS WHO HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A LONG TIME TO UNDERSTAND WHICH ANTELOPE YOU'RE TRYING TO
AND ONCE AGAIN A MYSTERY WRAPPED INSIDE OF A MYSTERY PERHAPS THE KEY TO DERARTU TULU AND THE
SO YOU HAVE THESE THREE MYSTERIES
AND WHAT YOU FIND IS SOMETHING THE TARAHUMARA HAVE KNOWN FOR A VERY LONG TIME THAT THIS CAN BE A WHOLE LOT OF FUN
A COUPLE YEARS AGO EMILY BAER SIGNED UP FOR A RACE CALLED THE HARDROCK 100 WHICH TELLS YOU ALL YOU NEED TO
SO WHAT IF WE EVOLVED AS HUNTING PACK ANIMALS
IN OTHER WORDS EARLY HUMANS ARE EATING DEAD ANIMALS NO ARGUMENT THAT'S A FACT
WE'RE REALLY GOOD AT BEING SWEATY AND SMELLY
FOR SOME REASON YOU GUYS ARE JUST REALLY SLOW
IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHY THE TARAHUMARA DON'T FIGHT AND DON'T DIE OF HEART DISEASE WHY A POOR ETHIOPIAN
WE TRY TO CAN IT AND PACKAGE IT AND MAKE IT BETTER AND THEN SELL IT TO PEOPLE
IT'S ONLY IN OUR LIFETIME THAT RUNNING HAS BECOME ASSOCIATED WITH FEAR AND PAIN
WHY YOU WERE BANNED FROM THE MARATHON BEFORE THE 1980S
WELL THERE ARE TEAMS OF SCIENTISTS AT HARVARD AND THE UNIVERSITY OF UTAH THAT ARE BENDING THEIR BRAINS AND TRYING TO FIGURE
YOU CAN'T BE A PISSED OFF PACK
WELL IF THAT'S TRUE A COUPLE OTHER THINGS HAD TO BE TRUE AS WELL
THE TARAHUMARA HAD A DIFFERENT STRATEGY
ALL OF OUR SCIENCE COMES FROM THE FACT THAT OUR ANCESTORS WERE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY EVERY DAY WHICH WAS
THEY TOOK OFF AND HID IN THIS LABYRINTHINE NETWORKING SPIDER WEBBING
THOSE EXPERT TRACKERS HAVE TO BE PART OF THE PACK
I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE
SHE'S 37 YEARS OLD
AND THEN AFTER THAT YOU SUCCUMB TO THE RIGORS OF TIME
YOU SHOW ME A CREATURE WITH WEBBED FEET AND GILLS SOMEHOW WATER'S INVOLVED
YOU KNOW WE LOOK AT RUNNING AS THIS KIND OF ALIEN FOREIGN THING THIS PUNISHMENT YOU'VE GOT TO DO BECAUSE YOU ATE PIZZA THE NIGHT BEFORE
NOW THIS IS WHEN SOMETHING REALLY BIZARRE HAPPENS
GET RID OF ALL THE STINKING RUNNING SHOES
AND WHAT THEY HAVE FOUND UNIFORMLY IS YOU GET RID OF THE SHOES YOU GET RID OF THE STRESS YOU GET RID OF THE
SO WE ALL KNOW WHAT TO DO IN THIS SITUATION RIGHT
WHAT I'VE BEEN SEEING TODAY IS THERE IS A GROWING SUBCULTURE OF BAREFOOT RUNNERS PEOPLE WHO'VE GOTTEN RID
HE PISSED ME OFF
BUT IT AIN'T DOING BOTH
IF YOU GO OUT BY YOURSELF AND TRY TO CHASE AN ANTELOPE I GUARANTEE THERE WILL BE TWO CADAVERS OUT IN THE SAVANNA
BUT MAYBE THERE'S ANOTHER BENEFIT THERE AS WELL
BUT THE COOL THING ABOUT RUNNING AS I'VE DISCOVERED IS THAT SOMETHING BIZARRE HAPPENS IN THIS ACTIVITY ALL THE TIME
THE FASTEST WOMAN TO EVER RUN A MILE DID IT IN 415
WE ARE HERE TODAY
WHAT IF THE ONLY NATURAL ADVANTAGE WE HAD IN THE WORLD WAS THE FACT THAT WE COULD GET TOGETHER AS A GROUP
TO HAVE A BRAIN OF THAT SIZE YOU NEED TO HAVE A SOURCE OF CONDENSED CALORIC ENERGY
SO MAYBE THAT S HOW ASTROLOGY GOT STARTED I DON T KNOW
THE QUESTION COMES UP
I M A GREETING CARD PUBLISHER
BUT SO I SPENT A WEEK TRYING TO GET MY BRAIN AROUND
GREETINGS TO ALL OF YOU FROM PAKISTAN
IT FELT LIKE IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT
WHY SHOULD WE DO THIS AS INDIANS AND PAKISTANIS
WE ARE BUT TWO THREADS CUT FROM THE SAME CLOTH
AND IF OUR FATES ARE INTERTWINED THEN WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS GOOD KARMA IT IS GOOD
AND HE IS FROM THE RED LAKE NATION
AT ONE TIME WOLVES OCCUPIED OVER 95 PERCENT OF THE NORTH AMERICAN LANDSCAPE
AND ONE DAY BOZO DID NOT COME BACK
AND I WAITED FOR HIM
I KNEW THAT I WAS GOING TO MAKE THIS FILM ABOUT WOLVES
BECAUSE THEY MAY TURN OUT TO BE A MAJORITY
AND THE PARADOX IS THAT THE DECADE BEFORE THE LAST DECADE WAS SO PROMISING
RIGHT NOW THE DISCUSSION GOES
HOW ARE WE GOING TO SOLVE CLIMATE CHANGE THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS UNLESS WE ARE ABLE TO MAKE CIVIL SOCIETY AND
STILL I THINK YOU'LL FIND THAT NORWAY IS A COUNTRY WITH A STRONG SOCIAL CAPITAL BASE WHICH I THINK IS
TO ME AND TO MY FAMILY
I THINK THAT IS WRONG
IT WAS BLACK OR WHITE
AND HE TOLD ME
WE DIDN'T GRASP WHAT WAS GOING ON
A FEW DAYS LATER WE WENT TO A BUDDHIST TEMPLE IN FOOTSCRAY AND SAT AROUND HER CASKET
SO I FOLLOWED MY HUNCHES
I KNEW SHE HAD COME TO SAY GOODBYE
WE TOLD HER STORIES AND ASSURED HER THAT WE WERE STILL WITH HER
MY MOTHER PHONED MINUTES LATER
IF WE WERE CAPTURED FIRST MY SISTER AND I THEN SHE AND MY GRANDMOTHER WOULD DRINK
AND FOR THAT WORK WHEN I WAS A FINAL YEAR LAW STUDENT I WAS CHOSEN AS THE YOUNG AUSTRALIAN OF THE YEAR
I LOOKED THROUGH THE SHOWER SCREEN AND SAW HER STANDING ON THE OTHER SIDE
YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY INTERACTS WITH PEOPLE
IT'S JUST IT'S DIFFICULT TO DESCRIBE THIS
EVERY MORNING I WAKE UP AND I LOOK AT ALL THE STUFF THAT GOOGLE ALERTS SENDS ME AND IT'S JUST AMAZING
ACTUALLY I KIND OF FELT BULLETPROOF BECAUSE I KNEW THAT I HAD BROKEN THE SPELL AND I HAD FOUND MY WAY BACK HOME TO
AND IT WAS ONLY WHEN I WAS TRYING TO UNTHREAD THAT THAT I FINALLY BEGAN TO COMPREHEND THE STRANGE AND UNLIKELY
SO THAT MIGHT BE CREATIVITY IT MIGHT BE FAMILY IT MIGHT BE INVENTION ADVENTURE FAITH SERVICE IT MIGHT BE RAISING
I WROTE ALL THROUGH CHILDHOOD ALL THROUGH ADOLESCENCE BY THE TIME I WAS A TEENAGER I WAS SENDING MY VERY BAD STORIES TO THE NEW
AND THAT'S HOW I PUSHED THROUGH IT
YOU GOT SOMETHING TO DO WITH THAT WHOLE EAT PRAY LOVE' THING THAT'S BEEN GOING ON LATELY
TURN OFF THOSE MOBILE PHONES
DO YOU NEED THAT MUCH OR DO YOU NEED MORE
BUT STRESS IS SO MUCH MORE
ESSENTIALLY SLEEP FRAGMENTS AND BECOMES LESS ROBUST BUT SLEEP REQUIREMENTS DO NOT GO DOWN
SIMPLE AS THAT
AND SO TIRED PEOPLE TEND TO HAVE HIGHER RATES OF OVERALL INFECTION AND THERE'S SOME VERY GOOD STUDIES SHOWING THAT SHIFT
IT'S FASHIONABLE AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE WHAT'S BEEN SHOWN IS THAT WITHIN THE BRAIN A WHOLE RAFT OF GENES HAVE BEEN
IF YOU COMPARE AN INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS SLEPT AT NIGHT OR STAYED AWAKE
THIS IS THE TIME TO BE AWAKE
SOME IS BOUGHT
HE SAID THEIR TRACKS WERE SLIGHTLY LARGER
BY COMBINING THE DATA INTO ONE LANDSCAPE IT'S EASIER TO INTEGRATE THE THREE TYPES OF DATA
SO NUMBER ONE
AND THIS BRINGS US TO NUMBER THREE
I'LL END ON WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT
THIS IS A RICH CAKE
THE PHYSICAL WORLD IS OUR FRAMEWORK FOR INTERPRETATION
VIRTUAL REALITY COULD CHANGE THIS
1275 PEOPLE RESPONDED TO THE SURVEY PROMPT WHAT IS A FAKE PIECE OF HAIR WORN
BUT I WONDER HOW MUCH WASTE DOES EACH PRODUCE
I LOOK IT UP
65 POUNDS OF MANURE IN ONE DAY
SHE WAS AFRAID SHE COULDN'T DO IT
DON'T LET THAT POSITIVITY END WITH YOU
SHE'D NEVER BEEN TO A CONVENTION BEFORE
SEE IT AS A CHALLENGE BECAUSE YOU CAN DO ANYTHING
SHE'D NEVER MADE A COSTUME
I'LL SHARE A STORY WITH YOU
WHAT I'VE JUST DESCRIBED TO YOU IS WHAT COSPLAY IS
THEY SIT DOWN AT THE PIANO AND THEY PLAY A SONG
THAT'S GREATER THAN ONE PERCENT OF THE GLOBAL GDP
AND THE CHALLENGE HAS LONG BEEN CAN WE HARNESS THE POWER THE UNDOUBTED POWER OF THESE STEM CELLS
AND ONE OF THE BOTTLENECKS IS EARLY IN DRUG DISCOVERY
TAKE A SKIN CELL MAKE IT A MASTER PLURIPOTENT CELL SO YOU COULD THEN MAKE THOSE CELLS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO THEIR
I DO BELIEVE THAT THE DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES LIKE STEM CELLS THAT I'VE TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO YOU DO OFFER VERY REAL HOPE
I DON'T THINK MYSELF THAT WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THAT THOSE STEM CELLS HAVE MADE NEW MYELIN OR NEW NERVES
SO THIS IS A PROOF OF CONCEPT
ALL THAT SCREENING OCCURS IN ANIMAL MODELS
I'VE TOLD YOU THESE DISEASES ARE TERRIBLE
WHERE'S THE HOPE
AND THAT IN PART REFLECTS THE COMPLEXITY OF DRUG DEVELOPMENT
THIS WAS THE BREAKTHROUGH
SO IT SEES A SMILE AS A SMILE
WE DID ABOUT 325 SHOTS
AND THE SAUCE WAS CODE IN SOFTWARE THAT WE'D WRITTEN TO ALLOW THESE DISPARATE PIECES OF TECHNOLOGY TO COME
SO THIS BECAME THE FOUNDATION OF OUR RESEARCH AS WE WENT FORWARD
IT'S SOMETHING YOU ENGAGE WITH
SO THIS IS THE TRUE CHALLENGE TO PUBLIC SPACE
IT'S OUR RIGHT
SO THAT'S THE SCIENCE BEHIND WHAT WE'RE DOING
WE CALL THIS PROJECT VOCALID OR VOCAL I
WHAT SHE CAN PRODUCE ARE MOSTLY VOWEL LIKE SOUNDS BUT THAT'S ENOUGH FOR US TO EXTRACT HER SOURCE
I WANT YOU TO TAKE A LISTEN TO HOW THEY SOUND
SO I REACHED OUT TO MY COLLABORATOR TIM BUNNELL
BUT I THOUGHT THERE HAD TO BE A WAY TO REVERSE ENGINEER A VOICE FROM WHATEVER
IT PULLS OUR TRIGGERS IN WAYS THAT MAKES US WANT TO EAT MORE
PEOPLE CAN'T REALLY MAKE HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP WITHOUT ACCESS TO A LABORATORY AND AN ADVANCED CHEMISTRY DEGREE
AND THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS SUGAR
AND ITS SURVIVAL DEPENDS ON PESTICIDES REFRIGERATION AND SEMI TRUCKS
AND WHAT MAKES A FOOD PROCESSED
I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN THAT I DEDICATED THE LAST CHAPTER OF MY BOOK TO THE ENDEAVOR OF EATING UNPROCESSED ON THE AMOUNT OF
THE SPINACH OF BREAKFAST CONFECTIONS
BUT I READ WHAT WE HAVE READ
YOU STOP AT THE STORE ON THE WAY HOME TO SEE IF THEY HAVE KALE
I AM AWARE THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE FOR WHOM 4 50C A MEAL IS SIMPLY UNAFFORDABLE
AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES SUGAR SO TRICKY
I REMEMBER STANDING IN THIS WAREHOUSE FULL OF MANGOES AND IT BEING INCONCEIVABLE TO ME HOW THIS MASS OF FRUIT MIGHT EVER
I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WHERE MY FOOD IS COMING FROM BECAUSE I KNOW WHERE IS COMING FROM
BUT THE PROBLEM WITH SUGAR IS THAT I'M NOT ALONE
AT THIS PARTICULAR WAREHOUSE DURING THEIR HIGH SEASON EVERY SINGLE DAY THEY MIGHT MOVE IN AND OUT
IT IS OVERWHELMING ALL OF THE CHOICES WE'RE FACED WITH TODAY
HOW YOUR BODY RESPONDS WHEN YOU DRINK A GLASS OF APPLE JUICE VERSUS EATING AN APPLE
PEOPLE CAN MAKE CORN INTO CORN TORTILLAS
IT IS IN FOR EXAMPLE IN THE BLUEBERRY FLAVORED FLAX SEEDS
ALL FOODS ARE PROCESSED AND OFTEN THEY ARE BETTER FOR IT
YOU DO THINGS AND I DO THINGS
AND IT IS THIS LAST ONE THAT OF CONSUMER SPENDING THAT I FIND THE MOST POTENTIAL FOR UN PROCESSING
HOW DOES A WATERMELON GET FROM THE GROUND IN HERMOSILLO TO A SAFEWAY IN TUCSON
BEFORE I GO THERE I WILL SAY I LOVE SUGAR
I HAVE DIETED ON AND OFF MY WHOLE LIFE
AND LET ME TELL YOU THE SCALE IS STAGGERING
IT COMES IN SO MANY DIFFERENT FORMS IT'S REALLY HAD TO AVOID
YES WE CALL HIM FARMER FRANK
SO WHEN YOU BUY FOOD THAT'S GONE THROUGH THIS VAST SYSTEM YOU ARE SUPPORTING THAT 91 CENTS
THE SECOND PROCESS IS WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU WHEN YOU ACTUALLY EAT THAT FOOD
I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WHERE MY MONEY IS GOING BECAUSE I KNOW WHO'S GETTING MY MONEY
MAKE IT YOUR ONE SWEET A DAY
OF COURSE ALL FOODS ARE PROCESSED
AGRICULTURE IS A KIND OF PROCESS SO IS COOKING FERMENTING DICING PRESERVING
BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS MOST OF US HAVE A FEW DOLLARS THAT WE COULD SPEND DIFFERENTLY
SUGAR IS IN EVERYTHING
A MIGRATING FIELD CREW GOES IN THERE AND HARVESTS THEM WITHIN A DAY THEY PACK THEM UP PUT THEM ON A SEMI TRUCK
THE SYSTEM IS VAST
IT'S ONE RULE AND THEN I DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT
BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW IS THAT FOR YOUR BODY SUGAR IS SUGAR
WE ALL REALLY LIKE IT
IT'S ONLY WHEN YOU AND I DECIDE TO MAKE SMALL CHANGES IN OUR OWN LIVES THAT BIG CHANGE BEGINS TO
SO IT TRICKLES INTO YOUR BODY SLOWER
APPLE JUICE ON THE OTHER HAND IS IMMEDIATE
I CAN DO WHAT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO WITH FOOD WHICH IS SIMPLY ENJOY IT
DO YOU FEEL DIFFERENTLY
LET'S GO BACK TO TONIGHT
LET'S GO TO THE SECOND PROCESS
AND THAT IMMEDIACY STRESSES YOUR BODY OUT
THIS IS WHAT I EAT
I'VE COUNTED CALORIES I'VE DONE WEIGHT WATCHERS REALLY I'VE BEEN THROUGH THE WRINGER
IT STARTS ON A FARM A REALLY BIG FARM 1000 ACRES OF WATERMELON
IT'S LIKE LEARNING A NEW LANGUAGE
MY CHILDHOOD WAS ONE LONG ROAD TRIP THROUGH ANTIQUITY
UNFORTUNATELY IT'D BE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE
BUT AT ALL TIMES YOU ARE LEARNING BY DOING
SCANNING A BOOK IS LIKE TAKING A DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPH OF EVERY PAGE OF THE BOOK
THAT IS DONE USING A TECNOLOGY CALLED OCR OPTICAL CHARACTER RECOGNITION WHICH TAKES A PICTURE OF TEXT AND TRIES TO
SO I WOULD LIKE TO TRANSLATE ALL OF THE WEB OR AT LEAST MOST OF IT INTO EVERY MAJOR LANGUAGE
WITH ENERGY A KEY PROBLEM IS THAT WE'VE GROWN HABITUATED TO HAVING SUCH A FABULOUS RELIABLE
AND THAT DEPENDENCY ONLY SHOWS ITSELF WHEN ENERGY'S GONE WHEN THE POWER GOES OUT AND YOU FIND YOURSELF EATING A COLD
IS A TOTALLY REASONABLE QUESTION
JUMPING TO PRE AGRICULTURAL HUMANS 50000 YEARS AGO OR SO WE TOOK IN ENERGY AS
WELL I CAN TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT IT FELT LIKE IN THE PRE ZEUS ERA
TO BE ABLE TO WALK WITH MY CLASS AND TO GRADUATE ON TIME
I WENT ON TO FURTHER MY EDUCATION
OH NOW I'M LOOKING AT HIS CROTCH
IT'S A BLAST
AND OFTEN WE OPT TO JUST NOT GO TO THE BATHROOM AT ALL
HOW DOES HE HAVE SEX
OK OK LET'S STOP THOSE HYPOTHETICAL QUESTIONS BEFORE WE GET TOO CLOSE FOR MY COMFORT
BEING TRANS IS AWKWARD BECAUSE EVERYONE ELSE GETS AWKWARD WHEN THEY'RE AROUND ME
AND THERE IS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS BEING SPENT ON THAT
THERE WAS NO AUDIBLE VOICE BUT MY FATHER CALLED OUT MY NAME POWERFULLY
JUST 72 HOURS AFTER HIS STROKE HE HAD ALREADY EMBRACED THE
IN ORDER FOR WESTWOOD TO CHANGE IT HAD TO BE OWNED BY THE PEOPLE SO WE DEVELOPED A RESIDENT LED APPROACH
EMPLOYEES HAD TO WALK THROUGH METAL DETECTORS AND WHEN LEAVING RECEIVE PAT DOWNS TO MAKE SURE THEY
IT ROSE 80 PERCENT BETWEEN 2014 AND 2015 AND WHEREAS GIRLS UNDER
AND THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH WANTING TO FEEL CLOSE TO YOUR PARTNER OR WANTING HIM TO BE HAPPY AND ORGASM ISN'T THE ONLY
IT WAS THAT GIRLS DIDN'T WANT THEM TO
WHO IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY
IN THE LARGEST EVER SURVEY EVER CONDUCTED ON AMERICAN SEXUAL BEHAVIOR THEY REPORTED
CONSIDER A SURVEY OF 300 RANDOMLY CHOSEN GIRLS FROM A DUTCH AND AN
NO SURPRISE FEWER THAN HALF OF TEENAGE GIRLS AGE 14 TO 17 HAVE EVER
THE ONE WHO MAKES OUT WITH A PARTNER FOR THREE HOURS AND EXPERIMENTS WITH SENSUAL TENSION
GIRLS EXPRESSED A SENSE OF SHAME AROUND THEIR GENITALS
MY GRANDMOTHER WAS A FIRECRACKER MY MOM IS A PROFESSIONAL MY SISTER AND I ARE LOUD AND THAT'S OUR
NO QUESTION IT'S CRUCIAL THAT YOUNG PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE GROUND RULES FOR CONSENT
BUT IT WASN'T ALWAYS THAT BOYS DIDN'T WANT TO
WHERE ARE THEY
I'M ALSO WORKING ON AN ANIMATED SERIES CALLED THE POLLINATORS
IT'S ABOUT BEES AND OTHER POLLINATORS IN OUR ENVIRONMENT AND WHY THEY'RE SO IMPORTANT
WHERE CAN I GET ONE
IF IT HAS THERE IS NO WAY THAT ANY FUTURE CIVILIZATION WILL BE ABLE TO RECOVER THE MEMORIES OF THESE FROZEN BRAINS
AND IF THAT WERE SUCCESSFUL THAT WOULD BE THE FIRST EXAMPLE OF READING A MEMORY FROM A CONNECTOME
I PROPOSE THAT WE ATTEMPT TO FIND A CONNECTOME OF A FROZEN BRAIN
WE KNOW THAT DAMAGE TO THE BRAIN OCCURS AFTER DEATH AND DURING FREEZING
IT'S CALLED FULL SPECTRUM
SO IT WAS TESTING AGAIN
COVER YOUR LEMON AND BE KIND TO PEOPLE
YOU KNOW AND THERE'S BEAUTY TO BE FOUND IN A MESS
COVER YOUR LEMON OKAY
IT'S ONLY THEN THAT WE GIVE UP CONTROL AND WE ACCIDENTALLY STUMBLE ON THINGS AND WE TEST THINGS WE TAKE
THINGS LIKE SILLY PUTTY TOTALLY ACCIDENTAL
I'M NOW FACE TO FACE WITH THE GRUMPY BUTCHER
IN THE FORMS OF RUMOR
THE BUILDING BEHIND ME IS LOCATED AT PENN STATE UNIVERSITY
BUT SHE'S SILENT
LET'S SAY YOU HAVE A PROBLEM YOU'RE TRYING TO SOLVE
AS IT'S EVIDENT IT WORKED FOR ME
WHEN I WAS 14 I MURDERED MR
I CALL THIS MY PEACE FORMULA
WE HAVE AN AFTER SCHOOL MENTORING PROGRAM AND WE CREATE A PEACE CLUB
AT MY UNDERSTANDING THAT MY GRANDSON WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MURDER OF THIS HUMAN BEING I WENT TO THE PRAYER CLOSET LIKE I WAS
THE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE IN THE TARIQ KHAMISA FOUNDATION PROVIDE SO MANY TOOLS FOR THE KIDS TO PUT IN THEIR TOOLKIT
WE NEED MORE OBSERVATIONS TO UNDERSTAND THESE PROCESSES MORE
WE NEED MATHEMATICIANS TO COME IN AND SIMULATE THIS TO DO MONTE CARLO THINGS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THESE TOOLS
AND WE HAVE TO CHANGE THIS
AND THOSE TOP 20 PERCENT HAVE BEEN THE BEST IN THE WORLD IF YOU MEASURE THEM AGAINST THE OTHER TOP
BECAUSE YOUR PAY GOES UP AND YOU VEST INTO YOUR PENSION
I THINK PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO RECOGNIZE HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS AND IT REALLY CAN
BUT THAT ALONE DOESN'T GIVE US THE ROAD MAP
BUT I I'M OPTIMISTIC
WE NEED RICH WORLD GOVERNMENTS TO BE VERY GENEROUS IN PROVIDING AID FOR THESE THINGS
THAT MEANS THAT IF THE ENTIRE U
IT'S GETTING WEAKER
NOT ONLY HAS THAT BEEN WEAK
AND THE ANSWER IS NO
THEY'RE CONSTANTLY IMPROVING THEIR TEACHERS
AND SO KIPP IS DOING IT
AND THAT HAD BEEN COVERED UP FOR A LONG TIME BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS TOOK THE DROPOUT RATE AS THE NUMBER WHO STARTED IN SENIOR YEAR
AT THE FOREFRONT
NOW THE STRENGTH FOR THOSE TOP 20 PERCENT IS STARTING TO FADE ON A RELATIVE
EVERYBODY NEEDS TO BE INVOLVED
IT INVOLVES SOCIAL SCIENTISTS SO WE KNOW HOW TO GET NOT JUST 70 PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE TO USE THE BED NETS BUT
AND SO THAT'S WHY THE DEATH RATE DID COME DOWN
SO EVERY TOOL THAT WE'VE EVER HAD IN THE PAST HAS EVENTUALLY BECOME INEFFECTIVE
IF YOU GO INTO A COUNTRY WITH THE RIGHT TOOLS AND THE RIGHT WAY YOU DO IT VIGOROUSLY YOU CAN
THEY'RE TAKING DATA THE TEST SCORES AND SAYING TO A TEACHER HEY YOU CAUSED THIS AMOUNT OF INCREASE
I HAD OTHER OPTIONS BUT I DIDN'T CHOOSE THEM
I SAID ALL RIGHT LET'S PRAY
FOR ME THE POLICING STOOD FOR POWER TO CORRECT POWER TO PREVENT AND POWER TO DETECT
I SAID DO YOU PRAY
I PRAYED FOR THEM AND THINGS STARTED TO CHANGE
THAT'S THE REASON AS A WOMAN I JOINED THE INDIAN POLICE SERVICE
I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO'S LEFT IN INDIA
SO WE ARE FOUR OF US IN FOUR CORNERS OF THE WORLD
AND SINCE I SAID THEY'RE MY ROLE MODELS I FOLLOWED TWO THINGS WHICH MY FATHER AND MOTHER GAVE ME
AND IT OPENED ME UP TO A MUCH BROADER UNDERSTANDING OF
SO SPOKEN LANGUAGES ARE ORGANIZED SEQUENTIALLY WITH ONE SOUND FOLLOWING
OKAY SO THE WAY WE PROCESS INFORMATION WITH OUR EYES OR OUR EARS DEFINITELY
THE OTHERS WOULD BE WEAK OR CRACKED
I THINK IT WAS THE RIGHT DECISION
LUCKILY IT DIDN'T COME TO THAT
SO I SAT DOWN WITH MY PARENTS AT THE SAME KITCHEN TABLE WHERE MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS HAD VOTED TO BRING ME HOME 14
SO WHAT THEY TOLD MY PARENTS WAS LOOK
SURE IF YOU WANT TO GO TO MOUNT EVEREST GO WALK UP TO BASE CAMP WAVE AT THE SUMMIT
AND I WENT IN TO HIS STUDIO AND LOOKED AT THIS MASSIVE PORTRAIT OF MY FACE AND
TAKE MY STORY FOR EXAMPLE
IN TERMS OF PARTICIPATION IN SOCIETY IT'S PROBABLY THE FACT THAT I HAVE NO LEGS THAT HAS MORE OF AN
AND SURE THE USUAL SUSPECTS ARE TO BLAME
NOW I'D HAD A COUPLE OF OPERATIONS BEFORE THEN
WE'RE VERY GOOD AT THIS SORT OF THING
AND THAT COULD WELL HAVE BEEN A CATALYST FOR GREAT SOCIAL CHANGE
AND TO EXPLORE THIS HE DID A SERIES OF CLASSIC STUDIES WITH BRITISH ADOLESCENTS
AND THERE ARE DIFFERENT AVENUES
AND SMITH SAYS HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND
AND THE THING IS THESE JUDGMENTS TEND TO BE ACCURATE
WE OPENLY ACKNOWLEDGE IT
AND MY FAVORITE EXAMPLE OF THIS IS A QUESTION THAT CAME FROM THE AUDIENCE IN A REPUBLICAN DEBATE PRIOR TO THE LAST
BUT HE HAD A LONG LASTING INTEREST IN THE SCIENCE OF PREJUDICE AND SO WHEN A PRESTIGIOUS BRITISH SCHOLARSHIP
ALL HER STUDENTS WERE MARINES
THEY MAKE SKILLS MANIFEST
IT WAS TIME FOR A CHANGE
WAS IT MEMBERS OF THE WELLNESS COMMUNITY
WE WOULD BREATHE THROUGH ONE NOSTRIL THEN THE OTHER WE WOULD DO BREATH HOLDS
I'M BREATHING WRONG
IT COMES FROM THE MILITARY
COME UP FROM THE BACK OF YOUR SEAT
SO I WANT YOU TO TIP FORWARD INHALE LET YOUR BELLY GO
I STARTED BY SIGNING UP FOR A YOGA CLASS WHERE WE WOULD DO BREATHING EXERCISES AT THE BEGINNING OF CLASS
ANCIENT YOGIS SAY WE COME INTO THIS WORLD WITH A CERTAIN NUMBER OF BREATHS AND WE CAN TAKE THEM
NOW WHO DO YOU THINK WERE THE FIRST PEOPLE THAT CALLED ME
WHAT WAS MOST ALARMING TO ME WAS WHEN I LOOKED AROUND ALMOST EVERYONE I KNEW
SO I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING
HOW COULD THIS BE
BECAUSE I'M SEEING IT
WE KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF THE BREATH
I WAS INTRIGUED
NOW MUCH OF THE CONFUSION AROUND BREATHING OCCURS BECAUSE WE DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THE DIAPHRAGM
IT'S MY FAVORITE ONE
THE VAGUS NERVE IS A NERVE THAT GOES TO THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD AND GOES THROUGHOUT YOUR WHOLE BODY
HOWEVER NINE OUT OF TEN PEOPLE BREATHE THIS WAY
TAKE YOUR HANDS
PUT THEM THERE
AND IT HAPPENS BECAUSE OF SEVERAL THINGS
AND NOW I KNOW THAT I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT
HOW WILL LATVIA HAVE ENOUGH LATVIANS
AND WHEN DO WE COLLABORATE
AND HOW TO BE SIMPLY GREAT
HOW TO CARE FOR THE WEAKEST IN THE COMMUNITY
OVER THE YEARS I'VE REALIZED THAT THERE ARE THREE KEY ELEMENTS THAT BRING ABOUT CHANGE
IF PEOPLE KNOW AND UNDERSTAND WHY AND HOW BUSINESS LEADERS MAKE DECISIONS IT IS EASIER
HOW DO WE KEEP THEM APART
SO THEY GET DRAGGED THERE ON A DATE OR SOMETHING
THIS IS A VERY HARD STONE
BY THE WAY HE WAS PAINTING CHRIST LIKE THIS TO SIGNIFY THE MAN CHILD THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO
MY FRIENDS TOLD THEIR FRIENDS AND THEIR FRIENDS TOLD THEIR FRIENDS
WHEN THEY COME WE WELCOME THEM TO THE MUSEUM
MY NAME IS NICK GRAY
THERE ARE TWO THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT YELLOW JASPER
THERE IS A LOT OF MYSTERY
THE NAME OF MY COMPANY IS MUSEUM HACK
I NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN HERE
I'VE BEEN TO THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM NOW MORE THAN 300 TIMES IN THE LAST THREE YEARS
WE DON'T EXACTLY KNOW WHO IT IS
WE HIRE PEOPLE FROM A DIVERSE SET OF BACKGROUNDS
OUR GUIDES WRITE ALL OF THEIR OWN ROUTES
I WOULD ASK MY FRIENDS I WOULD SAY THINK ABOUT THIS
SO THOSE WERE MY MUSEUM TOURS
THERE'S NO RISK INVOLVED
SO WHY ARE THE STAKES HIGHER FOR THIS
MY JOB IS TO ROOT OUT AND PREVENT ACTIVITY THAT MIGHT
IT'S TO THINK OF WHAT COULD GO WRONG
999 PERCENT OF TWEETS POSE NO RISK TO ANYONE
THERE'S NO THREAT INVOLVED
THAT'S PRETTY CLEARLY NOT A GOOD THING
WHAT WAS EVEN SCARIER AT LEAST TO ME WAS THAT THE LEAST COMPETENT PEOPLE WERE THE
HERE'S MY ADVICE
THEY SAID HE WAS AS SMART AS THEY COME
BUT A CLIENT OF MINE RECENTLY EXPLAINED WHAT I DO FAR BETTER THAN I EVER COULD
SO FOR ME IN MY WORK COACHING LEADERS I'M OFTEN SENT IN TO TELL SOMEONE THE TRUTH
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD THEY STARTED TALKING ABOUT THIS WONDERFUL GUY WHO THEY CALLED THE
IN A VERY SHORT TIME HE FELT A NEW LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE
SO THE BEST MARATHON RUNNERS DON'T ACTUALLY SHOW PHYSICAL DIFFERENCES WHAT'S DIFFERENT IS HOW MUCH THEY
NO NO LET'S BE HONEST
ON AND ON IT WENT ONE THING AT A TIME FOR MONTHS
BUT SOME OF YOU MIGHT BE MORE INTO NPR THAN SCIENCE
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU HAD NO IDEA WHAT YOU WERE DOING
SO I CONFIDENTLY STATE
IT'S THAT THING YOU'VE BEEN DYING TO MASTER
DOPAMINE IS THE SUBSTANCE THAT YOU GUYS ALL CRAVE
MATH WAS VERY BORING AS MOST OF YOU WOULD PROBABLY AGREE
BY THE TIME THEY GOT TO A MORE ADVANCED STAGE IT GOT EVEN MORE EXCITING
ONE OF THEM IS CALLED A DOPAMINE LOOP
HE CALLS IT DELIBERATE PRACTICE
HARD DOES NOT EQUAL BORING
PEOPLE WHO HONOR OUR STRENGTH AND WORK WITH NOT AGAINST OUR PERCEIVED LIMITATIONS
IT IS THIS FEAR THAT'S FEEDING THE DIET INDUSTRY WHICH IS KEEPING SO MANY OF US FROM MAKING
BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRIES THRIVE BECAUSE OF THE FEAR OF IT AND THOSE OF US WHO
NOT THE LOWERCASE MUTTERED BEHIND MY BACK KIND OR THE SEEMINGLY HARMLESS CHUBBY OR CUDDLY
I ALSO RECEIVE SMILES FROM STRANGERS WHO RECOGNIZE WHAT IT TAKES TO WALK DOWN THE STREET WITH A SPRING IN
WE DON'T WANT FEMALES WE WANT MALES
HER MOTHER SAYS
BUT THEN WHEN YOU GO TO THE WORKFORCE YOU FIND THAT THERE ARE LESS GIRLS
AND I THOUGHT WHY DON'T PEOPLE WANT TO ACHIEVE THEIR DREAMS
BECAUSE EVEN WHEN YOU GO TO GET THE JOB IN SOME CERTAIN WORKPLACE THEY SAY
THE 1ST QUESTION
THE MALES' ANSWERS WERE DECISIVE
THEY CAN ACTUALLY REACH UNIVERSITY LEVEL
I WAS MADE OF FLESH BUT I WASN'T PINK
THAT REMAINS A COMMON PRACTICE WORLDWIDE AND THAT WILL NOT
I'M A DOMINICAN DUTCH I GREW UP IN A MIXED FAMILY AND I'M A BISEXUAL WOMAN
I FIND MYSELF WONDERING WHAT KIND OF WORLD IS HE ENTERING
AND THAT WAS A SIMPLE CHOICE OF DECIDING YES' OR DECIDING NO
I WAS AGED 29 AT THE TIME
THIS WAS THE ONE TRUE DEFINING MOMENT OF MY LIFE
THERE SHE GOES
WHAT DO YOU DO
WOULD THE SAME KIND OF MISTAKES BE MADE WITH A REALLY STRESSFUL EVENT
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN OVER
WELL TITUS WAS CONSUMED WITH HIS CIVIL CASE
I'VE STUDIED MEMORY FOR DECADES
AND THIS GUY HE WAS UP TO A LOT OF NO GOOD
WE KIND OF SEE OURSELVES SEPARATE BUT WE'RE VERY MUCH A PART OF IT
AT THIS TIME WE'RE LIVING IN THE BRONX AND IN THE BUILDING NEXT TO WHERE I LIVED THERE WAS A GUY NAMED JOHNNY
AND HE DID SPEND A LOT OF TIME UP TO NO GOOD
AND HE WAS HANGING OUT WITH ALL US YOUNGER GUYS
DADDY'S GOT YOU
THAT'S ALL THAT'S IMPORTANT
NOW I EXPECTED HIM TO SAY SOMETHING LIKE I'D BE SAD I'D BE MAD I'D BE ANGRY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
SO JAPANESE GROUPS ARE FASCINATED WITH FOOD TEXTURES AND THEY HAVE SHOWN THAT ACTUALLY
YOU MIGHT THINK THIS IS NOT MUCH COMPARED TO THE BILLIONS OF NEURONS WE HAVE
AND THEN FINALLY LET ME POINT OUT THE LAST ONE A QUIRKY ONE
YOU HAVE WORK MOMENTS
YOU FIND A LOT OF OTHER DISTRACTIONS BUT NOT MANAGERS AND MEETINGS
IF YOU'RE INTERRUPTED AND WOKEN UP YOU HAVE TO START AGAIN
IT'S 10 HOURS OF PRODUCTIVITY TAKEN FROM THE REST OF THE ORGANIZATION TO HAVE THIS ONE HOUR MEETING WHICH PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN HANDLED
WHY IS THAT HAPPENING
WE PROBABLY WENT THROUGH IT YESTERDAY OR THE DAY BEFORE OR THE DAY BEFORE THAT
THAT'S KIND OF BAD
I HOPE THAT SOME OF THESE IDEAS WERE AT LEAST PROVOCATIVE ENOUGH FOR MANAGERS AND BOSSES AND BUSINESS
I CAN'T LET SOMEONE WORK AT HOME
ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU TELL THEM THEY HAVE TO STOP DOING THAT TO DO SOMETHING ELSE
FIRST THURSDAY OF THE MONTH JUST THE AFTERNOON NOBODY IN THE OFFICE CAN TALK TO EACH OTHER
THEY'RE FOR INTERRUPTING PEOPLE
WHICH IS RIDICULOUS BUT THAT'S ONE OF THE EXCUSES THAT MANAGERS GIVE
AND I'M ONE OF THESE MANAGERS
SO IF YOU'RE A MANAGER START ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO USE MORE THINGS LIKE I
YOU DON'T HAVE A WORK DAY ANYMORE
ONE IS KIND OF A PLACE OR A LOCATION OR A ROOM
I'VE BEEN ASKING PEOPLE THIS QUESTION FOR ABOUT 10 YEARS
WHERE DO YOU GO WHEN YOU REALLY NEED TO GET SOMETHING DONE
THAT'S KIND OF RIDICULOUS
THIS IS AMERICA
YOU ARE WITH ME ON THAT RIGHT
I'M NOT ADVOCATING DOING AWAY WITH THE STANDARDS
NOT WHAT KIDS SHOULD DO
WHEN WE WAIT UNTIL AFTER SCHOOL FOR THAT THEN WE ARE MISSING THE POINT THAT WE ADULTS ADOPTED IN THE FIRST
IN 2014 24 YEAR OLD BASSIL DA COSTA HAD NEVER BEEN TO ONE OF THESE PROTESTS BEFORE
I FELT THE SAME INTENSE CALL FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AT THE MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR HEATHER WHEN HER MOTHER
AND THE SHORTAGE OF MEDICINE AND BASIC CARE SUPPLIES ARE THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF DEATH IN THE
BUT I'M HERE WITH A MESSAGE OF HOPE
BUT WITH THE LOVE AND SUPPORT OF MY LOCAL COMMUNITY WHO GAVE ME AND MY BUSINESS A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE I
MY PLAN OF COMING TO THE UNITED STATES TO PURSUE GRADUATE STUDIES AT UCLA BECAME MY TICKET TO ESCAPE THE
WE ARE VERY WELCOMING AND JUST LIKE THE UNITED STATES VENEZUELA IS A COUNTRY OF
THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS ALSO COLLAPSING
IT'S ACTUALLY NOT
I STILL LOVE CHICKEN NUGGETS BUT NOW THEY ARE VEGAN
SHE TOLD ME THAT WE KILLED ANIMALS FOR THEM
MORE OFTEN THAN NOT IT'S A POWER STRUGGLE IN ONE COUNTRY OR EVEN A SMALL REGION WITHIN ONE COUNTRY
I LIVE IN NEW YORK NOW
WHO KILLED BIN LADENISM
WE DON'T HAVE TO GO BACK TO THAT
NOW NOT ALL OF THESE THINGS WILL WORK IN LOCAL JIHAD
THEY HAD SEEN PICTURES OF THE PLANES GOING INTO THE TOWERS THE TOWERS COMING DOWN
BUT THEY HAVE BEEN DISTRACTED RECENTLY
HE MADE IT OUR PROBLEM
I LOST ABOUT A POUND A WEEK FOR ABOUT 40 WEEKS
AND THE LARGE COMPANIES THEY TYPICALLY HAVE WONDERFUL WELLNESS PROGRAMS BUT THE MEDIUM SIZED COMPANIES THAT TYPICALLY
WE WEREN'T ANYWHERE CLOSE TO THE TOP BUT WE WERE ON THE LIST WE WERE SOMEBODY
AND SO THEY STARTED HELPING US DRIVE TRAFFIC TO THE WEBSITE
WE HAVE THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE UNITED STATES PROBABLY THE STRONGEST ECONOMY IN THE UNITED STATES
OUR STREETS WERE REALLY WIDE AND YOU'D PUSH THE BUTTON TO ALLOW YOU TO WALK ACROSS AND YOU HAD TO RUN
WE HOSTED THE OLYMPIC TRIALS LAST SPRING
WE'RE EVEN GOING BACK INTO SOME INNER CITY SITUATIONS WHERE WE HAD BUILT NEIGHBORHOODS AND WE HAD BUILT
YOU KNOW THESE ARE CITIES THAT TYPICALLY YOU'RE NOT EMBARRASSED TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH
OUR BANKING INDUSTRY OUR OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY OUR COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY WERE ALL AT THE BOTTOM OF THE
AND THE ECONOMY INDEED SEEMED TO START SHOWING SOME SIGNS OF LIFE
THE NEXT MAYOR CAME ALONG
YOU'RE HAVING TO IMAGINE IT
NOW THAT'S A REALLY SERIOUS PROBLEM
EVERYBODY WOULD BE MUCH BETTER OFF
LAST YEAR ALL THE FESTIVITIES WERE CANCELED BECAUSE OF THE CONFLICT
I ASKED HIM
IT HAD GONE ON FOR TWO AND A HALF YEARS
IT WAS IMMENSELY COSTLY AND STRESSFUL NOT ONLY TO BOTH PARTIES BUT TO THEIR FAMILIES
WHAT DO YOU MEAN PROGRESS
AS A RESULT I'M NOT WIRED TO BE CONTENT WITH THE STATUS QUO
MORE THAN ONCE I STARE DOWN THE BARREL OF A SEMI AUTOMATIC WEAPON WITH THE SWEATY TRIGGER FINGER
I HAVE NO CONTEXT FOR IT
BUT I SHOW UP ANYWAY
I'M NOW IN MY FORTIES
LET YOUR CHILDREN EXPERIENCE SOME OF THE HARDSHIPS OF EVERYDAY LIFE SO THEY CAN GET TO KNOW THEIR MOST
MY PARENTS' GAMBLE HAS PAID OFF
SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN CLOSED AND THEY WON'T REOPEN
HE WANTS US OUT OF THE COUNTRY
I LIVE IN EXILE
DO I SHAKE THEIR HAND
MAYBE WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE
SO WHAT IF WE COULD START OFF BY GOING INTO THE BRAIN AND JUST FINDING A SINGLE MEMORY TO BEGIN WITH
EVER SINCE THE PUBLICATION OF OUR WORK WE'VE BEEN RECEIVING NUMEROUS COMMENTS FROM ALL OVER THE
SO FAR WHAT WE'VE TOLD YOU IS BASICALLY WE CAN CONTROL THIS PLAY BUTTON OF THE CLIP SO THAT WE CAN PLAY THIS VIDEO
DO I SAY HI
AND TODAY WE HOPE TO CONVINCE YOU THAT NOW WE ARE ACTUALLY ABLE TO ACTIVATE A MEMORY IN THE BRAIN
FIRST YOU FIND AND LABEL A MEMORY IN THE BRAIN AND THEN YOU ACTIVATE IT WITH A
IT TURNED OUT THAT ALL WE NEED TO DO IS BASICALLY TO LET THE BRAIN FORM A MEMORY AND THEN THE BRAIN WILL
WHY IS IT THAT THE RELATIONSHIP IN CHINA IS SO IMPORTANT
VALERIE I AM SORRY BUT DO YOU MIND SWAPPING CHAIRS I AM NOT COMFORTABLE SITTING IN THIS ANGLE FROM THE MAIN ENTRANCE
IT'S LIKE BEING ON THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN AND JUST BOBBING ALL THE TIME AND NOT EVER
SO WHAT KIND OF PROBLEMS
THE IMAGE I LIKE BEST IS A FLASHLIGHT WE CAN USE THE MIND LIKE A FLASHLIGHT
IT'S HUMAN OF COURSE TO HAVE THESE KINDS OF EMOTIONS BUT WHAT WE DON'T HAVE TO
A LOT OF BUZZING OF THE MIND
HE SAID WELL WHY DIDN'T YOU USE A RATIO
A RATIO THAT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN AS EXACT
FORTUNATELY HELP WAS AT HAND
BUT WHAT ABOUT IF WE JUST CHANGE THAT STORY
WE HAD A BIT OF A BATTLE OF WILLS
I HAD A MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT THERE WHO TOLD ME ABOUT HIS EXIT STRATEGY FOR HIS COUNTRY
FOR HAPPINESS TO COME AND FIND ME
BUT IT WAS NOT WITHOUT MISADVENTURE
DO I HAVE A CHASE BOAT
I'M TOTALLY SELF SUPPORTING OUT THERE
I BLOGGED ABOUT IT
THEY CAN STAY HOME AND TAKE CARE OF ANYBODY'S CHILDREN
WE SHRUNK THE DIMENSIONS OF THIS TECHNOLOGY FROM THE MICRON SCALE TO THE TRUE NANOSCALE
WITH THE WORK THAT MY TEAM HAS ALREADY DONE ON SEPARATION OF NANOSCALE BIOMARKERS FOR RAPID EARLY STAGE
SO HOW DOES IT WORK
AND WE HAVE DONE WITH IT WHAT THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY HAS DONE SO SUCCESSFULLY FOR THE PAST 50 YEARS
WE'RE WORKING ON WAYS TO FREQUENTLY ACTIVATE AN EARLY STAGE CANCER ALARM BY ENABLING
AND BECAUSE THEY'RE ABUNDANTLY PRESENT IN JUST ABOUT EVERY BODILY FLUID INCLUDING BLOOD URINE AND SALIVA
ONCE THOUGHT TO BE LITTLE BINS FOR UNWANTED CELLULAR WASTE IT HAS BEEN FOUND THAT CELLS ACTUALLY
IT MAY ENCOURAGE MORE PEOPLE TO SIGN UP TO BE POTENTIAL LIVE SAVING BONE MARROW DONORS
HANDS IT BACK TO ME
YOU ALL KNOW ABOUT EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS
THEY'VE GOT GREAT POTENTIAL BUT HAVEN'T YET ENTERED CLINICAL TRIALS
I ENDED UP ON A CONSERVATIVE WEBSITE
WAS IT EASY
I WILL TELL YOU
DON'T EXPECT COMPANIES TO HELP YOU FIGHT HOMELESSNESS
ALL THE HAPPINESS IS IN OUR SURROUNDINGS
SO THE MEDIA WE ARE SHOWN CAN AFFECT SOCIETY BY AFFECTING THE WAY WE VIEW DIVERSE GROUPS
SIMILAR DATA HAS BEEN AROUND FOR QUITE SOME TIME
HOW ARE THEY ORGANIZED
THERE'S NO INHERENT MEANING IN INFORMATION
IF YOU STIMULATE A BIT MORE THE GAIT ACCELERATES
TO ME ACTUALLY IT'S HIGHLY MEANINGFUL
PERCEPTION IS AN ACTIVE PROCESS
AND WE THEN HAVE TO IMAGINE WHAT COULD HAVE CAUSED THOSE
THE REASON IT'S MEANINGFUL TO ME IS I HAVE PRIOR EXPECTATIONS AND PRIOR KNOWLEDGE
AND PEIRCE POINTED OUT THAT ACTUALLY THIS IS ONE OF THE SHAKIEST MOST FRAGILE MOST TENUOUS FORMS OF LOGICAL INFERENCE THAT YOU
MESSAGES IN VERBAL AND VISUAL AND EVEN TELEPATHIC FORMS THAT WERE HIGHLY CRITICAL OF HIM VERY UNPLEASANT
THAT'S ALL WE CAN KNOW OF IT DIRECTLY
EVERYTHING ELSE IS LOGICAL INFERENCE
AND WE USED TO THINK ISN'T THAT GREAT
SO BACK INTO THE LABORATORY
SO YOU WANT TO GET IT FROM FOOD THAT'S THE FORM THAT NATURE HAS DESIGNED FOR US AND THAT'S THE FORM THAT WE'VE EVOLVED WITH
OR COPPER PIPES
UNTIL WE REALIZED IRON IS A DOUBLE EDGED SWORD
IT DECIDES WHAT SHOULD BE LET THROUGH INTO MEMORY AND WHAT SHOULD NOT BE LET THROUGH
THAT PURPLE COLOR THOSE ANTHOCYANINS HAPPEN TO BE POWERFUL ANTIOXIDANTS
AND IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN I NEED A FIRE EXTINGUISHER
AND ALSO WHO EATS OFF A PYRAMID ANYWAY
IF YOU HAVE THOSE DICED SALTY ALMONDS AND YOU'VE EATEN THEM
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT SALTY CASHEWS AND ALMONDS IS IT JUST ME
WHO HAS COPPER PIPES
AND THE FACT THAT IT'S SOLID AT ROOM TEMPERATURE IS A SIGN THAT BACON GREASE IS LOADED WITH
AND THIS IS MY MOST IMPORTANT POINT
I LEFT MY FRYING PAN ON THE PICNIC TABLE AND IT RAINED LAST WEEK
THEY'RE LIKE WE KNOW
I HAD MISSED THE POINT
AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT OFTEN IS MISSING FROM POLITICAL ADVERTISING BECAUSE IN THE UNITED
IN BOTH OF THESE CASES THE BULLYING WAS VERY EXPLICIT
WHAT COULD BE DONE ABOUT IT
WHAT I AM TRYING TO DO IS I'M TRYING TO BRING THOSE TWO VIEWS INTO ONE SO THAT MY IMAGES
AND HE'S BEEN THERE SINCE
AND WE ALSO CONDUCTED A SURVEY IN THREE DIFFERENT SITES
OVER A QUARTER OF ITS POPULATION ARE NOW SYRIAN REFUGEES
NOW THERE'S NOTHING INEVITABLE ABOUT WULI'S SITUATION
BUSES RUN DAILY BETWEEN THE NAKIVALE REFUGEE SETTLEMENT AND THE CAPITAL CITY TRANSPORTING REFUGEES
IT'S NOT THAT PAINFUL BUT IT'S QUITE EMBARRASSING
THEY'VE BEEN IN EXILE FOR AT LEAST FIVE YEARS
ON THE CONTRARY WE FOUND ALMOST UBIQUITOUS MOBILE PHONE USE
NOW IN HIS MID 40S HE SUFFERS FROM DIABETES AND HYPERTENSION AND HE'S GIVEN UP HOPE OF LEAVING
THERE WERE MANY EXAMPLES OF CONTRIBUTIONS
IS THERE ANOTHER WORLD WE CAN IMAGINE IN WHICH WE DOCUMENT THAT POSITIVE CONTRIBUTION
THERE IS ANOTHER WAY OF LOOKING AT THIS
ONE EXAMPLE OF A BUSINESS WAS THERE WAS PUBLIC TRANSPORT SYSTEM
BUT THAT BUSINESS ISN'T RUN BY UGANDANS
THERE WAS A HUGE VARIATION IN OUTCOMES
FOOD SHELTER AND CLOTHING ARE ALL NECESSARY AND NEEDED
THE URBAN CONTEXT OF THE CAPITAL CITY KAMPALA AND TWO REFUGEE SETTLEMENTS AMONG SOMALIS
BUT THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE
THEY ARE NOT
THERE WAS ALSO INEQUALITY
TAKE THE EXAMPLE OF LEBANON WITH A POPULATION OF JUST OVER 4 MILLION
CAN YOU IMAGINE BEING BORN IN A REFUGEE CAMP GROWING UP IN A REFUGEE CAMP BECOMING AN ADULT
I MET PEOPLE FROM BOSNIA FROM KOSOVO FROM CHINA FROM IRAQ IRAN LIBERIA
PEOPLE FLEEING FOR THEIR LIVES
WHAT I FOUND WAS LOTS OF LITERATURE ON REFUGEES
BUT IT LACKS TWO THINGS
THEY HAD A HUGE RANGE OF ACTIVITIES
BUT LIFE HAS A WAY OF HAPPENING TO YOU SO WHEN I FINALLY WANTED TO GO AND STUDY I WAS ALREADY IN
SO IN MY CASE BEING BLESSED BY HARDSHIPS MADE ME LOOK OUTSIDE
AND SLOWLY I REALIZED THAT I WAS STARTING TO LIVE MY LIFE IN THAT WAY NOT JUST TO MAKE MY
BUT HERE'S THE CATCH
TIME AND TIME AGAIN RANDOM STRANGERS WENT OUT OF THEIR WAY TO HELP US OUT OR
EVERY HOTEL IN THE CITY IS EXACTLY THE SAME
IT'S UP TO US TO START THE PROCESS
PENICILLIN WAS DEVELOPED BY A SCOTTISH SCIENTIST WHO CAME BACK FROM VACATION TO FIND A TYPE OF
THESE BIOPRODUCTS HAVE A HUGE POTENTIAL TO MAKE THE WORLD MUCH MORE SUSTAINABLE AND IT'S CURRENTLY UNDERGOING
WITHIN THREE MONTHS MY BEST FRIEND FROM GRADUATE SCHOOL AND I STARTED A COMPANY DEVELOPING AND COMMERCIALIZING ALGAE INK
THE SEA LEVEL IS RISING AND THERE IS VERY LITTLE ROOM FOR THESE HABITATS TO RETREAT TO
WHAT CAN I DO
IT IS CAUSING CASES OF CHOLERA TO RISE
A WARMER CLIMATE MEANS THESE STORMS ARE BECOMING MORE INTENSE AND MORE LONG LIVED
OUR COASTLINES THEY'RE OUR FAVORITE PLACE TO LIVE WE'VE DESTROYED A LOT OF THESE HABITATS
HERE WE ARE
NOW MORE THAN 500 YEARS AFTER THOMAS MORE FIRST WROTE ABOUT A BASIC INCOME AND 100 YEARS AFTER GEORGE ORWELL
EVELYN FORGET DISCOVERED THAT THE PEOPLE IN DAUPHIN HAD NOT ONLY BECOME RICHER BUT ALSO SMARTER AND HEALTHIER
WE'VE GOT THE RESEARCH WE'VE GOT THE EVIDENCE AND WE'VE GOT THE MEANS
WE ALSO NEED TO BE FOR SOMETHING
WHAT THEY SUBSEQUENTLY DISCOVERED COMPLETELY BLEW MY MIND
IT GETS SLOWER AND SLOWER MAKING ERRORS
BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH
LET'S ALLOW FOR THE CREATION OF A COMMON DREAM
WORLD MYTHOLOGIES AND RELIGIONS ARE FULL OF EXAMPLES OF HEROES WHO CHOSE THIS WAY IN ORDER TO BE
EACH ONE OF US ENCOMPASSES THE OTHER EACH ONE OF US ENCOMPASSES THAT FORCE THAT WE PUT BEHIND
DISPLEASING TRAITS THAT WE DON'T WANT TO FACE THAT WE DON'T WANT TO
AND VICE VERSA
AND THEN WE CAN CONFRONT THE SHADOW
I TRIED TO WRITE ABOUT THINGS THAT NEW YORKERS EXPERIENCE AND I FIGURED WHAT DO NEW YORKERS EXPERIENCE MORE THAN DUANE
IS THIS ALL A BIG DEAL
THEY'RE NOT DROPPING YOU OFF ON THE CORNER AND SAYING GOOD LUCK BUDDY
SO TODAY I AM GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT MY JOURNEY OVER THE LAST YEAR WHERE I HAVE ACCIDENTALLY BECAME A
WHAT IF WE TAKE ONE IDEA AND THAT IDEA IS GENDER
AS OPPOSED TO NOW I'M GOING TO PAY 20
43 AND YOU PAY
I CONSIDER THOSE TO BE MAKING AN IMPACT AS WELL
HOW MUCH WOULD THAT BE
AND THEY SAY 18
I DID IMPROV SINCE I WAS ABOUT 13 I'VE BEEN DOING IT EVER SINCE
I AM LEARNING NEW YORK I HAVE LIVED HERE FOR OVER A DECADE SO I FOCUS ON NEW YORK
I NOTICE A FEW THINGS
7 MILLION DOCUMENTS
TIM ACTUALLY WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME UP AND SAY DO WE HAVE A MICROPHONE FOR TIM
THE WORLD'S LIBRARY IS AMAZON
SURELY THAT MAKES IT A PRICE WORTH PAYING
I MEAN LOOK IF YOU'VE DONE NOTHING WRONG YOU'VE GOT NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT
SO I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME TO THE TED STAGE THE MAN BEHIND THOSE REVELATIONS
I WOULDN'T USE PATRIOT AND I WOULDN'T USE TRAITOR
SOME ARE RESPONSIBLE
THAT IS OF COURSE THE FIRST LINE OF L
HOW ABOUT RELIGION
HISTORY DOESN'T REPEAT ITSELF BUT IT RHYMES SAID MARK TWAIN
OCCASIONALLY THEY HAD STORIES CIRCULATING OF A WOMAN OR A GIRL LEAPING OVER A FENCE AND THEN
THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL WHICH HAS ERIC BANA SCARLETT JOHANSSON NATALIE PORTMAN RE IMMAGINES
ONE ACADEMIC WE WORKED WITH SAID HE HAD ALWAYS KNOWN THAT BUT IT WAS ONLY WHEN HE SAW IT ON THIS DOORWAY WHICH LOOKS A LITTLE BIT LIKE A
IN 1572 A NEW STATUTE SUGGESTED THAT THEY SHOULD BE GRIEVOUSLY WHIPPED AND THEY SHOULD BE BRANDED THROUGH THE EAR
OF COURSE WE ARE SLIGHTLY PERVERSELY FASCINATED BY GORE
THEY MARKET THEMSELVES AS HISTORY WITH THE NASTY BITS LEFT IN
WOMEN PERHAPS THIS IS THE MOST BIZARRE ONE OF ALL SINCE THE TIME OF ARISTOTLE THROUGH TILL ABOUT THE 18TH CENTURY WHERE
WE NEED TO TRY AND UNDERSTAND IT
HISTORICAL CHARACTERS LIKE CHROMEWELL FOR EXAMPLE FROM HER OWN IMAGINATION AS IS THE NOVELIST'S PREROGATIVE
I'M GOING TO PUT IT LIKE THIS
AGAIN THE QUESTION COMES TO US
A FILM LIKE THE DUCHESS WHICH IS THE STORY OF AN 18TH CENTURY ARISTOCRAT HAD THE STRAP LINE
DO WE HAVE A VISA
HISTORIANS MIGHT ACTUALLY GO FURTHER SAY THAT IT'S A FOREIGN COUNTRY THAT IT'S ACTUALLY AN IMAGINARY COUNTRY THAT IS MORE
IS THE PAST A FOREIGN COUNTRY
SOME GIVE IT ENERGY OTHERS TRANSPORT THINGS BACK AND FORTH KIND OF LIKE A METRO SYSTEM OR A RAILROAD
BUT IF THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE IF OUR SURVIVAL IS AT STAKE
IT'S AN INTERESTING WORD COEVOLUTION
EXCEPT IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE IT'S ALSO GOING TO NOT ONLY RESTORE AND REPLACE LOST FUNCTION
ASTONISHINGLY THEY FOUND AN ENORMOUS INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF NEW NEURAL CONNECTIONS IN THOSE
AND IN THE SENSE OF WHEN WE SAY TECHNOLOGIES THIS IS REALLY A BROADER SENSE THAT IT DOESN'T
AND SO IN MANY RESPECTS TECHNOLOGICAL EVOLUTION DOES FOLLOW MANY OF THE SAME PATTERNS AS WELL
IF YOU HADN'T NAILED HIM TO THE PERCH HE'D BE PUSHING UP DAISIES
WHEN WE LOST SAMMY
I TRULY BELIEVE THAT USING A DIRECT AND RESPECTFUL WAY OF TALKING
HIS METABOLIC PROCESSES ARE NOW HISTORY
WE DO SPEND AN AWFUL LOT OF OUR TIME TRYING TO AVOID IT
DEAD IS DEAD
WELL WAIT A MINUTE
IT S HARD TO CHOOSE THOSE WORDS JUST AS IT'S HARD TO SAY THAT MY EIGHT YEAR OLD SON
HE IS OFF THE TWIG
POLITICIANS USE EUPHEMISM ALL THE TIME TO TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT THEY DON T WANT TO TALK
CAN WE FACETIME HIM
CAN WE CALL HIM
WE MIGHT SAY SOMEONE IS LET GO WHEN WE MEAN FIRED
MY PHONE DIED
MY PHONE IS OUT OF BATTERY CHARGE
IN FACT I BELIEVE THAT SHROUDING AND CLOUDING DEATH IN PRETTY SUGAR COATED
OH LET S GO FIND HIM
HE HAS RUN SHUFFLED OFF HIS MORTAL COIL RUN DOWN THE CURTAIN AND JOINED THE BLEEDING CHOIR
OKAY SO CAN WE TALK TO HIM
THIS SHOULD BE A VERY USEFUL REFERENCE FOR TEACHING A CHILD ABOUT DEATH RIGHT
AND I'M NOT TRYING TO BE HARSH I'M REALLY NOT
DEATH MAKES US SO UNCOMFORTABLE
AND YET THAT IS WHAT I FOUND MYSELF FACED WITH IN 2012 WHEN MY
BUT SAM DIDN'T PASS US BY
COM WHICH HAS OVER 6
IT S NOT GIVING POWER TO DEATH TO SPEAK ITS NAME
AND WHEN YOU HEAR A PHRASE LIKE THAT YOU REALLY BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT IT
WE TOOK THE LAMP BACK TO THE UNIVERSITY AND WE THOUGHT OK WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT
AND WE WERE LIKE WHY
LIKE RALPH SAID
MAKE YOU BE PART OF THE MOVIE
SO IT CAN GO LIGHTING UP FROM THE BOTTOM TO THE TOP
1 2 3 THEN IT STOPS AND THEN IT GOES ALL THE WAY DOWN
I WAS ENVIOUS OF MY FRIENDS
THEY TOOK ME TO THE TERMINALLY ILL WARD
MY PARENTS HAD NO IDEA WHAT WOULD TRANSPIRE FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS
THEY'RE SUPPORTIVE OF YOUR DREAMS
I PICKED IT UP BECAUSE IT WAS ON THE BEST SELLER LIST AND IT WAS THE SMALLEST ONE
I WOULD TELL YOU THAT FROM TODAY ONWARDS SOMEONE IS GOING TO DO SOMETHING TO YOU THAT WILL HURT YOU THAT WILL DISAPPOINT YOU SOMEONE WILL EMBARRASS
THAT'S WHAT I DO BUT I THINK LIFE THERE'S SO MUCH MORE TO IT
BUT I'M HUMAN AND THE THING ABOUT BEING HUMAN IS THAT YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO
IT STRESSED ME OUT A LOT
WE ARE TAUGHT NOT ONLY TO EMBRACE THIS NATURALLY BUT TO GROW FROM IT
PREVAILING GLOBAL ISSUES SUCH AS RACISM WE WOULD NEVER EVEN UNDERSTAND
I WAS SPOTTED AT A MALL ON SUKHUMVIT AND SIGNED MY CONTRACT TWO MONTHS AFTER
AND THEY SAY THESE THINGS AS IF IT'S OK
AND SO WE SHOULD
ARE THERE MEN AROUND THAT TABLE
ARE THERE MOMS WHO'VE RAISED BOYS AROUND THAT TABLE
WHAT DID I SEE TO BE EXCEPT MYSELF
ANOTHER KNUCKLE IS LOOKING TO CRACK INTO MY DAUGHTER'S SKIN
MY ONE HAND HOLDING TIGHT MY OTHER
THE WHOLE POINT IS FOR HOPE RIGHT
A PART OF ME IS REALLY TRYING TO WORK TOWARD OBSOLESCENCE
AND NOW I FIND MYSELF WRITING ALL THESE POEMS AS ADVICE TO MY FUTURE SELF UPON BEING A
DON'T TELL ME IT'S WRONG TO WANT TO RAISE A CHILD FROM THIS KIND OF FEAR
AND WE DIDN'T HAVE THE EVIDENCE FOR THAT
LET'S THINK OF LIFE AS THAT ENTIRE PLANET BECAUSE IN A SENSE IT IS
WE DON'T WANT TO GO BLIND BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MANY POSSIBILITIES AND THERE IS NOT TOO MUCH LAB AND
WHAT ABOUT THE IDEA OF THE PLURALITY OF THE WORLDS ABOUT LIFE ON OTHER PLANETS
IN FACT I'M BORROWING HERE FROM ONE OF THOSE VERY POPULAR BOOKS OF THE TIME
AND HERE BEGINS 400 YEARS OF FRUSTRATION OF
VODKA NEW YEAR'S EVE NEW PARTNER FOR THE SPRING
PROBABLY IT'S A COMBINATION OF THIS
IN SWEDEN WE HAVE NO CONCURRENCY
VODKA MIDSUMMER'S EVE NEW PARTNER FOR THE FALL
AFTER ALL IF YOU ARE COMPLETELY HEALTHY AND YOU HAVE HETEROSEXUAL SEX THE RISK OF INFECTION IN ONE INTERCOURSE
WE HAVE SERIAL MONOGAMY
25 YEARS IT TOOK
IT IS ONLY BY STOPPING THE TRANSMISSION THAT THE WORLD WILL BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH IT
THESE ARE YOUR CHILDREN AND THEY'RE CRYING OUT FOR YOUR HELP
BUT I KNOW NOW WENDY WAS AN EMPLOYEE SHE WAS A WORKER
I SAW IT LAST YEAR WHEN I WAS IN A CHURCH HALL SURROUNDED BY 300 PEOPLE PROTESTING THE BUILD OF A
BUT I'LL NEVER FORGET THE NEIGHBOUR THAT USED TO COME AND CHECK ON ME
THAT'S ALL WE WANT AN EQUAL CHANCE AT LIFE
IT WASN'T OUR FAULT
SO MUCH SO THAT I DIDN'T WANT TO BE HERE ANYMORE
AND I FELL APART IN THAT WOMAN'S ARMS AND SHE CUDDLED ME IN LIKE I WAS HER OWN CHILD
TEN ISN'T EVEN A BIG NUMBER
AND THE NEIGHBOUR THAT GOT ME HELP WHEN I NEEDED IT
DO YOU THINK THE SUFFRAGETTES LET FEAR WIN WHEN THEY WERE CAMPAIGNING FOR THE WOMAN'S RIGHT TO VOTE
SHE WASN'T ALLOWED TO TELL ME THAT SHE LOVED ME
THIS IS WHAT THOSE PEOPLE HAD TO SAY
AND I WAS ANGRY
50 OF US LEAVE WITH A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE AND WE'RE 20 TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DIE BY THE TIME WE GET
THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT CONTINUE TO JUDGE US AND WANT US TO BE SILENCED
BUT WE ARE THE LUCKY ONES
I'LL TELL YOU
THAT IS THE ESSENCE OF SEEING A PERSON FIRST
WE WERE EKING THINGS OUT A BIT LONGER
WE KNEW EXACTLY WHERE WE WERE HEADED
AND YET OUR SPEED THAT WE'VE USED THESE MATERIALS HAS INCREASED RAPIDLY EXPONENTIALLY
EVEN IF EVERYBODY CHANGED IT WOULDN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM
IT FELT LIKE WE WERE BUYING OURSELVES TIME
EIGHT SAIL CHANGES IN 12 HOURS
THERE IS NO MORE
THESE FIGURES COULDN'T BE EXACT BUT WE KNEW THOSE MATERIALS WERE FINITE
THE THING WITH DINOSAURS IS DINOSAURS ARE KIND OF AWESOME MORE THAN THAT THEY ACTUALLY EXISTED
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
LIKE IF YOU'RE WITH A DINOSAUR EVERYTHING ELSE SEEMS SECONDARY
YES MY LOVE IS REAL
THIS AIN'T NO DAMSEL IN DISTRESS TRAPPED PRINCESS DRAGON SLAYING QUEST BECAUSE 1 DRAGONS NEVER HAPPENED 2 MOST
AND IF I WAS A T
YES I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU TAKE ME AS AS THE INTELLIGENCE THAT HB HAS BUT FROM FRACTIONS TO DECIMALS I AIN'T DUMB
AND IF YOU'RE HAVING A NUMBER PROBLEM I FEEL BAD FOR YOU SON
I'M BREAK IT DOWN FOR THE PI SOLO LIKE 3
I ASKED MY EMPLOYERS TO DONATE ALL MY WAGES TO CHARITY
IT'S SOMETHING ALL OF US CAN RELATE TO
NO LONGER IS OUR WORK SOMETHING THAT WE MERELY ENDURE
YEARS LATER AFTER HIS PHYSICAL WOUNDS HAD HEALED AND HE'D RETURNED HOME HE RARELY SPOKE OF HIS
INITIALLY IT WAS A DAUNTING PROCESS FOR THE SERVICE MEMBER BUT EVENTUALLY HE BEGAN TO THINK OF BFIB AS THE MASK
IN WHAT QUANTITY
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW IT WAS STORED THEIR STABILITY ISSUES
AND NATURAL DOESN'T ALWAYS MEAN SOMETHING IS HEALTHY
IT MUST BE GOOD FOR ME
IT'S PROBABLY ALSO HEALTHY
FIRST OF ALL
LET ME GIVE YOU AN INTERESTING EXAMPLE
BUSINESS STRATEGY MEANS FINDING GAPS IN THE MARKET THINGS THAT NOBODY ELSE IS DOING
IT HAS TO STAND OUT FROM THE CROWD
WE BRING TOGETHER HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF EXPERTS TO SOLVE IMPORTANT PROBLEMS FOR INDUSTRY AND ACADEMIA
WHEN STUDENTS ASK ME WHAT CAN I DO FOR THE ENVIRONMENT
HOW ABOUT 30 PEOPLE
HOW ABOUT 100 PEOPLE
WHAT IF SCHOOLS COULD PLAY WITH IT AND ACTUALLY CHANGE THE CODE ON IT
WHEREVER OUR DESTINY TAKES US WHETHER IT IS TRANSHUMANISM WHERE THE BODY FUSES WITH NON
SOME WOULD SAY IT'S FOOD
NO JOBS ARE A SUBSET OF WORK
HE CREATES AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE WORK IS CREATED AND WE GO OUT THERE AND SEEK THE JOBS THAT SOMEBODY
IT'S CALLED SATISFICING
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT
IF YOU HAD FINISHED SOME FORM OF HIGHER EDUCATION YOU GOT A RED KEY CORD WITH YOUR NAME TAG ON IT INSTEAD OF A BLUE ONE
IT HAPPENS TO EVERYONE
WHY IS HE ACTING THIS WAY
THE SON SHOWS HIM THE FAILING MATH GRADE AND THE FATHER SAYS UHH OUCH WOW
PEOPLE ARE THINKING WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS KID
TRY TO COMFORT HIM THERE
I STILL LOVE YOU
AND WHILE WORKING WITH HER I STARTED TO REALIZE THAT SELF COMPASSION OFFERED A LOT OF BENEFITS THAT
LET ME START BY DEFINING WHAT I MEAN BY SELF ESTEEM
WE FEEL LOUSY WE FEEL TERRIBLE ABOUT OURSELVES
THEY ARE MORE CONFIDENT
MAKE IT IN ANY ONE OF FIVE FOCUS AREAS
WHEN I ARRIVED I GOT TO EAT ALL OF MY FAVORITE FOODS
THE TWO OF US WOULD SPEND HOURS TRYING TO PUT IT TOGETHER WHILE WE CHATTED COMFORTABLY
THEIR REASONS WERE VARIED BUT THEIR REASONS WERE VERY REAL
THEY NEEDED WHAT THOSE WOMEN COULD BRING TO THE TABLE
BUT WHY DOES THE EARTH GO AROUND THE SUN
BUT IF YOU'RE ANYTHING LIKE ME YOU'LL WANT TO SEE SOME OF THAT FOR YOURSELF SO LET ME SHOW YOU
AND SO I COME TO MY WISH
AND IF YOU DROP YOURSELF INTO A CONTEXT WHICH IS ALL ADULTS TALKING ABOUT STUFF OVER YOUR HEAD YOU WON'T LEARN
DO THEM ALL AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE FLUENT IN A SECOND LANGUAGE IN SIX MONTHS
WE HAD 48 HOURS TO DELIVER A TRAINING MANUAL IN CHINESE
HOW DO YOU DO THAT
COME WITH ME ON A JOURNEY THROUGH A FOREST
AND IF YOU CAN'T GET A NATIVE SPEAKER TO LOOK AT YOU CAN USE STUFF LIKE THIS
ALL IN YOUR TARGET LANGUAGE
THERE'S 20 OR 30 YEARS OF RESEARCH ON THIS STEPHEN KRASHEN A LEADER IN THE FIELD HAS PUBLISHED ALL SORTS OF THESE
SO YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO HEAR THESE SOUNDS
AND THEN SHE CAME ACROSS THESE FIVE PRINCIPLES SHE MOVED TO BRAZIL AND SHE APPLIED THEM AND IN SIX MONTHS SHE
HOW DO YOU LEARN FASTER
BUT HYPNOPAEDIA DID OPEN THE DOORS TO RESEARCH IN OTHER AREAS AND WE'VE HAD INCREDIBLE
AND I ALSO WENT IN WITH A DIFFERENT IDEA WHICH WAS
AS LEONARD COHEN SAYS THERE'S A CRACK IN EVERYTHING AND THAT'S HOW THE LIGHT GETS IN
IT WAS WHEN I WAS HONEST WITH MYSELF AND LET GO OF AN AGENDA AND STOP TRYING TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN THAT LOVE COULD
IN EXACTLY THE WAY THAT SHE DID BECAUSE THE DIFFERENCE WAS THAT SHE REALLY MEANT IT AND THEN SHE WAITED FOR MY ANSWER AND
AND THAT'S OK AND IT'S NORMAL
OTHERWISE I WAS JUST PUSHING IT AWAY
RECEIVING AND GIVING IS ACTUALLY THE EXACT SAME ACTION
I'D HEARD ABOUT A ZEN MONASTERY WHICH IS IN ENGLAND
ALL WE DID ALL DAY APART FROM GARDENING AND COOKING WAS HOURS AND HOURS
AND IT SAID I AM EXTREMELY PRECIOUS I'M LIFE ITSELF
AND IT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW
AND WHY SEVERAL SIM CARDS
THESE ARE REALITIES AND THEY ARE HORRIFIC BUT IT IS NOT THE ONLY REALITY
EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW RIGHT
MINE IS CUT OFF BECAUSE IT'S NOT VALID ANYMORE I GOT MYSELF A NEW ONE
THAT'S THE KIRPAN
YOU DID THIS TRICK
YOU GO HOME AND PUT IT ON INSTAGRAM TWITTER FACEBOOK
I'M GOING TO CHANGE THE SITUATION A LITTLE BIT
WHY DO YOU FORGET
IT COULD BE THE MOST AMAZING THING EVER
AND THAT'S WHAT WE TRY TO DO WITH MAGIC
I SNAP MY FINGERS AND YOU REACH INSIDE YOUR POCKET
I GAVE YOU SOMETHING YOU NEEDED THAT YOU WANTED THAT YOU DIDN'T REALLY EVEN THINK WAS POSSIBLE
IMAGINE YOU'RE WALKING DOWN THE STREET WITH YOUR FRIEND
BECAUSE SO WHAT
SO IN MAGIC WE CALL THIS THE HAM SANDWICH
AND THE HAM SANDWICH IS BEST EXPLAINED AS AS A STORY OR AN EXAMPLE
IMAGINE YOU PULLED OUT THIS SANDWICH
WILSON AND I REALIZED IT'S REALLY NOT
MICHAEL GELLER WOULD SAY TO JORDAN SPIETH PAINT A PICTURE
ONE OF THE TENETS IS
WILSON AND I HAVE BEEN FRIENDS FOR A LONG TIME
AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU
AND BOY DID SECRETARIAT RUN HIS RACE
BUT IF YOU DO IT YOU'LL BE SUCCESSFUL IN WHAT YOU WANT TO ACCOMPLISH
BUT GUESS WHAT
WELL HE DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE UP HOPE
NOW THERE'S A LADY THAT INSPIRED ME AND IT WAS A TREMENDOUS STORY
THE OTHER IS DELIBERATE PRACTICE
THIS IS A MORE POWERFUL TOOL THAT WE CAN USE IN OUR DAILY LIVES
HE KEPT ON GOING
THEY'RE SUPERHUMAN THESE MEN AND WOMEN
WHAT DO YOU THINK HE DID WHEN HE CAME BACK AFTER NOT TOUCHING A CLUB FOR SEVEN AND A HALF YEARS
IT'S ABOUT A COMPETITIVE MINDSET
HOW IS IT GOING TO REACT
EVEN JORDAN SPIETH THE NUMBER ONE GOLFER IN THE WORLD YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD NOW WITH TECHNOLOGY THEIR
THAT IS WHAT MAKES DELIBERATE PRACTICE SO DIFFICULT BECAUSE IT'S TEDIOUS AND PAINFUL
BEFORE I SHOT A FREE THROW I WOULD ACTUALLY AND YOU CAN TAKE THE TIME IF YOU WANT TO FOLLOW WITH ME IS
AND I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU WERE IN THAT SITUATION
THINK ABOUT HOW HARD THAT COULD BE
THEY'RE ALWAYS CREATING NEW CHALLENGES FOR THEMSELVES
BUT HE DID THIS EVERY DAY
WHAT DELIBERATE PRACTICE IS IS USING SOMETHING IN YOUR FUNDAMENTALS TO BUILD UPON
A LOT OF US WANT TO LOSE WEIGHT
AND THEN YOUR CHOICES AND YOUR DECISIONS ARE ALL BASED UPON WHAT YOU HAVE JUST DETERMINED
PUT ON THE DRESS SEE YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR
WELL WHAT HE'S SAYING IS LOOK AT THE FLIGHT OF THE BALL
AND HE SAID IT WAS LIKE A LOCOMOTIVE GOING DOWN THE BACK STRETCH AND AROUND THE
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY WINNING
SOME TWO KEY POINTS THAT WE SAW THAT MAYBE YOU COULD USE IN YOUR DAILY LIFE OR IN YOUR
LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE
HE SAID I WAS HERE FOR A RIDE
GET OUT OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE
HE WOULD FEEL THE WIND ON HIS BACK AND HE WOULD KEEP ON WALKING ALONG
IF YOU'RE GOING TO A JOB INTERVIEW VISUALIZE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE JOB INTERVIEW
THAT'S UNHEARD OF IN HORSE RACING
AND THE THIRD PART IS
I ACTUALLY HAD A FRONT ROW SEAT
AND HE'S BEEN BY MY SIDE EVER SINCE
WILSON WITH ME
THAT'S TWO SECONDS
SO THEY'RE ALWAYS BREAKING DOWN NEW BARRIERS
NO IT'S NOT ABOUT VANQUISHING AN OPPONENT
EAT THE FOOD THAT YOU NEED TO DO BECAUSE WHEN YOU COME BACK YOU'VE ALREADY CREATED AN IMPRINT OF WHAT
AND THEN I WENT ON TO COLLEGE AND OBVIOUSLY PLAYED COLLEGE BASKETBALL
HOW MANY OF YOU WANT TO LOSE WEIGHT
THEY'RE ALWAYS ABOUT WINNING
SO WHAT HE WOULD DO FOR FOUR HOURS IS PLAY HIS GOLF COURSE BACK HOME
BUT THEY WILL DO GLOBAL ECONOMIC DAMAGE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO HIT NECESSARILY TO
I DON'T THINK APOPHIS IS A PROBLEM
THE SECOND STEP IS IF WE SEE ONE HEADING TOWARD US WE HAVE TO STOP IT
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THE DINOSAUR KILLER DID
BUT WHAT'S THE SECOND STEP
RUSTY SCHWEICKART WHO WAS AN APOLLO 9 ASTRONAUT IS ON THIS
THE PROBLEM IS IF YOU HIT THIS ASTEROID YOU'VE CHANGED THE ORBIT YOU MEASURE THE ORBIT THEN YOU FIND OUT OH
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
MOVE AND THE CAR GOES PAST YOU
THAT MEANS WE CAN DO IT AGAIN
THEY'RE JUST NOT BIG ENOUGH
YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD ABOUT THE ASTEROID APOPHIS
THE EARTH'S GRAVITY IS GOING TO BEND THE ORBIT OF THIS THING SO MUCH
THERE IS A MEDIAN POINT BETWEEN TINY ROCK AND GIGANTIC ROCK AND IN FACT IF ANY OF YOU HAVE EVER BEEN TO
WHEN OUR GOVERNMENTS FRAME SLUMS AS THREATS IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY VIOLENT LAND GRABS OR FORCED EVICTIONS THEY'RE COUNTING ON THOSE
IN FACT HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETES ARE THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO SUSTAIN CATASTROPHIC INJURIES
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I'VE COME UP WITH
GIRLS HATE BUGS LOVE HUGS AND ARE BETTER AT VACUUMING RUGS
DOES ME HAVING A BEARD MAKE MY SALMON PANTS LESS GIRLY
AND GENDER CHANGES OVER TIME
TRUCKS AND SOLDIERS AND LEGOS ARE THEIR TOYS BUT THEY BREAK THEM ALL
TWO OPTIONS TO DESCRIBE EVERY PERSON IN THIS ROOM EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU
LET'S PUT THIS ALL TOGETHER
BUT YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING TO
AND WE HAVE TIME TO DO THAT
AWAPUHI GINGER LEAVE IN CONDITIONER FACIAL SCRUB FULL BODY WASH
YOU CAN'T SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT GENDER
NOW I KNOW THAT THAT WAS NUMBER ONE
BECAUSE BOYS WILL BE BOYS
AND BASED ON THAT GUESS WE RAISE HIM TO BE A HIM OR HER TO BE A HER
HAD ANOTHER MOMENT
TODAY I'M GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT GENDER AND NOT SEXUALITY
AND I REMEMBER WATCHING MY FAMILY GO THROUGH THAT AND THINKING THAT I NEVER WANTED ANOTHER FAMILY TO FEEL
SO THAT'S WHAT WE SET OUT TO DO
AND THEN WENT ON MY NEXT SUMMER TO WORK UNDER DR
FOR EXAMPLE VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS ARE CHEMICAL POLLUTANTS THAT ARE FOUND IN OUR SCHOOLS HOMES AND
IS IT WORTH IT TO YOU
GOT REJECTED BY ALL EXCEPT ONE
WITH THIS QUESTION IN MIND I STARTED RESEARCHING AND I SOON FOUND THAT INDOOR AIR POLLUTANTS WERE THE CULPRIT
IT'S A HUGE PROBLEM
AND THIS TIME THEY NO LONGER RESPOND TO THE DRUG
BECAUSE I REALIZED THAT IF WE COULD FIND A WAY TO TARGET REMEDIATION WE COULD ALSO FIND A WAY TO
BUT I WANT EVERYONE HERE TO REIMAGINE A WORLD WHERE INSTEAD OF PRESCRIBING STEROIDS INHALERS AND
IT WAS ABOUT FINDING MY PASSION
AND THAT IS WHERE THE RESEARCH BEGAN
SOUNDS GREAT RIGHT
BECAUSE REMEMBER WE SPEND 90 PERCENT OF OUR LIVES INDOORS
BUT THAT WAS ME YEARS AGO
AND I WAS LED TO IT THROUGH A SERIES OF EVENTS
AND LATER IN BIOLOGY CLASS I LEARNED THAT IT'S DUE TO A PROCESS CALLED DENATURING WHICH IS WHERE THE PROTEINS WILL CHANGE
BASED ON THESE FINDINGS I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU
BUT BEFORE I END MY TALK TODAY I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH ONE SAYING
LAST YEAR ALONE WE TREATED IN ISRAEL 207000 PEOPLE
AND HE SAVED MY FATHER
COULD YOU IMAGINE HOW I FELT IN THAT MOMENT
HE COULD HAVE SAVED THIS CHILD
I WAS 17 YEARS OLD
HE WAS ON COUMADIN
THERE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE A
BUT THEY DON'T COUNT ON ME
OR FOR NOT TALKIN' BACK
AND HIS CHEEKS IS DRIPPIN' BUT NOT WITH SWEAT
HOW DILIGENTLY YOU FOLLOWED THOSE RULES SPOKE VOLUMES ABOUT THE KIND OF MARINE YOU WERE
AND I'M FRICKIN' BATMAN
AND SUDDENLY EVERYTHING GETS QUIET
IS GONNA COME BETWEEN BATMAN
AND MAYBE GET LIKE MAD FAMOUS FOR REAL
AND THE ONE GOOD FOR NOTHING LEFT STANDING GRIPS A HANDGUN AND AIMS IT STRAIGHT UP LIKE HE'S HOLDING JESUS HOSTAGE LIKE HE'S THREATENING
BUT IT'S ALSO A SERVICE
AND NOT LIKE AFRAID RESPECT JUST LIKE RESPECT RESPECT
CAUSE ALL BATMAN REALLY WANTS TO DO IS SAVE PEOPLE AND MAYBE PAY ABUELA'S BILLS ONE DAY AND DIE HAPPY
YOUR RANK SAID SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR HISTORY AND THE RESPECT YOU HAD EARNED
BUT REGARDLESS IT WAS DIFFICULT
EVERYTHING YOU DO IS EITHER STEEPED IN TRADITION OR HAS A PRACTICAL PURPOSE
YOU CAN'T SMOKE IN THE FIELD BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE AWAY YOUR POSITION
HOW LONG IS IT GOING TO TAKE YOU
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE DONE BECAUSE WE'RE ALL WORKING FOR EACH OTHER
THERE WILL BE WARS THERE WILL BE DEPRESSIONS THERE WILL BE NATURAL DISASTERS
IN THIS CASE CHIMPANZEES TEACHING EACH OTHER HOW TO CRACK NUTS WITH ROCKS
QUITE A LONG TIME
THEY'RE ALWAYS MADE FROM LOCAL CHERT
FOR EXAMPLE IN THE CAUCASUS THERE'S A SITE WHERE YOU FIND LOCAL NEANDERTHAL TOOLS
WITH LANGUAGE WE HAVE TO TRANSFER IDEAS THAT WE UNDERSTAND WITH EACH OTHER
AWFUL THINGS WILL HAPPEN IN THIS CENTURY I'M ABSOLUTELY SURE
THEY WERE IMAGINATIVE
SO THE GAINS FROM TRADE ARE ONLY GOING TO GROW
PER CAPITA FOOD PRODUCTION IS UP BY A THIRD
THEY'RE BOTH EXACTLY THE SAME SIZE AND SHAPE TO AN UNCANNY DEGREE
HOMO ERECTUS MADE THE SAME TOOL FOR 30000 GENERATIONS
HOPEFULLY IT MATCHES HIS TASTE
THIS TRICK'S MORE ABOUT THE TIMING
IF YOU DON'T ATTEND TO SOMETHING YOU CAN'T BE AWARE OF IT
IF I DID IT SLOWLY IT'D BE ON YOUR SHOULDER
WE'RE JUST SHOPPING
WHAT COLOR IS MY SHIRT
EVEN MORE THAN THAT WHAT ABOUT PREDICTING HUMAN BEHAVIOR
DON'T RUN AWAY
FOR ME I LIKE TO THINK OF IT VERY SIMPLE LIKE A SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM
WHAT JUST HAPPENED
MAKE YOUR BEST GUESS
I'M GOING TO TRY TO PUSH IT INSIDE YOUR HAND
BUT IT'S ONLY A START
IF I COME DOWN I'M GOING TO DO A BIT OF SHOPPING
BRING THEM OUT CHECK AND SEE HOW ACCURATE YOU WERE
PUT YOUR HAND UP A LITTLE BIT HIGHER BUT WATCH IT CLOSE
DO YOU HAVE A WALLET
LET'S ASK THAT MOM TO READ THE LETTER
THERE'S ALSO A WEATHER GODDESS WHO CONTROLS A RANDOM STOCK MARKET AND RANDOM WEATHER
WE HAVE A LETTER IN THE GAME
AND WE'D COME IN FROM PLAYING HE'D COME IN FROM PLOWING AND WORKING AND WE'D SIT AROUND THAT TABLE EVERY NIGHT
EVERYBODY UNDERSTOOD THAT WHEN WE LOSE SOMEBODY THE WINNERS ARE NOT GLOATING
THERE'S A WORLD BANK ARMS DEALERS AND A UNITED NATIONS
I DID A ROUGH ESTIMATE OF HOW MANY DAYS I SPENT COMMUTING TO MY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN STOCKHOLM
IF WE KEEP DESIGNING AND BUILDING AS IF THE PLANET HAD UNLIMITED RESOURCES WE WILL
I CAN'T CHANGE THE PAST I CAN'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT I WAS SEXUALLY ABUSED AS A CHILD
I RESENTED THE PART OF ME THAT WAS IN PAIN
HOLDING FOUR YEAR OLD SASHA'S HAND FELT SO GOOD I'VE DECIDED TO DIRECT A FEATURE LENGTH
I WANTED TO SHARE MY STORY WITH THE WORLD AND PUSH FOR A CONVERSATION THAT I FELT OUR SOCIETY WAS STRUGGLING TO
MAYBE SOME OF YOU HAVE RECEIVED AN EMAIL THAT SAYS SOMETHING LIKE HI I'M A NIGERIAN BANKER
OKAY I'M A LUCKY GUY I WILL ENTER THE BAR AND FIND THE BEST SPOT FOR THAT
OKAY I GOT LUCKY
HOW ABOUT THE INVESTOR
WELL REMEMBER THAT THE LUCK IS WITHIN YOUR CONTROL
BUFFETT A GUY NEXT TO HIM
WHAT IS TRUE THAT AMBIDEXTROUS PEOPLE OR PEOPLE WHO USE BOTH HANDS FOR DIFFERENT TASKS ARE MORE
THE PEOPLE WHO PREFERRED MOZART MUSIC TO THE STORIES GOT A BIGGER I
QUITE A FEW PEOPLE THERE
AND THEY PLAYED THE PEOPLE THE MUSIC OR THE STORIES
FIRSTLY AND MOST CRUCIALLY THE LAB COAT WASN'T WHITE IT WAS IN FACT GREY
AND ONE THING YOU MIGHT THINK ABOUT DOING IS PUNISHING PEOPLE FOR THEIR MISSES AND SEEING IF THAT IMPROVES THEM
BOOST FROM THE MOZART THAN THE STORIES BUT THE PEOPLE WHO PREFERRED THE STORIES TO THE MOZART MUSIC GOT A BIGGER I
A FAMOUS STUDY SURVEYED PEOPLE FROM 37 DIFFERENT CULTURES ACROSS THE GLOBE FROM AMERICANS TO ZULUS ON WHAT THEY
IF YOU THINK THEY'RE FIGHTING YOU'RE A BIT MORE OF A NASTY AGGRESSIVE PERSON
ONE TO FIVE PERCENT OF WHAT WE DO IS CONSCIOUS
IS THAT CRAZY
AND YOU CAN'T CHANGE YOUR PAST NONE OF US CAN CHANGE OUR PAST
WE ARE ATTRACTED TO AND TEND TO CHOOSE PEOPLE WHO WOUND US IN A SIMILAR WAY AS A PARENT WHO WOUNDED
AND THE FIRST QUESTION WAS
IF SHE LEFT YOU TOMORROW WOULD YOU BE OKAY
SOUTH AFRICA WAS A COUNTRY WHERE I MADE MY FIRST MY ONLY BEST FRIEND AND IN ADDITION TO THE FRIENDS I
AND WHILE MUCH OF MY SENSE OF HAPPINESS CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE FACT THAT I AM A MOTIVATED AND OPTIMISTIC
OUR FAMILY HAD TO RUN
WE MUST REALIZE ALL LIVING THINGS HAVE A PURPOSE AND THAT EVEN THOUGH WE MAY NOT UNDERSTAND THAT PURPOSE
HER NAME WAS ALLIE
BECAUSE THEIR PURPOSES ARE DIFFERENT THAN OURS WE MIGHT TREAT THEM AS A LITTLE LESS IMPORTANT
SO I WANT YOU TO TAKE A MOMENT AND ASK YOURSELF
I TOLD HER TO STOP
CHILDREN DON'T NEED A STRESS FREE LIFE
THE PARADOX IS THAT MORE THAN ANYTHING IN OUR LIVES WE WANT OUR CHILDREN TO
AND A TRACTOR RIDE IT WAS
JUST RECENTLY I COUNSELED A MOTHER WHO WAS COOKING THREE DIFFERENT DISHES FOR HER THREE CHILDREN
I HAVE FOUR
WHEN WE DECIDE TO RUN A MARATHON WE DON'T RUN 42 KILOMETERS ON OUR FIRST
AND IT IS MY MOTIVATION TO NEVER GIVE UP
THIS IS MY MEMORY OF MY FATHER AND MY
AN EXPERIENCE OF UNCONDITIONAL LOVE
I HAVE COME TO BELIEVE IT'S THE ONE THING WORTH LIVING FOR
THERE IS NO PERFECT DAY OR MOMENT TO COME
CHILDREN WHO ARE EXPOSED TO CHRONIC STRESS ARE PRONE TO MENTAL PROBLEMS SUCH AS
HE COULD HAVE MADE ME
SHE WAS EXHAUSTED AND SHE FELT UNAPPRECIATED
ON ONE REALLY HOT SUMMER DAY ON A CAMPUS A PROSPECTIVE FAMILY WAS BEING WALKED
BUT I ALSO HAVE MOMENTS THAT DON'T MAKE ME PROUD OF MYSELF
ON THE WAY TO SCHOOL SHE SAT IN THE BACK IN THE CAR AND INSTEAD OF BEING THE HAPPY
WHERE WAS THE MOST OBVIOUS PLACE
MY BLOOD SUGAR CRASHED
YOU CAN WANT IT MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD
I WAS GOING IN AND DEALING WITH DANGEROUS CHEMICALS HAVING NOT EATEN FOR ALMOST 24 HOURS
SO I STAYED ILL
HOW I DIDN'T HARM MYSELF OR SOMEBODY ELSE I HAVE NO IDEA
EVERY EATING DISORDER IS DIFFERENT FROM THE WAY THEY START AND HOW THEY PRESENT THEMSELVES TO THE RULES THAT GOVERN THEM
FIVE HOUR LABS WERE UNBEARABLE
BE AWARE OF THOSE UNDERSTAND THOSE EFFECTS AND TAKE RESPONSABILITY FOR YOUR ACTIONS TOWARD OTHERS
WHEN WE ARE HUNGRY WE CAN GO TO THE REFRIGERATOR AND GET A SNACK
OR YOU MAY HAVE REALISED ALREADY OF COURSE THAT THESE BOTH MAY BE SELF EVIDENT TRUTHS BUT THEY CAN'T
ALL OF THESE ARE VARIATIONS ON THE EXPERIENCE OF LONELINESS
NOT LONG AGO WE THOUGHT ABOUT THE GENES AS THE KEYBOARD ON WHICH LIFE'S SONG PLAYED OUT
NEVER MIND THE FACT THAT I WAS 14
I WILL CONTINUE
SO NO MATTER THAT I HAVE INHIBITIONS TO FILL ALL MY POCKETS I KEEP TRYING HOPING THAT ONE DAY I'LL
AS A WAY TO ENCOURAGE MY FRIENDS TO DO SPOKEN WORD WITH ME
I WILL KEEP COMING BACK WEEK AFTER WEEK
WHEN I MEET YOU IN THAT MOMENT I'M NO LONGER A PART OF YOUR FUTURE
I DISCOVERED THIS BAR ON MANHATTAN'S LOWER EAST SIDE THAT HOSTED A WEEKLY POETRY OPEN MIC AND MY
BUT THAT SPRING THERE WERE NEW BUDS POPPING UP FROM THE EARTH
I CAN DO THIS
I'M ALWAYS TRYING TO FIND THE BEST WAY TO TELL EACH STORY
AND I SAID CHARLOTTE IT SOUNDS PRETTY INTERESTING TO ME
I ASKED HER WHAT THAT MEANT AND SHE SAID MISS IT'S KIND OF A LONG STORY
BUT I TEACH SPOKEN WORD POETRY BECAUSE IT'S ACCESSIBLE
AND STEP THREE BEGAN WHEN I REALIZED I DIDN'T HAVE TO WRITE INDIGNANT POEMS IF THAT'S NOT WHAT I WAS
AFTER THE A BOMB SPECIALISTS SAID IT WOULD TAKE 75 YEARS FOR THE RADIATION DAMAGED SOIL OF HIROSHIMA
I LOVE SPOKEN WORD
BUT PHIL AND I DECIDED TO REINVENT PROJECT V
AND THAT WAS THANKS TO A GIRL IN A HOODIE
AND I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT MY BEGINNING WAS AT THE BOWERY POETRY CLUB BUT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT IT WAS MUCH EARLIER
BUT IN THAT INSTANT I GET TO SHARE YOUR PRESENT
IN FACT THEY WELCOMED ME
THE ONLY RULE IS DON'T THINK TOO HARD
SO I DECIDED TO GIVE IT A TRY
IMPOSSIBLE IS TRYING TO CONNECT IN THIS WORLD TRYING TO HOLD ONTO OTHERS WHILE THINGS ARE BLOWING UP AROUND YOU
I SPENT A LOT OF TIME THINKING ABOUT THE BEST WAY TO TELL THIS STORY AND I WONDERED IF THE BEST WAY WAS GOING TO BE A POWERPOINT A SHORT
I DIDN'T ALLOW THEM TO KNOW
THEIR STORIES RESONATE DEEP INSIDE OF ME AND I'M REASSURED THAT WE AREN'T SO ALONE IN THIS WORLD
I FIRST MET VITALY IN THE SPRING OF LAST YEAR
I WAS NOT GOING TO STAY IN MY OFFICE I WAS NOT GOING TO DELEGATE MY WORK AND I
SO I ASSEMBLED A TOP NOTCH LEADERSHIP TEAM WHO BELIEVED IN THE POSSIBILITY OF ALL THE CHILDREN
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO ABOUT IT
PERSON A HAS TO MAKE A SUGGESTION AND THAT SUGGESTION CANNOT BE CONSTRAINED BY REALITY
IT WAS JUST A PERFECT TINY MOMENT OF ABSOLUTE EQUALITY
ONE OF THE SCHOOLS THAT WAS INVOLVED IN THAT IS A MONASTERY SCHOOL
COME WITH ME
AND NUMBER TWO IS THAT THAT CREATIVE URGE THAT URGE JUST TO DROP ALL THE CULTURAL
A LOT OF THE PARENTS OF THESE CHILDREN LIVE IN SLUMS WHICH IS UNOFFICIAL
SO SOME OF THEM ARE RESIDENTIAL
IT MIGHT BE THAT THEY ARE FROM A VERY RURAL AREA WHERE THERE IS NO STATE SCHOOL
OFTEN THE CHILDREN IF THERE'S NO SCHOOL THEY GET SENT AWAY TO A MONASTERY SCHOOL
WHO'S IN THE RIGHT
WHO'S A BADDIE
I USED TO WORK AT SHAKESPEARE'S GLOBE THEATRE
GIRLS NOW HAVE A PEER GROUP THAT CAN SUPPORT THEM AS THEY GO THROUGH THEIR CAREER
GIRLS ARE OPEN TOO
I DON'T KNOW WHY IT IS THERE ARE SOME REASONS OUT THERE WE NEED TO CHANGE BUT I WANT YOU ALL TO THINK ABOUT HOW YOU CAN HELP THAT CHANGE
BUT IF YOU LOOK IN YOUR HANDS OR IN YOUR LAPS OR IN YOUR HANDBAGS I BET YOU'VE GOT A PHONE OR A LAPTOP OR A
HOW COOL IS THAT
THEY'VE HAD A TASTE OF CODE AND REALIZED THIS IS SOMETHING THEY WANT TO DO MORE OF
FIRST AND FOREMOST IS INFRASTRUCTURE
I SEE IT EVERY DAY
SO WHAT HAS RWANDA SAID
AND ABOVE ALL WE HAVE TO ENGAGE OUR YOUNG PEOPLE
DO YOU FIND A WAY TO STAY ON AND FIGHT BACK
OUR MANUFACTURING VALUE ADDED IS ONLY 11 PERCENT
THE THIRD THING WAS LOSS MAKING ENTERPRISES
IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE
THERE ARE A FEW PLACES IN THE WORLD ARE REALLY GOOD AT KEEPING THEM ALIVE
AND COMPANIES KNOW THIS
AND COMPUTER NETWORKING WHICH SPAWNED COMPANIES LIKE 3 COM AND CISCO AND MADE THE INTERNET POSSIBLE
AND YOU SEE THIS TODAY
AND HE COLLECTED MANY THINGS INCLUDING HIS FAMOUS FINCHES
IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF THE GENIUS OF HENRY FORD OR KARL BENZ OR EVEN ELON MUSK
WHY SHOULD BE BELIEVE THE SCIENCE
HOW CAN WE KNOW WHAT'S CAUSING THE OBSERVED WARMING
WHY DO CARS WORK SO WELL
SO WHY IS THAT
WE CAN ALSO THINK OF SCIENCE AS BEING A KIND OF A JURY EXCEPT IT'S A VERY SPECIAL KIND OF JURY
MOST OF US TRUST OUR CARS
WELL IN HINDSIGHT WE CAN SAY THAT ASTRONOMERS WERE MAKING TWO AUXILIARY HYPOTHESES BOTH OF WHICH WE WOULD NOW
SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT A GEOLOGIST CAN'T TELL YOU WHETHER A VACCINE IS SAFE
THIS WAS A HUGE CONFIRMATION OF THE THEORY
SO NOMOLOGICAL MEANS HAVING TO DO WITH LAWS
AND I DIDN'T CHECK FACEBOOK
HOW CAN WE KEEP OURSELVES TO OUR PROMISE OF CONSTANTLY REIMAGINING EDUCATION
AND SO IN MANY WAYS I BELIEVE THAT THE NEXT BIG QUANTUM LEAP IN SCIENCE
ON OUR 8TH DAY WE WOKE TO GUNSHOTS HUNTERS I THOUGHT
MY SISTER WAS 6 I WAS TWO AND A HALF AND STILL IN DIAPERS AND WE WERE SLEEPING IN A SNOW CAVE DEEP IN
I WAS AWARE OF EVERY SOUND EVERY MOVEMENT
WHAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE
BUT THIS WAS ALSO THE END OF A 7 YEAR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DAWN WALL
WE KEEP DOING IT
MY GIRLFRIEND AND I WITH 2 FRIENDS HAD HELICOPTERED INTO A REMOTE MOUNTAIN REGION IN SOUTHWEST KYRGYZSTAN
AS IT GOT DARK 2 OF OUR CAPTORS FORCED US TO DROP EVERYTHING AND RUN WITH THEM
I NOTICED MY NIGHT VISION IMPROVING
SO THIS HAS BECOME THE MANTRA OF MY RESEARCH GROUP AT MIT
BY DOING THIS WE CAN MEET THE NEEDS OF THE 2
WITH THESE TWO PRODUCTS
WE FOUNDED A SOCIAL ENTERPRISE CALLED GRIT AND WE STARTED TO SHIFT OUR FOCUS FROM THE ENGINEERING AND DESIGN OF OUR
AND IF WE CAN DO THAT EVERYBODY WINS
AND DOWN AT THE OTHER HAND THERE'S LOW COST WHEELCHAIRS BUT THEY'RE HARD TO PROPEL IN ROUGH TERRAIN AND THEY BREAK DOWN PRETTY
WE SHIPPED THE CHAIRS OVER WE HAD A LOT OF FUN GETTING PEOPLE ROLLING AROUND
IT WAS AN EASY FIX WE WERE ABLE TO SWAP OUT THE TUBES AND VALVES BUT WE'RE SURE GLAD THAT WE LEARNED THAT LESSON WITH 20 CHAIRS
INITIALLY OUR FOCUS HAD BEEN ON THE WORK WE WERE DOING IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
SECOND AND THIRD ORDERLY EFFECTS WHICH WILL LEAD TO MORE HUMAN ELABORATE COLLABORATION
WE ALLOW ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL STRUCTURES ADJUST FAST ENOUGH TO THIS NEW REALITY
THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS
THEY WERE SENT ALL OVER THE STATES TO WORK IN HAWAII PINEAPPLE PLANTATIONS AND WASHINGTON APPLE ORCHARDS AND ANYWHERE THE WORK WAS
AND FOR POPULATIONS LIKE THESE THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS TOO OFTEN PART OF THE PROBLEM RATHER THAN THE
THEY'RE MIGRANTS PEOPLE OF COLOR
I HAD CALLED HER MY AUNTIE
IF THOSE WORKERS RUN AWAY THEY RISK BECOMING PART OF THE GREAT MASS OF UNDOCUMENTED
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE
THESE ARE WELL MEANING DOCTORS SOME OF THEM HAVE GONE ON TO BECOME VERY GOOD FRIENDS
WELL WE HAVE TWO OBJECTIVE MEASURES
YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T DO THAT
YOU KNOW IT ALL
WE CAN DO IT
AND THEY JUST KEEP GOING THROUGH ALL THESE THINGS
SHOW US LET US SIGN
I ASKED HIM WHY
I AM CONVINCED THAT AFRICA'S FURTHER TRANSFORMATION AFRICA'S ADVANCEMENT RESTS
IN THE FEW CASES WHERE THIS HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN AFRICA THERE HAS BEEN REMARKABLE SUCCESSES RECORDED
2 MILLION CASES
YOU OWN THE KNOWLEDGE
AND SO IT BOTHERED ME
YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH EXPERTS
WE KNOW OUR AIM
SO I SENT IT TO A WEBSITE
BUT THE FEEDBACK HAS BEEN QUITE TREMENDOUS
SO I WANTED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THIS WORLD SO I STARTED READING THE SILMARILLION
AND SO I DID
THE EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF WORK THAT TOLKIEN PUT INTO CREATING THE WORLD OF MIDDLE EARTH AND UNFORTUNATELY
AND IT HAS PROFOUNDLY CHANGED ME AS A PERSON
BUT I WOULD OFTEN DRIFT OFF IN MIND IMAGINING BEING ON SOME GRAND ADVENTURE WITH ARAGORN OR GANDALF
SORT OF LIKE A SIDEKICK I WASN'T THE MAIN CHARACTER
THE BRIDGE TEAM CONSISTS OF AN ACADEMIC COORDINATOR WHO HAS THE WEIRDEST TASTE IN MUSIC LIKE THIS GUY IS EITHER LISTENING TO BOB
SADNESS IS AN EMOTION THAT COMES AND GOES JUST AS HAPPINESS DOES
IT'S TIME TO FIGHT BACK
I ASKED MYSELF WHY I HAD IGNORED WHAT WAS GOING ON IN MY HEAD FOR SO LONG SIMPLY TO MAINTAIN THIS
THOUGH I COULD GO ON I'M NOT HERE TO SIMPLY TELL YOU ALL ABOUT MY STORY
IS IT JUST A COINCIDENCE THAT SCHOOL SYSTEMS AND STANDARDIZED TESTS ARE GETTING HARDER AND COLLEGE ACCEPTANCE RATES ARE GOING
OFTENTIMES CONVERSATIONS REGARDING MENTAL ILLNESSES SUCH AS DEPRESSION RESULT IN WORDS BEING THROWN AROUND THAT
YOU HAD TO GO TO CLASS
AND NOW WE HAVE A NEW EXPERIMENTAL PREP HUMAN BEINGS
THE OTHER AREA IS CALLED BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS
DRUGS OF ABUSE WOULD COME IN AND THEY WOULD CHANGE THE WAY YOU VALUE THE WORLD
HERE'S THE COOL THING
EVERYONE IS INTERESTED IN OTHER PEOPLE
EVERYONE HAS RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND THEY'RE INTERESTED IN THESE RELATIONSHIPS FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS
WHY IS THAT
THEY KEEP YOU ALIVE
THESE SAME VALUATION SYSTEMS ARE REDEPLOYED WHEN WE'RE VALUING INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER PEOPLE
AND WE CAN USE THAT TO SORT OF CARVE UP THE BEHAVIOR
IT WAS AT THE TIME IN HOUSTON TEXAS
THIS IS THE KIND OF GAME DONE BY MY LAB AND MANY AROUND THE WORLD
AND WE STEAL THEIR GAMES
NO OTHER SPECIES CAN DO THAT
THAT IS WE EXPLOIT THE FACT THAT THE HEALTHY PARTNER PLAYING SOMEBODY WITH MAJOR DEPRESSION OR PLAYING
YOU COULDN'T DO HEALTHY PEOPLE
OKAY SO WHAT
THIS HAS LITERALLY REVOLUTIONIZED COGNITIVE SCIENCE
IT'S IN ITS EARLY STAGES AND IT'S CRUDE BY SOME MEASURES BUT IN FACT 20 YEARS AGO WE WERE AT NOTHING
THAT'S AN UNFAIR OFFER AND YOU KNOW WHAT AN UNFAIR OFFER IS
AND IT TURNS OUT THAT WE HAVE A RELIABLE COMPUTER MODEL FOR THAT
IT'S AMAZING THAT YOU CAN MAKE A CFD SIMULATION OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF WATER
AND ALSO FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE BUILDING YOU CAN CALL IT A SOCIAL INNOVATION BECAUSE THE INDOOR
THAT CAN BE DONE
WILL PEOPLE LIKE NATURAL AIR CONDITIONING
WELL MOST PROBABLY YES
EARTH WIND AND FIRE
ARCHITECTS DISLIKE AIRCONDITIONING IN FACT
COULD WE LEARN FROM THEM AND BUILD A BUILDING IN REALITY
THERE MAY POSSIBLY BE A THIRD ALTERNATIVE
I CAN SEE IT
AND HE IS WORTHY OF AN ENTIRE TALK ON HIS OWN RIGHT
THEY MIGHT BE A BIT EXAGGERATED
WELL YES I DO
WE EACH HAVE TWO ASPECTS TO OUR FACE
OH SHOULD I ASK THEM
SO IN THE AGE OF TRANSPARENCY THAT WE LIVE IN THE INTERNAL AND THE EXTERNAL REALITY OF WHAT A COMPANY
SO IF DIVERSITY IS A PRIORITY IT SHOWS UP IN THE BOTTOM LINE
I WILL NEVER FORGET THE RECOVERY PERIOD WHERE YOU MUST REMAIN COMPLETELY SILENT FOR TWO WEEKS AND WHEN YOU'RE
SO YOU CAN'T BUY THIS KIND OF ENDORSEMENT
SO NOW MORE THAN EVER COMPANIES NEED NOT ONLY DIVERSITY OF IDENTITY AND CULTURE BUT DIVERSITY OF
BUT I HAD COME TO THE EDGE OF SOMETHING MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT THAT WOULD CHANGE MY LIFE
AND REMEMBER IN THOSE DAYS I KNEW OF NO SUCCESSFUL OUT ROLE MODELS IN THE PERFORMING WORLD
AS I STARTED TO BUILD MY CAREER AS A PROFESSIONAL VOCALIST I STRUGGLED CONTINUALLY WITH VOCAL
THIS IS SOMETHING FAMILIAR
SO THINGS KIND OF GO OUT OF DATE
DOES THIS IDEA SUPPORT THIS GOAL
BUT NOW IMAGINE THAT THE HEAD OF THIS NGO GOES TO THE HEAD OF THE SCHOOL EDUCATION DEPARTMENT AND SAYS HEY NOW
BUT WHAT WAS ALSO INTERESTING WAS THAT NONE OF THEM ACTUALLY SCALED
AS MY COLLEAGUES AND I LOOKED ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND ACROSS THE WORLD WE COULDN'T FIND ANOTHER EXAMPLE THAT
HAS THE TOILET BEEN MADE HAS THE MEAL BEEN SERVED
THE DEPARTMENT USED TO HAVE A PROCESS WHICH IS VERY INTERESTING
IN THE END I THINK WE DID FIND SOLUTIONS TO MANY OF THE ISSUES
ALL OF THEM WERE LIMITED TO 50 100 OR 500 SCHOOLS
AND EVEN FOR ME WHO'S LIVED IN INDIA ALL HER LIFE WALKING INTO ONE OF THESE SCHOOLS IS FAIRLY
BECAUSE IT REALLY ALLOWED US TO TAKE ALL THOSE IDEAS WHICH WERE BEING THROWN AT US AND SAY WHICH ONES WE WERE GOING TO
BY THE TIME KIDS ARE 13 OR 14 THEY TEND TO DROP OUT OF SCHOOLS
I'VE TRIED A NUMBER OF THINGS AND NOTHING SEEMS TO WORK
CAN YOU POSSIBLY HELP
SO WE PUT HIM IN THE LAB AND HE COULD START TO MAKE DRUGS
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT
I THINK YOU HAVE A CHEMISTRY LAB
THE CANCER IS GONE
WE CAN REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE
THIS WAY THE PUBLIC FOUNDATION IS OWNED BY NOBODY
WE WON'T GET ANY HELP FROM THE BIG PHARMAS
CAN WE USE IT TO MAKE A DRUG
SO WHAT IS THE BEST THING OF LIFE
I HAVE A DRUG DEVELOPER
AND THEY CAME UP WITH ALL KINDS OF IDEAS
I SAID HOW MANY OF YOU NOW GO HOME EARLIER THAN YOU USED TO
AND YOU WOULD SPECULATE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO LOVE LEGOS WOULD BUILD MORE LEGOS EVEN FOR LESS MONEY BECAUSE AFTER ALL THEY GET MORE
BUT IT TURNS OUT THEY WERE VERY UNPOPULAR
I THINK THE ANSWER IS NO
SOON AFTER I FINISHED RUNNING THIS EXPERIMENT I WENT TO TALK TO A BIG SOFTWARE COMPANY IN
ALSO IF YOU LOOK AT PRISON MOVIES SOMETIMES THE WAY THAT THE GUARDS TORTURE THE PRISONERS
SO THERE WAS NOT A REAL OPPORTUNITY FOR BIG MEANING
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO LOVE LEGOS AND SOME PEOPLE WHO DON'T
FIND OUT AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE ABOUT THE PERSON YOU ARE INTERESTED IN UNDERSTANDING
AND THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT
DO THE GOOGLE SEARCH
AND UNDERSTAND THEIR POINT OF VIEW
SO I WOULD SAY THERE IS MORE TO INTERPRETING THAN MEETS THE EYE
BUT WE STILL HAVE MORE TO DEAL WITH
I MEAN WE HAVE TO START TRANSLATING
ACTS OF VIOLENCE COMMITTED BY OR UNDER THE NAME OF THE SELF PROCLAIMED ISLAMIC STATE OF IRAQ
THEY ARE SPRINGBOARDS FOR ACTION AND THEY ARE OUR HISTORY IN PROCESS
SOME PEOPLE CONSIDER IT AN INSULT FOR SOMEONE WHO'S UNINFORMED OR UNAWARE BUT I CHOOSE TO LOOK
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW WE'D DO IT AND I DIDN'T KNOW HOW HARD IT WOULD BE ALL THE CHALLENGES WE'D RUN INTO BUT I WAS DETERMINED TO PROVE HIM WRONG
HIS VISION LED TO HIS SUCCESS
IN THE EARLY DAYS I REMEMBER WE WERE ONLY ABOUT 20 PEOPLE AND I TOLD ONE OF MY GOOD FRIENDS THAT IN A YEAR WE'D BE 50 PEOPLE
FIND AN AUDACIOUS GOAL FOR YOURSELF AND FORGET ABOUT ALL THE REASONS WHY NOT
THE MASS OF ITS BODY AND THE SIZE OF ITS WINGS SHOULD MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE
AND I WAS LUCKY TO WORK FOR SOME GREAT LEADERS WHO EMPOWERED ME TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE
I WORKED MY BUTT OFF AND WE GREW OUR TEAM
BUT SIR EDMUND HILLARY DID NOT CLIMB MOUNT EVEREST ALONE
THESE INNOVATORS ALSO SHARED THREE VERY IMPORTANT TRAITS
WHEN HE SET OUT HE DIDN'T FOCUS ON ALL THE CHALLENGES BETWEEN HIM AND THE SUMMIT
SIR EDMUND HILLARY PICTURED HIMSELF HOLDING THE FLAG OF HIS COUNTRY ON THE HIGHEST POINT IN THE WORLD
SO I WANTED TO TAKE A MINUTE TO LOOK BACK BRIEFLY AT ONE OF THE STILL IMAGES FROM THE
WHAT IS THE FUTURE OF AN INTELLIGENT CIVILIZATION
WE CAN TRACK THE VERY FIRST STARS THAT FORMED IN THE FIRST FEW HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF YEARS AFTER THE UNIVERSE WAS
AND THAT REFLECTS THE LIFETIME OF THE CIVILIZATIONS THAT MIGHT BE
WE CAN TRACK THE FORMATION OF GALAXIES
AND EVEN MORE AMAZING THAN THE FACT THAT A SELF REPLICATING ORGANISM SOMEHOW CAME
HOW ADVANCED COULD VERY ADVANCE LIFE BECOME
THE LAST COUPLE OF CENTURIES HAVE BEEN A TRIUMPH OF MODERN ASTRONOMY
AND SO WHAT DO WE DO
I LEAVE YOU TODAY WITH A FINAL THOUGHT
WHEN WE ASKED WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR DOCTORS
HE GAVE ALL KINDS OF REASONS
BECOMING A DOCTOR WAS MY DREAM
WITHIN ONE WEEK OF STARTING WHO'S MY DOCTOR
THEN WE GO ONE STEP FURTHER
I HAD THIS ONE DOCTOR DR
WE GO BEYOND THE GOVERNMENT IN THE SUNSHINE ACT ABOUT DRUG COMPANY AFFILIATIONS AND WE TALK ABOUT
MAYBE THEY'LL GET IN THE NURSE'S WAY
WELL I WANTED TO BE JUST LIKE DR
MY MOTHER WAS BRAVE THOUGH AND SHE HAD HOPE
THERE'S ANOTHER SIDE TO THIS FEAR
THOSE CHILDREN WHO'LL PLAY WITH ANYTHING THEY CAN GET THEIR HANDS ON
FOR THEIR SEQUENTIAL THINKING
THE SECOND CAPACITY THAT WE SHOULD DEVELOP IN OUR CHILDREN IS A CAPACITY FOR A
JUST THE LEFT SIDE OF THEIR BRAIN
AND IT IS POSSIBLE TO INTEGRATE ART INTO THE TEACHING OF ALL SUBJECTS
THEY SLIP THE BOOK OUT OF THEIR DESK ONTO THEIR LAP AND THEY READ WHILE THE TEACHER IS TEACHING
AND THE TITLE OF THE ARTICLE SAID MIRACLE FIBER
AND THE THREE CAPACITIES THAT WE SHOULD DEVELOP IN THEM SHOULD ALIGN WITH THE THREE ESSENTIAL
SO TODAY WHITE PEOPLE CONTINUE TO CONTROL THE FLOW AND THRUST OF HISTORY WHILE TOO OFTEN TREATING BLACK
THESE TIME SPACE CLASHES BETWEEN PROTESTERS AND POLICE BETWEEN GENTRIFIERS AND
OUR LIVES ARE LIVES OF PERPETUAL URGENCY
SHOULDN'T WE GO AHEAD WITH OUR ENLIGHTENED PROGRESSIVE SELVES AND RELEGATE USELESS CONCEPTS LIKE RACE TO THE DUSTBINS OF
BUT NOW IN THE NAME OF URBAN RENEWAL AND PROGRESS THESE COMMUNITIES ARE PUSHED OUT IN SERVICE OF
SO WE TYPICALLY ARRIVE TO EVENTS 30 MINUTES EARLY
IT'S PROBABLY DRIVEN OUR CULTURE FOR MILLENNIA
WHY NOT A SELF FUELING CYCLE IN WHICH WE ALL CAN PARTICIPATE
READING AND WRITING ARE ACTUALLY RELATIVELY RECENT INVENTIONS
TEDTALKS CAN'T BE A ONE WAY PROCESS ONE TO MANY
I MEAN THIS IS THE CONNECTIVE TISSUE OF THE HUMAN SUPERORGANISM IN ACTION
IT'S NOT AS IF J
IT'S BASED ON HUNDREDS OF HOURS OF RESEARCH OF PRACTICE
THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH A TRADITIONAL SCIENTIFIC PAPER
ONE OR TWO PEOPLE SAID I HAD NO IDEA MY COUNTRY CONTRIBUTED SO MUCH
MEXICO CAN'T FIX DRUG TRAFFICKING
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN ONE COUNTRY SOONER OR LATER HAS AN IMPACT ON THINGS IN OTHER COUNTRIES
THAT'S THE 21ST CENTURY WORLD
HOW ABOUT 10 TIMES
AND SO WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY BALANCE THOSE TWO THINGS
HOW THEY GOT TO WHERE THEY ARE MAY BE IMPORTANT IN SHAPING THE INPUT INFORMATION BUT ONCE WE KNOW
AND IT MEANS THAT PEOPLE LIKE MANY OF US WHO HAVE RUN ORGANIZATIONS AND GONE OUT OF OUR WAY TO
AND SHE WAS UNUSUAL BECAUSE SHE WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN A NEW SCIENCE THE EMERGING FIELD OF
HE WAS AFRAID OF DOING DAMAGE TO THE PATIENTS HE WAS TRYING TO HELP
DID THEY EAT FISH AND CHIPS
HE SAID MY JOB IS TO PROVE DR
HE SAW HIS JOB AS CREATING CONFLICT AROUND HER THEORIES
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IN ORDER TO SEE THESE PHENOMENA COME OUT IN AN INTERVIEW TYPE SETTING DR
WE KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT OK FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND FOR MANY OTHER REASONS
BUT THE MAN WAS CONSIDERED WEAK INCOMPETENT
NEXT TIME YOU SEE A PARENT OR A TEACHER OR ANYONE INTERACTING WITH A YOUNG STUDENT THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY
IT IS LITERALLY A PHYSICALLY COMPACTING POSITION
THE REASON IT IS IMPORTANT TO CHANGE THEM IS BECAUSE WE ARE LIMITING OUR POOL OF INNOVATION BY NEARLY 50 AND WE HAVE
THEY HESITATE MORE
THEY SAY LESS
THERE ARE SO MANY WAYS THAT EACH OF YOU TODAY CAN BEGIN SOLVING THIS PROBLEM
THINK ABOUT IT NEXT TIME YOU ARE ON A HIRING COMMITTEE
THIS TIME THE RESULTS WERE REVERSED PEOPLE LIKED THE WOMAN MORE
IF THERE ARE THREE THINGS I HOPE YOU TAKE AWAY FROM THIS IT IS ONE
I THINK THIS IS WHERE THE INTERVENTION NEEDS TO BEGIN
IF YOU ARE TOLD WHAT MATTERS IS YOUR APPEARANCE AND YOU ARE OFTEN NOT RECOGNISED FOR TRYING FOR TAKING A
IS IT SOMETHING SPECIFIC ABOUT THEIR MERIT
AND THAT THEY MUST HAVE CONSEQUENCES
AS MEN AND WOMEN THERE ARE EXPECTATIONS FOR HOW WE WILL ACT IN SOCIETY IN ORDER FOR IT TO RUN
WE ARE TAUGHT THAT FROM A VERY YOUNG AGE
I CERTAINLY SIT LIKE THIS USUALLY WITH MY THIGHS OVER MY HANDS
WHY YOU DID NOT LIKE THAT APPLICANT OR WHY YOU LOVED THAT APPLICANT
I DIDN'T HAVE TO BE NICE TO PEOPLE
WELL BECAUSE WE CAN'T TRANSPORT BOOKS ACROSS BORDERS THERE HAD TO BE SEPARATE VERSIONS READ IN ALL THE
I'M GOING TO ASK THAT WE PLAY IT AT THE SPEED I READ IT
ONE IS ANOTHER AMERICAN INVENTOR TED HENTER
I SLOWED IT DOWN FOR YOU
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IN NO OTHER LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRY ARE THERE MORE THAN A COUPLE OF THOUSAND
FOR EXAMPLE AUSTRALIA LIKE ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THE WORLD'S COUNTRIES HAS COPYRIGHT
I WANT TO THANK HER TOO
CAN WE PLAY THAT ONE
MANY WEBSITES WE CAN'T READ USING JAWS AND THE OTHER TECHNOLOGIES
IT'S CALLED JAWS JOB ACCESS WITH SPEECH AND IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS
COMPUTERS HAVE CHANGED THE LIVES OF US ALL IN THIS ROOM AND AROUND THE WORLD BUT I THINK THEY'VE CHANGED THE LIVES OF WE
I LOVE STORIES
IT HAD A SPEECH SYNTHESIZER
SO WE WANTED TO STUDY IT
WE WANTED TO UNDERSTAND BETTER SO WE LAUNCHED A WISH IMPACT STUDY
THERE ARE 91 WISH RECIPIENTS AS PART OF THIS STUDY
AND UNLESS WE FIX FOR THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF SHORT TERMISM AND GET TO WHERE WE WANT TO BE
IT REQUIRES US TO PUSH INTO IT
SHORT TERMISM PREVENTS CONGRESS SORRY IF THERE'S ANYONE IN HERE FROM
IT WAS ITHACA
WHAT IS YOUR LONGPATH
AND IT ALL BEGINS REALLY WITH YOURSELF ASKING THIS
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE TOTAL CONTROL OVER
IT WASN'T ALWAYS LIKE THIS
HE WON THE PULITZER PRIZE FOR IT IN 1972
HE GOES I LOVE WHAT YOU DO
WE HAVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS THAT WE ARE FACING
IT WORKS THIS WAY
SO WE CAME UP WITH A SOLUTION TO HELP COUNTRIES ESCAPE THE MIDDLE INCOME TRAP COUNTRIES THAT ARE NOT POOR
AND WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THIS EXAMPLE IS BEYOND CHANGING THE PARADIGM OF THE TEACHER
TAKE SOMALIA FOR EXAMPLE
YOU KNOW SOME OF THEM RUN FOR OFFICE AND THEY HELPED RAISE THE STATUS OF THE PROFESSION SO THAT MORE STUDENTS
TUNISIA'S NOBEL PEACE PRIZE IN 2015 AS THE ONLY DEMOCRACY THAT EMERGED FROM THE ARAB SPRING
WHAT THIS DOES IS BASICALLY TWO THINGS
OVER 20 COUNTRIES FROM AFRICA AND ASIA HAVE COMMITTED TO MAKE EDUCATION THEIR PRIORITY AND TO
WE WILL SUBSIDIZE OR EVEN ELIMINATE COMPLETELY INTEREST PAYMENTS ON THE LOANS SO THAT
AND WE KNOW TECHNOLOGY IS NOT ALWAYS PERFECT
AND YET FILIPE IS ONE OF OVER 300000 STUDENTS THAT BENEFITED FROM THE
AND WHAT ABOUT CHILDREN IN REFUGEE CAMPS OR IN VERY REMOTE RURAL AREAS
THEY SPEND SIMILAR AMOUNTS FOR PRIMARY AND SECONDARY PUPILS AS PERCENTAGE OF GDP PER
THE SAD ANSWER IS NO
WHAT ABOUT COUNTRIES WHERE WE WON'T HAVE ENOUGH QUALIFIED TEACHERS
BUT IF I'M WALKING DOWN THE STREET I WALK PASS SOMEBODY'S HOUSE AND THERE'S THIS ROTTWEILER OUT IN THE FRONT YARD BARKING GROWLING IT'S
EVEN IF THE GOING GETS TOUGH OR WEIRD OR SCARY DON'T PANIC AND JUST KEEP SWIMMING
THAT'S THE IDEA BEHIND TRANSACTIVE MEMORY
YOU ARE ALL LIKE DORY
BECAUSE YOUR BRAIN IS MADE UP OF AROUND 21 BILLION BRAIN CELLS OR NEURONS AND THEY MAKE ALL SORTS OF
SO IF I NEED TO KNOW THIS DOCTOR WHO FACTOID OR TIDBIT I CAN ASK BEN AND THE ODDS ARE HE'LL BE ABLE TO TELL ME ABOUT
THAT'S A PERFECTLY VALID OPTION
BECAUSE ONCE YOU ACCEPT THAT KNOWLEDGE YOU CAN START TO ASK YOURSELF QUESTIONS SAY THINGS TO YOURSELF LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT
THE WHOLE REASON I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU THIS SHARING THIS INFORMATION WITH YOU TELLING YOU HOW AND WHY
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY YOU'VE CHOSEN WHICH PATH YOU WANTED TO PURSUE
I'LL EMBRACE THAT SHORT ATTENTION SPAN AND BECOME THIS MULTI TASKING MACHINE
BUT SINCE DIGITAL MEMORY HAS BECOME SO READILY AVAILABLE WE STARTED TO RELY ON COMPUTERS ON THE
IF I COPY THAT LIST OF FACTS INTO A COMPUTER FIRST I WILL REMEMBER LESS OF THEM BECAUSE BY
THEN MY BRAIN REINFORCES THE CONNECTION OH
IN 2015 IT HAD DROPPED TO 8
25 SECONDS EIGHT AND A QUARTER SECONDS
IT'S JUST THE IDEA YOUR BRAIN IS ADAPTABLE IT CAN CHANGE AND REORGANIZE ITSELF
NOW AM I SAYING OH WELL GREAT PREVENTION STRATEGY
THE CREATION OF HIGHER ELEMENTS HAPPENS WHERE CARBON IS MADE WHERE NITROGEN IS MADE
MAYBE 5 YEARS MAYBE 10 MAYBE 20 MAYBE 50 BUT OF THESE THOUSANDS OF PLANETS THAT WE'RE DISCOVERING
THEY SEE AMINO ACIDS IN STELLAR NEBULA WHERE NEW STARS ARE BEING BORN
AND YOU DID
WE'RE ONE OF MANY PLANETS IN THIS SOLAR SYSTEM
WHERE THE CALCIUM THAT'S IN YOUR BONES IS MADE
WHO PAID FOR THIS
SPACE IS ABOUT YOU AND ME AND WHERE WE CAME FROM
THERE'S A LOT ABOUT SPACE THAT KEEPS US INTERESTED
WHY DID RED BULL PAY FOR THIS
LAUGHING PAY FOR A TICKET TO GO INTO SPACE WITH THIS GUY
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S AN IDEA WORTH SHARING
THE VIDEO BEGINS AND ENDS WITH THIS MAN
WHERE NEW STAR SYSTEMS ARE BEING BORN
WHAT IS IT ABOUT SPACE
I THINK THAT'S WHY PEOPLE WANT TO BE A PART OF SPACE
OUR SYSTEM IS ONE OF MANY SYSTEMS IN THIS GALAXY
AND HE DISPLACED US FROM THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE TO JUST BE ONE OF MANY IN THE UNIVERSE SO WE COULD SEE HIM
BRUNO SAID WAIT A MINUTE
WHY ARE WE SO FASCINATED BY EVERYTHING THAT WE FIND IN THE NIGHT SKY
WITH HIS COMPANY
DOES THIS MODEL WORK
WE HAVE TO BE IMPLEMENTING THOSE SOLUTIONS RIGHT NOW
SO NINE YEARS AGO WE STARTED FRONTIERS WHICH IS AN OPEN SCIENCE PLATFORM AND TODAY ONE OF THE
IN THIS CONTEXT HAVING EFFICIENT AND OPEN ACCESS TO THE LATEST SCIENCE IS IMPORTANT
BECAUSE WE COMMIT OURSELVES TO PUBLISH ALL THE VALID SCIENCE OUT THERE THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE THAT WE ACTUALLY
IN OPEN SCIENCE EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD HAS THE RIGHT TO ACCESS THE LATEST RESEARCH
AS A NEUROSCIENTIST I SAW THESE PROBLEMS FIRST HAND
TOGETHER WITH MY HUSBAND HENRY WHO'S ALSO A NEUROSCIENTIST WE DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS
WE PROCESS DISAGREEMENT AS AN ATTACK AND GO INTO DEFENSE MODE
BUT IN THE MODERN ERA YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE A LOT OF EYEWITNESSES
AND THAT'S WHY I WANT TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE THE ROLE THE PROMOTER OF FAITH PLAYED IN THE
STUDIES SHOW THAT WE FORM AN OPINION ABOUT PEOPLE WITHIN THE FIRST SEVEN SECONDS THAT WE ENCOUNTER THEM
YOU SEE SINCE THEN I'VE EXPERIENCED OVER AND OVER HOW PEOPLE FEEL THAT A
WE GO INTO OUR REPTILE BRAINS AND WE JUST STOP THINKING
NOW THE PEOPLE WHO WERE CLAMORING FOR THIS INDIVIDUAL TO BE PROCLAIMED A SAINT
SO I THINK IN THAT SENSE YOUR EXPERIENCE HAS PERHAPS BETTER PREPARED YOU TO BE
YOUR PEERS ARE ALWAYS ONLINE WATCHING AND RESPONDING
WE ARE JUDGING PEOPLE EVERY SECOND OF THE DAY
HOW DO YOU GAIN THE FREEDOM TO SPEAK SOMETHING WITHOUT FEAR THAT SOMEONE'S GOING TO IMMEDIATELY REJECT IT OR REJECT
BY THE 1960S THE CHURCH NEEDED TO MODERNIZE AND POPE JOHN XXIII CONVENED
WELL IN MY OPINION I THINK YOU NEED ADVOCACY IN ORDER TO EFFECTIVELY
AND EVENTUALLY THE CHURCH CAME TO RECOGNIZE SAINTS AS MORE THAN JUST PEOPLE WORTHY OF
SO EVENTUALLY THE ROLE OF THE PROSECUTOR WAS DEVELOPED
CHANGE CAN ONLY HAPPEN WHEN SOMEONE IS WILLING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION AND CAN BE HEARD
AND I THINK THAT WE'RE HAVING A SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT COLLEGE EXPERIENCE BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF
WE WERE JUST A LOT MORE NAIVE
I JUST THINK THAT MY GENERATION'S LACK OF EXPERIENCE IN MANAGING OUR REPUTATIONS
BUT MY VERY CANDID SUITEMATE IN THAT MOMENT SAID SOMETHING THAT WAS GUARANTEED TO PLEASE NO ONE AND I'M
NOW THE POSTULATOR'S PRIMARY ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITY WAS TO SEEK OUT ALL EVIDENCE IN FAVOR OF
AND IT'S BEEN REALLY QUITE AN INTERESTING TIME FOR ME TO MEET UP WITH OTHER SCIENTISTS WHO COME IN AND TALK ABOUT
WHAT'S THE PROCESS BY WHICH THAT COULD HAPPEN
AND MAKE A BREATHABLE FUTURE
HOWEVER PARTICIPANTS IN THIS EXPERIMENT WERE NOT EXPLICITLY TOLD THAT THEIR BRAINS WOULD
IS IT ACCEPTABLE TO ALTER A HUMAN BEING AND SUPPOSEDLY IMPROVE THEM IF IT GOES AGAINST THEIR
THIS YOUNG MAN WAS NONE OTHER THAN ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL
THE FIRST PHONE CALL
THERE ARE ROBOTS THAT DO YOUR VACUUMING FOR YOU AND CARS THAT WILL SOON BE ABLE TO SELF DRIVE
DIVERSITY IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF OUR WORLD AND WITH DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS COME DIFFERENT
SO WHY DON'T WE TRY IT NOW
ALRIGHT MY FRIENDS
ALRIGHT ARE YOU READY
THIS IS CALLED FORMAL MEDITATION
AND NOT TO MENTION AL GORE'S INCONVENIENT TRUTH IN 2006 THAT ADDRESSED TO THE WORLD WITH FACTUAL IPCC
ALL OF THIS IS GREAT
IT HELPS US TO RAISE AWARENESS
THAT'S WHY I HAVE DECIDED TO HAVE NO CONTRACTS WITH MY CURRENT TEAM MEMBERS
I'M QUITE SURE SOMEWHERE IN THERE IT ALSO HAD PEOPLE'S KEYSTROKES PER MINUTE AND TOILET
THOSE ARE THE SEVEN SILVER BULLETS THAT I FOUND
HE'S AN AUDIO ENGINEER
WE HAVE SOMETHING CALLED THE VESTIBULO OCULAR REFLEX TO TRACK THINGS WITH OUR EYES LIKE THIS
WELL HECK YEAH IT DOES
YOU CAN DO THAT
I CAN MOVE MY HEAD
I CAN TRACK YOU
SO THIS IS ME TODAY
SO I AM THAT GERMAN PERSON
WHEN SHE LIVED WITH US IT WAS ACTUALLY THE FIRST TIME OF HER LIFE THAT SHE HAD BEEN ABROAD AND INDEPENDENT OF HER
BUT RATHER THAN TELL YOU THE WHOLE STORY ABOUT THESE TWO MOVEMENTS I JUST WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU FOUR
IN ONE HIGHLY VIEWED EPISODE A SOAP OPERA LEAD ACTRESS WAS KILLED BY A STRAY BULLET
THERE ARE MANY GREAT MODELS
IT WORKED OUT FOR ERIC THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING
HE SAID AS A KID
BUT OUR MINDS ARE STILL HYPNOTIZED BY THEM AND WE HAVE TO DISENTHRALL OURSELVES OF SOME OF THEM
EVERYBODY WHO'S SPOKEN AT TED HAS TOLD US IMPLICITLY OR SOMETIMES EXPLICITLY A DIFFERENT STORY THAT LIFE IS
IT WAS IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE CLASS AND I FELT DREADFUL
BUT IT'S WHAT I WANTED AND AS SOON AS I LEFT SCHOOL I APPLIED TO THE FIRE SERVICE AND I WAS ACCEPTED
I DON'T MEAN THEY CAN'T THEY JUST OFTEN CHOOSE NOT TO
THEY GET NO GREAT PLEASURE FROM WHAT THEY DO
IN FACT ON THE CONTRARY I THINK IT'S STILL TRUE OF A MINORITY OF PEOPLE
CAN WE PUT YOURS ONLINE
IN FACT I ASKED ESRAF
IT TURNS OUT THEY CAN AND THEY DO IT QUITE WELL
HE'S ALSO FEELING VIBRATIONS IN HIS CANE WHEN TAPPING ON THE STREET TO FOLLOW THE SIDEWALK
THAT'S THE IMPORTANT THING TO KEEP IN MIND BECAUSE REMEMBER
THERE'S NOTHING THAT WOULD SUGGEST THAT THIS WAS DONE BY A BLIND PERSON
YOU USE THE INFORMATION YOU GATHER FROM YOUR SIGHT TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS GATHER INFORMATION IDENTIFY LANDMARKS
I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH ONE LAST PIECE OF INFORMATION TO THIS PUZZLE
NOW CAN YOU FIND YOUR WAY AROUND
IF THESE MONSTERS CATCH YOU THEY TAKE THE JEWEL AND HIDE IT SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE MAZE
SO JUST LIKE ESREF OUR BLIND PAINTER WHO WAS USING HIS VISUAL BRAIN TO PAINT OUR GAMERS ARE USING THEIR
BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT IF WE CONTINUE TO DEVELOP THE RIGHT TOOLS FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE OUR MENTALITY AND
I'M NOT SAYING THAT YOU HAVE TO PLAY A GAME EVERY TIME YOU WANT TO GO SOMEWHERE BUT THE PREPS THE IDEA OF USING THE SOUNDS OR
SO WITH THIS CHALLENGE IN MINDS WE WANTED TO COME UP WITH NEW TOOLS NEW APPROACHES TO HELP BLIND PEOPLE
VIDEO GAMES TODAY ARE IMMENSELY POPULAR
SO WE ASKED ESREF TO LIE IN THE SCANNER AND MAKE A SERIES OF DRAWINGS FOR US
PLAY VIDEO GAMES
THIS IS COMPLETELY HYPOTHETICAL
PIERRE VILLEY WAS A FRENCH WRITER BLIND HIMSELF AND HE SAID
WE'LL START WITH A DEAD BODY
I WAS AT WESTERN CAROLINA UNIVERSITY AT THEIR BODY FARM MORE ACCURATELY CALLED A
WILL CHANGING THE WAY WE BURY OUR DEAD SOLVE CLIMATE CHANGE
AT THE CEMETERY ON THE DAY OF BURIAL THAT CASKET WILL BE LOWERED INTO A LARGE CONCRETE OR METAL
NO REALLY I CAN'T
FOR MANY OF US BEING SANITIZED AND BEAUTIFIED JUST DOESN'T REFLECT US
IT'S A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY AND ITS ECONOMIC MODEL IS BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF
IN A TRADITIONAL CREMATION THE ASHES THAT ARE LEFT OVER INORGANIC BONE FRAGMENTS FORM A
THE FUNERAL INDUSTRY WILL PROTECT YOUR DEAD BODY BY OFFERING TO SELL YOUR FAMILY A CASKET
I WAS THERE BECAUSE A COLLEAGUE OF MINE NAMED KATRINA SPADE IS ATTEMPTING TO CREATE A SYSTEM NOT OF
THEY'LL PUT IT IN A SUIT
THEY'LL PUT IT IN MAKEUP
IN FACT IT'S LIKELY HAPPENING RIGHT NOW AS WE SPEAK
THE GRAVES ARE SCATTERED ABOUT THE PROPERTY UNDER ELEGANT MOUNDS MARKED ONLY BY A ROCK OR A
I THINK FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE THEY'RE STARTING TO GET THE SENSE THAT OUR CURRENT FUNERAL INDUSTRY
BUT IF YOU'RE RECOMPOSED IF YOU ACTUALLY BECOME THE SOIL YOU CAN NOURISH THE TREE AND BECOME THE POST
ON THIS PARTICULAR DAY THERE WERE 12 BODIES LAID OUT IN VARIOUS STAGES OF DECOMPOSITION
WE'RE WASTING ALL OF THESE RESOURCES CONCRETES METAL HARDWOODS HIDING THEM IN VAST
THIS PROCEDURE DRAINS YOUR BLOOD AND REPLACES IT WITH A TOXIC CANCER CAUSING
THEY OFFER PUBLIC TRAILS PLACES FOR SPIRITUAL PRACTICE PLACES FOR
IT DOESN'T REFLECT WHAT WE STOOD FOR DURING OUR LIVES
SO LET'S RETURN TO THE IDEA OF PROTECTION SANITATION AND BEAUTIFICATION
IN AMERICA OUR DEATH TRADITIONS HAVE COME TO BE CHEMICAL EMBALMING FOLLOWED
ACCEPTING THE FACT THAT WE ARE ANIMALS HAS SOME POTENTIALLY TERRIFYING CONSEQUENCES
FOR THE LAST NINE YEARS I'VE WORKED IN THE FUNERAL INDUSTRY FIRST AS A CREMATORY OPERATOR
BUT IT WILL MAKE BOLD MOVES IN HOW WE SEE OURSELVES AS CITIZENS OF THIS PLANET
THE DEAD THEN BLEND SEAMLESSLY IN WITH THE LANDSCAPE
I'VE CHANGED MY MIND
COM WITHIN WEEKS OF ITS BEING CREATED IT WAS THE LARGEST GROUP
IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A CONVERSATION IN THIS WORLD YOU HAVE IT WITH ONE OTHER PERSON
EVERY TIME A NEW CONSUMER JOINS THIS MEDIA LANDSCAPE A NEW PRODUCER JOINS AS WELL
PEOPLE WERE TEXTING FROM THEIR PHONES
CHANCE HAS ITS PLAY
I WAS LOOKING FOR A TABLA PLAYER TO PLAY A GIG WITH ME THE FOLLOWING WEEK
MENDEL BUT ALSO THROUGH ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE BENGALI RENAISSANCE OR
I'VE HAD LOTS OF SITUATIONS LIKE THAT BUT I KIND OF ULTIMATELY THINK THAT THAT IS
AND I COULDN'T FIND ANYONE
I WAS ABOUT 17 I WAS PLAYING FLAMENCO GUITAR WITH HIM AND HE WAS PLAYING BEAUTIFULLY ON THE TABLA AND I JUST WONDERED WHAT HAD
SO THESE FOUR WORDS AGAIN
WITH INDIAN CLASSICAL MUSIC IT COMES FROM AN ORAL TRADITION
IT'S MUCH MORE SUBJECTIVE
IT HAS SPONTANEOUS CREATIVITY
THE PROBLEM IS THAT WHEN OUR RANGE NARROWS THAT PRODUCES SOMETHING CALLED THE LOW POWER
THIS SHIRT OR THAT SHIRT
BUT HANNAH RILEY BOWLES AND EMILY AMANATULLAH HAVE DISCOVERED THERE'S ONE SITUATION WHERE WOMEN GET THE SAME
WELL ONE OF THE WAYS IS BE A MAMA BEAR
AND HE SAID THE LIGHTER YOUR TOUCH THE BETTER YOU BECOME AT IMPROVING AND ENRICHING YOUR
POWER COMES IN LOTS OF FORMS
I WANT TO END WITH A FEW WORDS FROM MY LATE FATHER THAT HE SPOKE AT MY TWIN BROTHER'S WEDDING
SO WE WORRIED
THIS PANT OR THAT PANT
WHAT IF I GAVE MY DAUGHTER A CHOICE
WHEN MY NIECE WAS FOUR SHE RESISTED GETTING DRESSED AND REJECTED EVERYTHING
THERE HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE TIMES IN LIFE WHEN I HAVE BEEN FOREWARNED THAT A LOW POWER PERSON
THEY SAID MY EYES LIT UP
OK THAT SHIRT
THEY BECOME MORE ASSERTIVE
HOW DO WE DO THAT
THEY SMILED A BIG BEAMING SMILE
WE HAVE VERY LITTLE LEEWAY
THE COMPANY WAS SO OFFENDED THEY LITERALLY WITHDREW THE OFFER AND MY BROTHER WAS LEFT WITH NOTHING
AND THROUGH THESE EXPERIENCES I'VE COME TO RECOGNIZE THAT EACH OF US HAVE SOMETHING CALLED A RANGE OF ACCEPTABLE
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED WITH MY WIFE AND I
AND THE ANSWERS ARE ALWAYS THE SAME
WE THINK ABOUT PIE CHARTS AND COLUMN GRAPHS AND ENDLESS POLITICIANS TALKING TO SCIENTISTS WEARING
IT MAY NOT SUPPORT THE KIND OF LIFE THAT WE'D RECOGNIZE BUT IT WILL SUPPORT SOMETHING
EIGHTY FIVE TO 95 PERCENT OF SPECIES AT THIS TIME DIE OUT AND SIMULTANEOUS TO THAT IS A
NOW THIS AIR COMES WITH AN ETHICAL DIMENSION AS WELL
WHEN WE THINK ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE WE PROBABLY DON'T THINK ABOUT GIANT
AND THEN I REMEMBER MY HIGH SCHOOL CHEMISTRY TEACHER WITH REALLY LONG SOCKS AT THE BLACKBOARD DRAWING DIAGRAMS OF
THAT'S THE HARD STUFF THAT TREES ARE MADE OF
SO TREES EFFECTIVELY INVENT THEIR OWN TRUNKS AT THIS TIME AND THEY GET REALLY BIG BIGGER AND BIGGER AND PEPPER
THAT'S A NON ZERO SUM GAME
THIS ISN'T ONLY ABOUT RELIGION
YOU BOTH FEEL YOU'VE WON
SO THEY DO UNDERSTAND THAT IF YOU WANT TO BE TREATED WELL YOU TREAT OTHER
AND IN REAL LIFE THERE ARE LOTS OF NON ZERO SUM GAMES
SO IF YOU WANT TO TAKE A PARTICULARLY HARD CASE FOR AN AMERICAN SOMEBODY IN IRAN WHO IS
GOOD THINGS HAPPEN AND IT'S GOOD FOR MUCH OF THE WORLD
AND THE STORY OF GLOBALIZATION IS LARGELY A STORY OF NON ZERO SUMNESS
THAT'S A ZERO SUM GAME
SO WE NEED TO BE AWARE OF WHAT KIND OF SIGNALS WE'RE SENDING OUT
IN A WAR TWO ALLIES ARE PLAYING A NON ZERO SUM GAME
IT'S WHY SOCIAL ORGANIZATION HAS GROWN FROM THE HUNTER GATHERER VILLAGE TO THE ANCIENT STATE THE EMPIRE AND NOW
AND IT'S GOOD TO TREAT OTHER PEOPLE WELL
IT HAPPENED THROUGH A PRINCIPLE KNOWN AS KIN SELECTION
THE BAD NEWS IS THAT THIS KIN SELECTED COMPASSION IS NATURALLY CONFINED TO THE FAMILY
SO THERE'S STILL WORK TO BE DONE
HOW IN THE WORLD COULD I SAY NO
YEAH I MEAN THIS IS A STORY OF HEROISM AND I SAID
NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT
OK THAT'S MY HOOK
ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE VERY ESSENTIAL
TAKE IT ON TO THE BATTLE OF KURUKSHETRA
WE HAVE THE CONCEPT OF DHARMA
WITH LAKSHMI I ACTUALLY TRIED TO APPROACH IT FROM THE REVERSE
IT WOULD BE A DISASTER
SO THAT'S TO BE RICH NOT TO HAVE TO WAKE UP IN THE MORNING
AND HE DID HE JUMPED BACKWARDS
I HAVE SEEN ONE OLYMPIC CEREMONY AND IT WAS AWFUL
I CAN DO THE ADVERTISING FOR THE OLYMPIC GAMES IF YOU WANT
WE HAVE GOALS FOR OUR KIDS
THE WAY THAT I DO IT IN MY LIFE
THINK ABOUT OUR KIDS
IF IT DOESN'T TELL ME SOMETHING GOOD RIGHT NOW I KNOW IF I KEEP THIS UP I'M GOING TO GET WHERE I'M GOING
IF YOU'RE FOCUSED ON YOUR GOAL YOU'LL NEVER ACHIEVE IT
SO HOW DOES THIS WORK
SO WE STARTED OUR JOURNEY
IF WE HAVE DONE THAT BUILDING YOU MIGHT HAVE GONE TO IT AND I'M PRETTY SURE YOU'VE NEVER INVITE ME TO TALK TO YOU ON THIS STAGE
WE FIGURED IT OUT
SO I HAVE A LITTLE TEST FOR YOU
YOU MAY SAY JIM I'M NOT BUYING THIS IDEA THAT YOU GET ALL THIS CUSTOM MADE STUFF
SO WHAT MIGHT THAT DIFFERENT WAY BE
AND SO WE GET THEIR APPROVAL
SO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO
AND IS THAT SOMEHOW HELP US AS A COMMUNITY OF LEARNERS WHO ARE TRYING TO SEARCH OUT AND
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S TRUE EITHER
IT'S DIFFERENT CULTURE IT'S A DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT A DIFFERENT BIOLOGICAL SENSE TO WHAT IT
IT'S THE DOORWAY OPEN TO ALL CREATIVITY INNOVATION
BUT WHEN WE DON'T ASK THAT QUESTION WHAT DO WE NORMALLY GET
WHAT HAPPENS IF I HAVE A REALLY TURBULENT FLIGHT
THIS IS JUST NEW LOOK VAM
CAN YOU SEE THE POWER IN THIS
WHAT DID YOU CHUCK
WE JUST HAVE A DIFFERENT CONTEXT WHAT WILL THE FUTURE BE FOR THESE PEOPLE
THIS IS JUST PHONY PHONY CHANGE
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT HAVE YOU EVER RENOVATED A HOUSE
WHAT CAN WE DO WITH THIS
HERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT HAVE TO CHANGE
THAT JUST MEANS THANKS FOR THE HEADS UP
I THINK PEOPLE ARE HUNGRY FOR ACTUAL ACHIEVEMENT
YOU GO YEAH YEAH YEAH
PEOPLE LIST WHAT ARE THINGS WE COULD BEFORE THE CHANGE THAT WE COULD STILL DO
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE
YOU DIDN'T FOOL ME
IF YOU SAY HERE'S WHY WE HAVE TO CHANGE
WHAT DID YOU ADD
WHAT WOULD YOU DO
IT'S HARD TO PICK THE DIFFERENCE
I NEED A GOOD PUSH AND IS THE BEST THAT COULD'VE HAPPENED TO ME
THEY'RE SICK OF BELIEVING SOMETHING THAT ISN'T REAL
WHAT WORKS IS AUTHORSHIP
WHAT DID YOU KEEP
I'M SCARED OF MATH
THERE IS A BETTER WAY
HAVE YOU NOTICED
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY
WHAT DID YOU CHANGE
PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY'RE NOT BEING CONSULTED
HE THOUGHT OF HER EVERY SECOND EVERY MINUTE EVERY HOUR
BUT I WOULDN T WANNA DEAL WITH ALL THE PAPER PEOPLE POLITICS
I MEAN THIS GIRL WAS WICKED SO HE PLUCKED UP THE COURAGE AND ASKED FOR HER DIGITS
THEY SAID HIS HEAD WAS UP IN SPACE AND THEY WOULD BRING HIM DOWN TO EARTH ESSENTIALLY HE CAME FROM NOTHING AND THAT IS WHAT HE WAS
THERE D BE A POMPOUS PAPER PARLIAMENT WHO REMAINED OUT OF TOUCH AND WHO IGNORED THE PEOPLE'S PROTESTS ABOUT ALL THE PAPER CUTS THEN
AND THOUGH AT THE TIME HE FELT STUPID AND DUMB FOR TRYING TO LOVE A GIRL CONTROLLED BY HER STUPID MUM HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN COMFORTED BY THE SIMPLE SUM
I LIKE PEOPLE
MAYBE POP UP PURPLE PAPER PEOPLE
THEY D BE PURPLE PAPER PEOPLE
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE
YES THE SUNSHINE KID WAS BRIGHT WITH A WARM PERSONALITY AND INSIDE HE BURNED
PEOPLE WHO GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO MAKE YOUR LIFE BETTER AND EXPECT NOTHING IN RETURN
IN THE END HE WAS ONLY READY ONE MINUTE EARLY BUT IT DIDN T MATTER BECAUSE SHE ARRIVED ONE MINUTE LATE
AND WHAT IT ALSO MEANS IS YOU CAN WIN
PEOPLE WHO ARE CAPABLE OF GENUINE FORGIVENESS
A LITTLE PAPER ME
AND IN A POP UP POPULATION PEOPLE S PROBLEMS POP UP TOO
WHO EVERY SINGLE DAY SINCE I WAS BORN HAVE TAKEN TIME OUT OF THEIR MORNING TO PRAY FOR ME
HE PLANTED HIS FIRST TREE IN 1958
BUT THAT'S JUST THE NATURAL FLAVOR OF THAT BEAN
FORESTERO GROWN IN A COUPLE OF COUNTRIES MOSTLY WEST AFRICA AND SENT TO INDUSTRIAL CHOCOLATE
COCOA IS THEIR MAIN EXPORT SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM THAT THEY GET A GOOD PRICE FOR THEIR
THESE BIG BUSINESSES HAVE LEFT HIM BY THE WAYSIDE TAKEN A LOT OF HIS KNOWLEDGE FROM WHAT I CAN TELL
THREE US DOLLARS ROUGHLY
SO WE'VE NOT ADDED ANYTHING TO IT
ALL THESE INCREDIBLE FLAVORS THAT I HAD NO IDEA EXISTED IN CHOCOLATE
THIS IS THE BASE OF WHAT WE MAKE A GREAT CHOCOLATE BAR FROM
LOOK FOR AND SPREAD THE STORY BEHIND THE STORY
I THINK YOU AND I
WE HAVE THE POWER
SO I SUGGEST TO YOU
PEOPLE ARE WAKING UP ACROSS THE PLANET
THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE
SO NUMBER ONE
THEY'RE TRYING BUT THEY CAN'T DO IT
WE HAVE TO CHANGE
AND WE MUST CHANGE THAT
SO THERE'D BE TWO PEOPLE ON THE BUNKS AND TWO PEOPLE ON THE FLOOR ONE WITH NOWHERE TO GO EXCEPT RIGHT NEXT TO THE FILTHY TOILET
THEY CALLED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO SEE IF I WAS ON ANY WATCH LISTS
HE WAS HAPPY TO SHOW IT TO ME
BUT THAT'S WHAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE DOING TO PEOPLE WHO ARE POOR
THEY RIFLED THROUGH MY BACKPACK
THEY PATTED ME DOWN
MIDDLE EASTERN MALE WITH A BACKPACK
I LOOK AT THE CHEMISTRY OF THE OCEAN IN THE PAST
AND HE GAVE HIS KIDS A COMMUNICATION PROJECT
WE'VE HAD THEM BEFORE
BECAUSE THEN THEY MIGHT HAVE TO STOP FOR A MOMENT AND THINK ABOUT IT AND YOU'RE GOING TO GET A MUCH MORE
SCOTT PECK SAID THAT TRUE LISTENING REQUIRES A SETTING ASIDE OF ONESELF
I TALK TO PEOPLE THAT I LIKE
SHE WON A PULITZER PRIZE
NOW PEOPLE ON THE RADIO ESPECIALLY ON NPR ARE MUCH MORE AWARE THAT THEY'RE GOING ON THE RECORD AND SO THEY'RE MORE
SO I HAVE 10 BASIC RULES
ALL EXPERIENCES ARE INDIVIDUAL
IF THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THE TROUBLE THEY'RE HAVING AT WORK DON'T TELL THEM ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU HATE YOUR JOB
IF YOU WANT TO STATE YOUR OPINION WITHOUT ANY OPPORTUNITY FOR RESPONSE OR ARGUMENT
AND MANY OF THEM ALMOST MOST OF THEM ARE MORE LIKELY TO TEXT THEIR FRIENDS THAN THEY ARE TO TALK TO THEM FACE TO
DON'T THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE FOR DINNER
AND HE SAID THIS I CAME TO REALIZE
THE KIND OF CONVERSATION WHERE YOU WALK AWAY FEELING ENGAGED AND INSPIRED OR WHERE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'VE MADE A REAL
LEARN TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITHOUT WASTING YOUR TIME WITHOUT GETTING BORED AND PLEASE GOD WITHOUT
AND WE DO THE EXACT SAME THING
SO I WANT YOU TO FORGET ALL OF THAT
STEPHEN COVEY SAID IT VERY BEAUTIFULLY
THERE IS NO REASON WHY MOST OF YOUR INTERACTIONS CAN'T BE LIKE THAT
NUMBER ONE DON'T MULTITASK
WE'VE HEARD INTERVIEWS OFTEN IN WHICH A GUEST IS TALKING FOR SEVERAL MINUTES AND THEN THE HOST COMES BACK IN AND
LEAVE THEM OUT
DON'T THINK ABOUT YOUR ARGUMENT YOU HAD WITH YOUR BOSS
THEY DON'T CARE
YES I WAS VERY ANGRY
ERR ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION
THEY'RE THE ONES THAT KNOW
WE KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
I'M THE CENTER OF ATTENTION
I TALK TO PEOPLE THAT I DON'T LIKE
I TALK TO SOME PEOPLE THAT I DISAGREE WITH DEEPLY ON A PERSONAL LEVEL
SOMEBODY ASKED STEPHEN HAWKING ONCE WHAT HIS IQ WAS AND HE SAID I HAVE NO IDEA
THAT MEANS THOUGHTS WILL COME INTO YOUR MIND AND YOU NEED TO LET THEM GO OUT OF YOUR MIND
I MEAN BE PRESENT
THE FAMED THERAPIST M
WHAT THEY CARE ABOUT IS YOU
IT WAS WRITTEN BY A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER NAMED PAUL BARNWELL
NUMBER SIX DON'T EQUATE YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH THEIRS
AND WE MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHERE TO LIVE WHO TO MARRY AND EVEN WHO OUR FRIENDS ARE GOING TO BE BASED ON WHAT WE
IT'S NOT THE SAME
SO OUR MINDS ARE FILLING IN THOSE OTHER 275 WORDS
TRY ASKING THEM THINGS LIKE WHAT WAS THAT LIKE
A CONVERSATION REQUIRES A BALANCE BETWEEN TALKING AND LISTENING AND SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY WE LOST THAT BALANCE
ARE NOT SAFE EITHER
IT IS NEVER THE SAME
AND I DON'T MEAN JUST SET DOWN YOUR CELL PHONE OR YOUR TABLET OR YOUR CAR KEYS OR WHATEVER IS IN YOUR HAND
WE INDUCE CELLS OKAY SAY SKIN CELLS BY ADDING A FEW GENES TO THEM CULTURING THEM AND THEN
SO WITHOUT THE CONTROVERSY THAT'S COOL THING NUMBER ONE
OH YOU WANT ME TO PLAY THIS
LET'S NOT BE
WE REALLY COULD SENSE THAT THERE WAS GOING TO BE A MAJOR PROGRESSIVE CHANGE IN GREECE
OUR DEMOCRACIES ARE WEAKENED IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY WITH PLAYERS THAT CAN EVADE LAWS EVADE TAXES
YET I HAVE COME TO BELIEVE THAT THE PROBLEM IS NOT SO MUCH ONE OF ECONOMICS AS IT IS ONE OF
WE BELIEVE THAT THAT COLLECTIVE COMMITMENT IS GIVING RISE TO A NEW KIND OF EMPLOYEE
MY SEARCH FOR THAT TOOK ME TO 11 DIFFERENT COMPANIES IN THE FIRST YEAR
KEEP THAT IN MIND
THIS MOVEMENT IS ALREADY COMPOSED OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WITH THE SHARPEST MINDS AND THE GENTLEST
WITH THE RIGHT TEMPERATURES TIMES AND CHEMICALS WE FINALLY GOT THAT SUCCESSFUL TEST RESULT SHOWING US THAT WE HAD
WE TOOK A PROBLEM THAT MANY PEOPLE SAID WAS IMPOSSIBLE AND WE MADE IT POSSIBLE AND WE PERSEVERED WHEN IT LOOKED LIKE
AND AS A RESULT STYROFOAM IS CONSIDERED A NONRENEWABLE MATERIAL BECAUSE IT IS NEITHER FEASIBLE NOR VIABLE
MY TEAM HYPOTHESIZED THAT WE COULD USE THE CARBON THAT'S ALREADY IN STYROFOAM TO CREATE ACTIVATED
SO WHY DID WE KEEP TRYING WHEN ALL THE ADULTS SAID IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
I DO NOT HAVE ANYBODY TO GO WITH
AND THOSE FIRST FEW STEPS
THIS PROGRAM IS ABOUT CONNECTING GIRLS WITH GIRLS
OR THE TOOLS OR LANGUAGE TO KNOW WHAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING
SHE HAS FRIENDS FROM ALL OVER AND DIFFERENT GROUPS NOW BECAUSE SHE KNOWS WHO SHE IS
SHE WAS IN HER
I HAVE DONE MOST OF MY LIFE
AND I KNEW IT WAS IMPORTANT
HOW COULD IT NOT BE GOOD FOR ME
SO THE CONCEPT THAT HEART FAT CAUSES HEART DISEASE IS COMPLETELY BOGUS
IT ALWAYS PREVAILS
SO AIM TO BE ON THE SIDE OF THE TRUTH
FEWER THAN 20 ARE CONSIDERED TO BE IRREDEEMABLE SOCIOPATHS
WE DO NOT PRETEND THAT THEIR CRIME NEVER HAPPENED
HERE IS WHY THIS MATTERS
TO HELP FOSTER THAT CULTURAL CHANGE I'M STARTING WITH THE CRICKET
IN THEIR DIREST ESTIMATES BEEF WILL BE PRICED LIKE CAVIAR
I CAN'T THINK OF ANOTHER FOOD SOURCE THAT COULD HAVE THIS KIND OF IMPACT ON BOTH THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE GLOBAL ECONOMY
IN MY PREVIOUS LIFE BEFORE I STARTED BITTY FOODS I WAS A TREND FORECASTER AND CONSUMER
BY THE YEAR 2050 THERE WILL BE AN ADDITIONAL 2 BILLION PEOPLE ON THE PLANET AND ECONOMISTS SAY THAT WE
ECONOMISTS SAY THAT BY THE YEAR 2050 MEAT WILL BECOME A LUXURY PRODUCT
IT'S JACKIE JOYNER KERSEE WHO IN 1984 MISSED TAKING THE GOLD IN THE HEPTATHLON BY ONE
I FEEL SO FORTUNATE THAT MY FIRST JOB WAS WORKING AT THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART ON A RETROSPECTIVE OF
ONE HELD A HALF EATEN ICE CREAM CONE IN ONE HAND AND ARROWS IN THE LEFT WITH YELLOW FLETCHING
AND THEY PASSED ME AND SMILED BUT THEY SIZED ME UP AS THEY MADE THEIR WAY TO THE TURF
SIMILAR TO HOW YOUNG KIDS HAVE ISSUES DOING THAT BUT THEY SORT IT OUT AS THEY GROW AND
AND THEY HAD THEM DO A FREE RECALL MEMORY TEST
WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO IMAGINE WHAT THAT SOLUTION IS AND USE OUR IMAGINATION TO HELP BRING IT TO
THERE'S MUCH MORE ABOUT HOW IT APPLIES TO YOU
AND WITHOUT THAT IT'S HARD TO BE ABLE TO DEFINE YOURSELF
THEY HAVE A VERY TOUGH TIME DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN REALITY AND THEIR IMAGINATION
SO FOR MOST OF US THAT'S WHAT WE THINK OF WHEN WE HEAR THE WORD IMAGINATION
AND IT'S NOT JUST A CHILDISH EXPRESSION
NEITHER THE CONCEPT OF WRITING DOWN THINGS AND PASSING IT ON FOR OTHER PEOPLE AND SPREADING INFORMATION
I WAS RECRUITED BY THE AIRFORCE ACADEMY AND AFTER FOUR YEARS WENT TO PENN STATE FOR MY MASTER'S
WE SEE A LACK OF DIVERSITY CAUSING ISSUES LIKE OSCARSSOWHITE
AS AN EXAGGERATED EXAMPLE NEARLY HALF OF THE WORLD IDENTIFIES AS FEMALE
AND I DID THAT ON AN ELITE LEVEL COMPETING FOR THE U
BUT BASED ON THE TWELVE LABELS I'VE ASSIGNED TO THEM YOU MAKE A JUDGEMENT ABOUT WHO THEY ARE YOU DECIDE WHO THEY MAY BE
AND BY OPENING THOSE DIALOGUES AND TALKING ABOUT THOSE EXPERIENCES WE ALLOW OURSELVES TO LEARN FROM THE
AND WHILE WE SHARE A COMMUNITY WITH A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WE SHARE A SUBCOMMUNITY WITH FEWER AND FEWER THE
AND TO MY KNOWLEDGE I MAY BE WRONG I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO GOT THAT MASTER'S DEGREE FROM PENN STATE
BUT HEARING HIM SAY THAT TRIGGERS A REACTION IN THAT CAVEMAN PART OF YOUR BRAIN THAT'S TRYING TO KEEP YOU SAFE AND IT MADE ME
AND IT'S NOT UNCOMMON TO HEAR PEOPLE SAY THINGS LIKE THE COLOUR OF THEIR SKIN SHOULDN'T MATTER OR I DON'T SEE GENDER
AND YET WE WOULDN'T BEGIN TO BELIEVE THEY'RE ALL THE SAME SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY IDENTIFY WITH THAT SAME LABEL
I'M HUMAN ONE OF ABOUT 7 BILLION OF US ON THIS PLANET RIGHT NOW
FOR FIVE YEARS
BECAUSE WHILE SOME TRANSGENDERED PEOPLE CHOOSE TO DO ONE OR ALL OF THESE THINGS NONE OF THEM ARE A
I GREW UP IN UPSTATE NEW YORK I WENT TO PRIVATE SCHOOL FOR MOST OF MY LIFE ON FINANCIAL AID BEFORE I TRANSFERRED TO
I DABBLED IN A LOT OF SPORTS IN MIDDLE SCHOOL BEFORE SETTLING ON FENCING AROUND 8TH GRADE
ALTHOUGH IT WASN'T WHAT YOU'D EXPECT
I FELT GALVANIZED
MY AUNT GOT OUT OF PRISON
IT WAS A COLLEGE CLASS I'D TAUGHT BEFORE ALTHOUGH NEVER IN A PRISON
THEY WERE INSPIRED BY THE RADICALS REFORMERS AND DREAMERS WE HAD READ ABOUT THROUGHOUT THE SEMESTER TO CREATE THEIR
WHEN THAT HAPPENS I THINK WE WILL HAVE MADE PRISONS A POINT OF DEPARTURE
IT SEEMED LIKE THE CYCLE WAS JUST REPEATING ITSELF
AS A TEACHER IN A PRISON YOU WON'T HAVE FANCY TECHNOLOGY AND YOU WON'T HAVE THE INTERNET
WASHINGTON FOLLOWED SUIT AND BANNED ALL STATE PUBLIC FUNDS FOR COLLEGE IN PRISON
BUT THE WOMEN IN THE PRISON HAD VERY LITTLE SAY ABOUT WHAT WENT ON WHERE THEY CURRENTLY LIVED
IT WAS A TOUGH ON CRIME PERIOD
THESE WERE THE STORIES THAT MATTERED
WHY SHOULDN'T WOMEN HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITY
I WAS TOO BUSY WORKING AS A PROFESSOR
INSTEAD THEY'RE OUT THERE IN THE WORLD
AN IMPOSING BUILDING SET OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE
WOMEN IN PRISON MIGHT BE JUST A SMALL PROPORTION OF THE TOTAL PRISON POPULATION BUT THEY ARE THE FASTEST GROWING
I KNOW THAT OVER 80 OF THE WOMEN WHO TAKE OUR COLLEGE CLASSES AT THIS PRISON ARE MOTHERS TOO
IT REALLY BOTHERED A LOT OF MY STUDENTS THAT THEY HAD TO LOOK AT A VISIBLE SYMBOL OF FREEDOM FROM BEHIND BARS
AND I REALLY BELIEVE THAT'S TRUE
TO ALL OF YOU I WOULD ASK
IT'S WORKING IN THIS PRISON AND IT CAN WORK ELSEWHERE
CAN WE IMAGINE DIFFERENTLY
I FELT LIKE I WAS DOING WHAT I'D WANTED TO DO ALL THOSE YEARS AGO WHEN I TAUGHT MY CLASS IN NEW YORK
BUT AT THE VERY TOP THEY HAD WRITTEN
TO EMPOWER WOMEN THROUGH EDUCATION
EVEN A HORTICULTURIST AND A COSMETOLOGIST WILL GO THAT MUCH FARTHER WITH A COLLEGE DEGREE
IF YOU EDUCATE A WOMAN YOU EDUCATE A NATION
TO MEN AND WOMEN IN PRISON I WOULD URGE YOU TO ASK THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE PRISON TO OFFER
AND EVEN WHEN THEY GOT OUT THEY COULD BE BARRED FROM VOTING OR HOUSING IF THEY HAD A FELONY CONVICTION
NO ONE IN MY EXTENDED AND TIGHT KNIT FAMILY SPOKE WITH MY AUNT EXCEPT FOR MY MOM
WHEN I GREW OLDER I HEARD STORIES
CAN WE IMAGINE A WORLD WHERE EVERYONE HAS THE RIGHT TO A QUALITY EDUCATION NO MATTER WHERE YOU LIVE
AND ONE WOMAN SAID IT MEANS HAVING A VOICE OR SAY IN WHAT GOES ON IN YOUR COUNTRY OR WHERE YOU LIVE
BUT WHY CAN'T YOU IMAGINE BEING A SCIENTIST OR A WRITER
THERE'S A PROVERB THAT SAYS
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
WHERE DID THAT MUSIC COME FROM
HAVE YOU SEEN HOW DIFFICULT THAT IS HOW TOUGH
THAT WAY YOU CAN ACTUALLY INCREASE THE CHANCES THAT YOUR CARS THAT YOUR CHANGE EFFORTS ARE GOING TO HAVE AN
WHAT IS DIFFICULT IS TO KEEP DOING OVER AND OVER AGAIN
LIKE THERE IS SOME MACHINE THAT DOES THAT
THAT'S THE IDEA OF CLIENT SERVER
NOW YOU UNDERSTAND BY NOW THAT MANAGING ORGANIZATIONAL FORGETTING IS DEALING WITH THE METAPHOR
I AM A HUMAN BEING
I HAVE A MIND
ORGANIZATIONS DON'T FORGET BECAUSE THEY DON'T THINK
WE LIKE THE NEW SO MUCH AND SOMETIMES WE DESPISE THE OLD THAT WE ARE UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE OLD STILL HAS
I THINK IT'S VERY FITTING FOR A BUSINESS SCHOOL TO TEACH PEOPLE WHY ORGANIZATIONS DON'T CHANGE
THINGS ARE JUST THINGS
IN FACT YOU HAVE THE MACHINE DOWN THERE
THERE IS A WHOLE STREAM OF THOUGHT THAT CALLS ABOUT THE META REALITY OF THINGS HOW THE THINGS THAT WE USE IN FACT
THIS IS A HAPPY PILLOW
WELL I WASN'T HAPPY WITH THAT EXPLANATION
AND SO RIGHT THERE I HAD TWO CHOICES
AND BECAUSE OF MY WORK I WON A GEMINI AWARD AND A CANADIAN SCREEN AWARD
IT WAS THE NEXT PORTION OF THAT SENTENCE THAT OFFERED UP THAT ROUNDHOUSE KICK STRAIGHT TO THE GUT
IT'S A QUOTE FROM MARK TWAIN
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE TO LIVE
BUT WHAT IF IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE LIKE THAT
WE WENT TO RUSSIA WE WENT TO KAZAKHSTAN
THE AVERAGE LIFE SPAN FOR THOSE WHO LIFE TO ADULTHOOD IS 30 TO 33
EVERYTHING I THOUGHT I KNEW WAS ALL OF THE SUDDEN FLIPPED UPSIDE DOWN
AT ONLY 29 YEARS OLD I'M FAR TOO AWARE THAT I ONLY HAVE SO MANY LONG
YOUR MOTHER IS GOING TO DIE
THAT BASICALLY SUMS UP MY LIFE AS IT IS TODAY
THIS DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ABOUT HIPPIES AND TREE HUGGING AND TOFU EATING BECAUSE HONESTLY
THAT'S A HALF A GRAM OF PROTEIN PER POUND OF BODY WEIGHT PER DAY TO REPAIR FOR MY TOUGH
BUT IT TAKES 850 GALLONS OF WATER TO GROW EIGHT OUNCES OF BEEF
BECAUSE THAT'S IMPORTANT
I'D LIKE TO CHALLENGE YOU TO GO MEATLESS FOR THE REST OF THE DAY
BUT THE TIDE WAS LOW AND THE SUN WAS REALLY HOT AND THE STARFISH IT SEEMED THEY WERE DOOMED
AND AFTER NOT ONE BUT TWO SUICIDE ATTEMPTS I HAD REACHED A FORK IN THE ROAD
WELL I JUST NEVER LOOKED BACK
I WAS TERRIFIED TOO
THAT IS THE WATER THAT TAKES TO WATER THOSE SOY BEANS TO GROW
AND THIS DISEASE WOULD SPREAD FROM ONE COMMUNITY TO ANOTHER
AND THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY HERE THAT HAVE BEEN PART OF THIS CAUSE
MY MOM CAME KNOCKING ONE MORNING AND SAID RAJ PACK YOUR THINGS WE HAVE TO GO
AND HELP IN THIS CASE DIDN'T COME FROM THE OUTSIDE IT ACTUALLY CAME FROM WITHIN
AND SHE'S AMAZING
YOU DON'T KNOW HER
YOU DON'T CHOOSE THE SPOKEN WORD
SHE DOESN'T KNOW THE LANGUAGE
THEY'RE ALL OVER THE WORLD
I SAID I LIKE THE BODY LANGUAGE
I LIKE THE WAY SHE SPEAKS
I SAID I CAN'T MR
THERE ARE NO CONTRACTS NO WRITTEN CONTRACTS
YOU CAN STAY WITH ME FOR 20 YEARS GO TOMORROW
THIS IS WHAT WE TEACH IN THE NIGHT SCHOOLS
IN THE EARLY 21ST CENTURY WE'RE MAKING SPACE FOR THE BIG BANG IN AMONGST WHAT WE TELL OUR CHILDREN
ON EINSTEIN'S UNIVERSE WE HAVE SPACETIME
IT WAS CRAZY
SHE WAS RESCUED OUT OF THIS SITUATION
THAT'S THE FIRST STEP
WE WEREN'T RICH WE WEREN'T POOR
IT'S JUST NOT FAIR
ARE SOLD AGAIN
AND IN THAT SPACE I SENSE MY CREATIVITY MY AUTHENTICITY AND MY OWN AGENCY
BUT ANYONE WHO'S EVER RAISED A CHILD PLAYED WITH A CHILD NURTURED A CHILD OR TAUGHT A CHILD
I AM GOING TO IMAGINE THAT IS THE SAME FOR EACH OF YOU
WE COME IN WITH THIS CAPABILITY OF BEING PRESENT WITH OURSELVES AT ALL TIMES
I WANTED TO SHARE IT WITH YOU TODAY BECAUSE THOSE ESSENTIAL THINGS ARE WHAT I'D LIKE TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT
BEING WITH OURSELVES AND BEING WITH EACH OTHER
PERHAPS YOU WILL FEEL THE SAME
THE PERSON FOLLOWING CAN ELECT TO TAKE OVER THE LEAD OR THE PERSON LEADING CAN CHOOSE TO SURRENDER IT ESSENTIALLY MAKING IT A
THE SECRET LIES IN WHAT MADE LISA SEE OUR INITIAL DEMONSTRATION AS POLITICAL
THIS DOESN'T REPRESENT HOW WE THINK TODAY
IN MOST MAINSTREAM INTERNATIONAL BALLROOM COMPETITIONS SAME SEX COUPLES ARE RARELY RECOGNIZED ON THE FLOOR AND IN MANY
AND THEN SWITCH BACK
AS YOUR MOTHER MAY HAVE SAID
THERE HAS TO BE SOMEWHERE WHERE I CAN FIT IN AND BELONG EVEN IF THE STIGMA FOLLOWED ME
I JUST RAN AND RAN AND RAN
I THOUGHT THIS WAS A MINOR UPSET IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND I THOUGHT THINGS WOULD GET BETTER INTO MIDDLE SCHOOL
PRETTY SOON MY PARENTS GOT ANNOYED WITH DRIVING BACK AND FORTH AND I HAD TO GO BACK TO MY OLD CATHOLIC SCHOOL
I THOUGHT FOR SURE I WOULD BE ABLE TO FIND AT LEAST ONE SOCIAL GROUP OUT OF 2000 KIDS
TODAY WITH CLOUD COMPUTING IT'S CHEAP AND EASY TO BUILD OPEN DATABASES FOR PEOPLE
AT THIS MOMENT I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT SIERRA LEONE
PLEASE GO DO THAT
WE EVENTUALLY FOUND LISTS OF ALL THE HEALTHCARE FACILITIES IN ALL THE COUNTRIES BUT THESE LISTS WERE GENERATED BY
WHY IS YOUR FACE LIKE THAT
IT'S BECAUSE THEY HAVE HOPE
HELL YEAH I HAVE THE DAY OFF I'LL COME
YOU GOT PEOPLE SAYING
I'VE GOT A BEAUTIFUL WIFE THEY WANT TO TEST THAT
YOU WANT TO KEEP PEOPLE OFF YOUR BACK
THAT'S THE LEVEL OF CHARACTERS I HUNG OUT WITH
YOU SEEM ANGRY
WHAT CAN I DO
GODDAMN YOU GOT ME SINKING IN QUICKSAND
MAYBE THAT'S THE PLAN AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND
GOD WILL DEAL WITH THAT
I MEAN WE DON'T USE LAWYERS I DON'T USE THE POLICE I'M FROM ANOTHER ERA WHERE IF WE GOT A PROBLEM WE'D GO
I KNOW BUT I THINK SOMEBODY IS COMING FOR ME
I LEARNED THAT IN SCHOOL THEN I DROPPED OUT HIT THE STREETS CHECKED A GRIP AND NOW I'VE GOT CLOUT
I HAD NOTHING AND I WANTED IT
MY BOYS WHO ARE IN PELICAN'S BAY CMC MY FRIENDS THE CREW I GREW UP WITH MOST GOT WHAT THE
PEOPLE LOOK AT ME TODAY THEY SAY
YOU REALLY KNOW WHO ICE T IS
50 CENT SAID IN ONE OF HIS RECORDS
THEY BELIEVE IN CRIME AND PUNISHMENT
I'VE SEEN FRIENDS CRUMBLE UNDER THE PRESSURES OF NOT DOING WELL ON A TEST AT A MATH COMPETITION
I WOULD ALSO SAY
I THANK YOU
IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY THING
THAT'S A BIG BUZZWORD RIGHT NOW
I WAS AUDITIONING FOR SOMETHING ABOUT 25 YEARS AGO AND I WAS WALKING DOWN THIS HALL AND I WAS STANDING WITH A
YOU VIBRATE WITH THE UNKNOWN
NOW I LEARNED HOW NOT TO VIBRATE WITH THE UNKNOWN AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT IN A SECOND
I BELIEVE IN YOU
WHAT ARE THE PLANETARY BOUNDARIES WITHIN WHICH WE CAN SAFELY OPERATE
NOW AS A SCIENTIST WHAT'S THE EVIDENCE FOR THIS
ALL FOR ONE
IT MAY SURPRISE YOU THAT IT'S NOT ONLY CLIMATE
AT THE AGE OF 6 HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH PDD NOS WHICH IS A CONDITION ON THE AUTISM
SO I PULLED HIM ASIDE AND WE GOT TO CHATTING
WHAT WOULD I HAVE DONE
WHEN I WAS 15 I GOT A CHANCE TO MEET A DIFFERENT BOY
I LOVE HAVING ADVENTURES BECAUSE I LOVE FEELING FREE
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SOUND MENACING
I LOVE PEOPLE WHO ARE UP FOR STUFF AND SPONTANEITY
SOME PEOPLE WANT TO GET RICH SOME WANT TO GET FAMOUS
IF ONLY SO I'M UNITED WITH BEX
THAT DOESN'T MEAN DRUNKEN TEENS VOMITING UP AND SCREAMING YOLO
AND WHEN I WAS THE FIRST WOMAN TO COMPLETE THE AMERICAN NINJA WARRIOR COURSE I WAS ON TOP OF THE WORLD
I DID IT I WEDGED MY FEET IN THERE
I AM GOING TO FIGURE A WAY TO GET WHAT I WANT
WITH YOUR HANDS ON ONE SIDE FEET ON ONE SIDE
AND IT WAS THE SAME WAY ON THE COURSE
BUT EITHER WAY I HAVE LEARNT TO MAKE IT HAPPEN
AND I JUST TRY AND THINK ABOUT IT IN SIMPLER TERMS
OF COURSE NOT
IT ALL CHARGES UP WONDERFULLY THEN YOU BRING IN AT NIGHT AND IF YOU NEED TO DO AN OPERATION AT NIGHT THE
AND WHEN WE END UP WITH TECHNOLOGY THAT WE CAN USE WITHOUT NECESSARILY ALWAYS HAVING TO REALLY MAKE IT WORK
OF COURSE SUBTITLES USUALLY TRANSLATE INTO A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE NOT INTO THE SAME LANGUAGE
AND WE GET THIS TOO IN THE SOCIAL INNOVATION SPACE
AND PEOPLE BUILD SMARTPHONE APPS FOR HEALTH CARE WORKERS ACROSS THE DEVELOPING WORLD THEY BUILD FARM MAPS THEY BUILD
FRONTLINE SMS TODAY IS USED IN ABOUT 170 COUNTRIES 20 TO 30 MILLION PEOPLE ARE BENEFITING
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
AND YOU CAN'T SEE THEM BECAUSE THERE'S A POWER CUT
PEOPLE COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS BY CHANCE AND ACCIDENTALLY
I'VE NEVER SEEN THE FILM BUT APPARENTLY IT'S A GOOD FILM
BUT IT'S A SPANISH FILM AND THEY WERE LEARNING SPANISH AT THE TIME
I DIDN'T DO ANY OF THAT
AND IN THAT PICTURE WHICH YOU CAN'T SEE I QUOTED MARTIN LUTHER KING JR
I SAID HI TO EVERY CUSTOMER THAT WALKED IN AND GAVE THEM HOLIDAY CHEERS
OK I CAN BUILD A BETTER COMPANY
WHAT I REALLY WANTED TO DO WAS LEARN AND TO CHANGE MYSELF
IT'S AS IF HE'S PUTTING ALL THE DOUBT ON THE FLOOR
IN FACT HE INVITED ME TO EXPLAIN MYSELF
THAT'S ONE VERSION
I USE MY BLOG I USE MY TALK I USE THE BOOK I JUST PUBLISHED AND I'M EVEN BUILDING
WHY DON'T YOU COME BACK IN TWO MONTHS
HE SAID WOW I CAN USE THIS
I JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE IT
BUT BEFORE HE COULD LEAVE I SAID HEY CAN I KNOW WHY
I WENT ACROSS AND KNOCKED ON CONNIE'S DOOR
HE WAS LIKE NO ONE HAS DONE THIS BEFORE
THESE PEOPLE DID NOT LET REJECTION DEFINE THEM
I SEARCHED HOW DO I OVERCOME THE FEAR OF REJECTION
IF YOU WANT TO DO THIS GO ACROSS THE STREET AND TALK TO CONNIE
SO FOR THE NEXT HOUR I WAS THE STARBUCKS GREETER
I SAW DEAD PEOPLE
AND THEN I LEARNED I COULD FULFILL MY LIFE DREAM
I DON'T WANT TO WASTE YOUR FLOWER
WHEN I REFLECT ON THOSE TWO WORDS LET ME TRY TO DO THAT
AND AS A RESULT OUR HAPPINESS
BECAUSE IT'S THERE BUT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN MIDDLE SCHOOL AND THE MOMENT I WALKED UP HERE AND WE BECOME ADULTS IT GOES
I CAN WRITE SOMETHING DOWN
AND MOST PEOPLE WHEN THEY GET THEIR FIRST TATTOO THEY HIDE IT SOMEWHERE BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO DO THAT I WANTED TO MAKE THIS MINE
I'LL TELL A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY STORY
AND I PUSH HIM FORWARD AND HE HAS TO GO ARGUE THAT GRADE WITH HIS TEACHER
AND IT WAS ONE OF THESE ILLNESSES WHERE YOU KNOW GO TO THE DOCTOR THEY TRY TREATMENT THEY TRY THIS TRY THAT NOTHING WORKS
MY MAIDEN NAME IN FRENCH IS GUERRIER FOR WARRIOR
EVERY SATURDAY HE WAS OUT THERE CUTTING THE GRASS MAKING SURE THE GUTTERS WERE CLEAN PAINTING UPKEEPING MAKING
SO HOW DO WE STAY BRAVE
AND I SAID BUT I DIDN'T LIE THIS TIME
MY DAD STOPPED ASKING
I PUSH THEM TO ADVOCATE FOR THEMSELVES
NOW THE PROBLEM IS MY BROTHERS WENT TO THE SAME SCHOOL SO I HAD TO CONVINCE THEM TO DO THE EXACT SAME THING
THINGS WERE JUST NOT GOING WELL FOR ME AT ALL
SO AFTER ABOUT A YEAR OF THAT THEY SAID OK WE'LL HAVE TO PUT YOU UP ON THE RACK AND STUFF HAS TO COME OUT AND IT'S GOING TO CHANGE THE COURSE OF
I DON'T ADVOCATE FOR MY CHILDREN
I WAS DOING WELL I WAS HEALTHY
SURROUND YOURSELF WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE BETTER THAN YOU THAT ARE STRONGER THAN YOU
IT'S ALSO ON MY RIGHT HAND BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT
THE SAME THING WITH MY 7 YEAR OLD I'M ONLY SEVEN
MY POWER LIES WITHIN MY RIGHT HAND
I HAD SOME ONE MINUSES I PUT A PLUS
AND KNOW WHEN TO BE ABLE TO SAY THAT
TO ANYONE OF YOU I COULD WALK UP AND SAY I DON'T LIKE YOUR SWEATER
AND THAT'S THE SAME THING THAT I WORK ON EVERYDAY TO TEACH OUR CHILDREN TO MOVE IT FORWARD
I WAS ALIVE
AND I DECIDED I WAS GOING TO PUT IT SOMEWHERE WHERE I CAN SEE IT EVERYDAY
AND THAT WILL HELP PROPEL YOU FORWARD
BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE VACUUMING
MY MOTHER HAD THIS VIEW GROWING UP WHICH IS AWESOME BUT WHEN YOU'RE HUNGRY IT'S NOT THAT COOL
MY FATHER LEFT I SUSPECT BECAUSE OF THIS MAN
BECAUSE YOU KNOW I THINK I THINK IT'S BECAUSE I'M BLACK
I DON'T HAVE TO ACCEPT ALL THE BAD THINGS THAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO ME
JUST LETTUCE TOMATO CUCUMBER WHATEVER
SO THAT EVERY MORNING WHEN I GOT UP I PUT A BRACELET ON OVER THAT TATTOO
I STILL WASN'T HAPPY
I WANTED TO BE AN ARCHAEOLOGIST UP UNTIL HIGH SCHOOL
THEY HAVE TO DO SCIENCE
YOU HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT INDIGENOUS PEOPLE HAVE NEVER BEEN THERE
AND IN FACT WE DISCOVERED IN THE CAVE A NEW MINERAL STRUCTURE FOR SCIENCE WHICH IS ROSSIANTONITE A PHOSPHATE
THEY HAVE A LOT OF TASKS
SO WE HAD TO USE SPECIAL PROTOCOLS TO NOT CONTAMINATE THE ENVIRONMENT WITH OUR PRESENCE AND WE TRIED ALSO TO SHARE
BUT SOON THE QUEST FOR EXPLORATION BROUGHT ME TO THE FARTHEST CORNER OF THE PLANET SEARCHING FOR NEW POTENTIAL
SO HOW CAN IT BE POSSIBLE
AND SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
BUT WHAT I HAVE LEARNED IS SOMETHING THAT IS VALUABLE FOR ALL OF US REGARDLESS OF THE WAY WE LIVE OUR LIVES
MOST OF ALL HE WAS DRIVEN BY THE FEAR OF DIVERSITY
I JUMPED STRAIGHT OUT INTO THE WATER
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO ME AFTER THAT
THE FEAR OF THE UNKNOWN
WE DRIVE THIS ROAD 20 TIMES WE PUT ALL THIS DATA INTO THE COMPUTER BRAIN
I MEAN SOME PEOPLE HAVE HAD 10 15 20 MELANOMAS REMOVED AND ARE SCARED THAT ONE MIGHT BE
IN FACT THE PACE OF INVENTION HAS GONE UP NOT GONE DOWN IN MY OPINION
IT'S BEEN CONTRACT DRAFTING
IN THE VERY FIRST STAGE IT TAKES THE VISUAL INPUT AND EXTRACTS EDGES AND RODS AND
THE LAST THING I WANT IS FOR MY AI TO HAVE CONSCIOUSNESS
IT'S GOING TO BE EVEN BETTER IN MY OPINION
AND BACK IN THE DAY I HIRED THE WORLD'S BEST SOFTWARE ENGINEERS TO FIND THE WORLD'S BEST RULES
NOW HERE COMES LITTLE SEBASTIAN WITH A LITTLE STEAM ENGINE IN HIS POCKET SAYING HEY GUYS LOOK AT THIS
IT GOES STAGE AFTER STAGE
AND THE REASON IS WE HAVE AN ARMY OF STUDENTS WHO PARTICIPATE IN COMPETITIONS
IT FEELS LIKE THERE'D BE AN INSTANT DEMAND FOR AN APP LIKE THIS RIGHT NOW THAT YOU MIGHT FREAK OUT A LOT OF PEOPLE
AND THEN HE HAD A SECOND MOMENT WHERE HE SAID WELL LET ME JUST CHECK WITH THE APP
I'M NOT OBLIGED TO USE ANY OF THOSE
AND I THINK KASPAROV WAS EXACTLY CORRECT
THAT'S WHAT IS ON MY MIND
THERE'S NO MATH ISSUE ANYMORE
AND I THINK WHAT REALLY WILL HAPPEN IS THAT WE CAN BE SUPER CREATIVE
AND IT TOOK US ONLY TWO ENGINEERS AND THREE MONTHS TO DO THIS
AND TO CONVINCE OURSELVES THAT THIS IS THE CASE WE CAPTURED AN
THE STORY GOES THAT OUR COLLABORATOR WHO IS A WORLD FAMOUS DERMATOLOGIST ONE OF THE THREE BEST APPARENTLY LOOKED AT
WE DON'T HAVE THIS MAGIC IMPLANT IN OUR BRAIN THAT GIVES US THE INFORMATION WE WANT
IT'S THE REWRITING OF CODE
IT'S A VERY SPECIFIC DOMAIN SPECIFIC FUNCTION AND THE SAME IS TRUE FOR OUR CANCER APP
THIS IS JUST TRAINED
HOW DOES MACHINE LEARNING WORK
NO PERSON CAN EVER STUDY A HUNDRED BILLION WEB PAGES
THAT'S OUR SECRET WEAPON
SO AS A RESULT THE COMPUTER CAN FIND RULES THAT EVEN PEOPLE CAN'T FIND
THAT'S PHYSICALLY NOT POSSIBLE
IT'S BEEN THE COMBINATION OF HUMAN SMARTS AND MACHINE SMARTS THAT MAKE US STRONGER
IT SEEMS PREPOSTEROUS THAT YOU WOULD INVENT THE FLUTE A TOOL THAT CREATED USELESS VIBRATIONS IN AIR
SOMETIMES PEOPLE INVENT THINGS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO STAY ALIVE OR FEED THEIR CHILDREN OR CONQUER THE
AND THAT MADE ME REALIZED WAIT A MINUTE
AND THAT BROUGHT ME BACK AGAIN TO MY CHILDHOOD
AN EVENT EXPLODING WITH OPPORTUNITY TO ACQUIRE KNOWLEDGE DEEPEN UNDERSTANDING AND TO EMOTIONALLY
BUT I KNOW WE HAVE TO START SMALL
LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF A PERSON WHOM I THINK IS ON A RIGHT TRACK
I WANT YOU TO EXPERIENCE THE FRUSTRATION OF NOT SOLVING YOUR PROBLEM OR CREATING YOUR IDEA ON THE
IN FACT I BELIEVE OUT OF ALL THE THINGS WE SHOULD BE TEACHING IN OUR SCHOOLS RIGHT NOW THE MOST IMPORTANT THING OF ALL IS
IT HAPPENS TO BE THE DEFINITION OF THE WORD EDUCATION
RATHER THEY WENT IN THE MIDST OF ONGOING STRUGGLE
THE REASON FOR THIS IS SIMPLE
AND WE START THINKING ALONG THOSE LINES
AT MY SCHOOL I TALK TO MY TEACHERS ABOUT THIS CONCEPT AND ASK THEM TO GO BACK TO THE CLASS AND TO CELEBRATE SHARE AND LEARN
HIS NAME IS EDWARD BURGER
AND DON'T WE NEED MORE OF BOTH OF THOSE IN THE WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE IN TODAY
OR HOW ABOUT THIS ONE
AND THEN I HIT HIGH SCHOOL
BUT I DON'T WANT OUR CHILDREN TO WAIT THAT LONG
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY IT'S NOT THE OPPOSITE OF SUCCESS AS MOST PEOPLE BELIEVE IT IS A KEY COMPONENT OF IT
AND WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO IS TO BRING THE UNDERGROUND DRUG MARKETS AS MUCH AS
THERE'S OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE KIDS ONE'S ADDICTED TO ALCOHOL THE OTHER ONE'S ADDICTED TO COCAINE OR HEROIN AND THEY ASK THEMSELVES THE
BUT ANYHOW WE'RE REALLY TRYING HARD TO CAPTURE THESE VALUES
OR IT CAN BE WE ASK EVERYONE WHO SIGNS UP TO COMMIT TO
THIS IS A TERM THAT WE COINED IN OUR LITTLE CO OP AND WE'RE A LITTLE DIFFERENT
AND IT'S THIS CO OPINESS THAT IS HOW WE THINK OUR CO OP IS GOING TO WORK IN HEALTH INSURANCE
I MEAN IMAGINE A HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT WAS CREATED FOR CONSUMERS
WE MIGHT EVEN GET A TEXT MESSAGE IF OUR DOCTOR WAS RUNNING LATE BECAUSE HE HAD TO GO INTO SURGERY SO THAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO SIT THERE
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE MAJOR REASONS WHY PEOPLE CAN'T GET HEALTH INSURANCE TODAY IS BECAUSE IT'S SO HARD TO AFFORD
AND SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY MEMBERS YET
AND IT MISSES THE POINT
AND IT'S ONE OF THE BEST CO OP STORIES AND THOSE ENTITIES AND CO OP BUSINESSES STILL EXIST TODAY
SO BACK TO VALUES
JAITLEY TO ANNOUNCE IT IN THE BUDGET AS DID MANY OTHER PEOPLE
THAT'S WHAT I'VE LEARNED FROM MY EXPERIENCE AND ALSO FROM A BIG IDEA THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED WHICH IS
I KNOW THAT IT'S THE ONLY ONE
IT'S BEEN DISCUSSED FOR A LONG TIME
THAT'S LOTS AND LOTS OF JOBS
I'M SURE YOU GUYS ARE AWARE OF THE TRIALS
SO FIRST THE HISTORY
IT HAD REALLY BECOME A TRUE MOVEMENT
AND SO THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT THE WEEK IS THAT IT'S NOT BASED ON ANY PLANETARY OR
AND I THINK SOMETIMES BY SYNCHRONIZING EVEN SIMPLE ACTIONS WE CAN SYNCHRONIZE OUR
SO WHAT IS IT ABOUT THIS IDEA THAT RESONATES WITH SO MANY DIFFERENT CULTURES AND
AND THAT PATTERN IS THE WEEK
AND I THINK BY DOING THAT YOU CAN JUST DRAW INSPIRATION AND FEEL PART OF A LARGER MOVEMENT THAT
AND SO WE WENT TO THE INNOVATORS AND THE LEADERS IN EACH OF THE CATEGORIES OF TYPES OF
IT'S ALREADY THERE
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE TOGETHER AT SCHOOL AND WORK AT HOME THEY CAN JOIN
SO IT'S REALLY EASY
SO MEATLESS MONDAYS ACTUALLY STARTED AS AN ACCIDENT
SO WE ALSO HAVE SOME REALLY EXCITING NEW RESEARCH THAT LOOKS AT BIG DATA ANALYSIS OF
SO I'M GOING TO DECONSTRUCT THOSE TWO WORDS AND HOPEFULLY DRAW SOME INSIGHTS THAT CAN BE
THAT'S MY BACKGROUND
I WAS AT GREY ADVERTISING FOR TWENTY YEARS
AND JUST LAST WEEK WE GOT A REQUEST FROM SOMEONE IN ZIMBABWE WHO WANTED TO START A
THEY REBUILT IT
AND THERE NO SUPERFICIAL CONVERSATIONS AS WE SHARED OUR INNERMOST THOUGHTS OUR FEARS AND OUR
THEY TOOK AN ENTIRE HOUR TO STITCH ME UP
I WANTED MY BODY BACK
AND THEN I THOUGHT WHY STOP THERE
THAT BODY IS BROKEN
YOU'RE IN A WHEELCHAIR THAT'S NORMAL
AND LITTLE GOALS KEPT ME GOING ALONG THE WAY
I HAD A NECK BRACE AND SAND BAGS ON EITHER SIDE OF MY HEAD AND I SAW MY WORLD THROUGH A MIRROR THAT WAS SUSPENDED
I HAD NO MOVEMENT IN MY LEGS
I WANTED MY OLD LIFE BACK
AND I SAID WHAT
IS THAT A PROBLEM
AND I PRACTICED MY WALKING AS MUCH AS I COULD
I WOKE UP IN INTENSIVE CARE AND THE DOCTORS WERE REALLY EXCITED THAT THE OPERATION HAD BEEN A SUCCESS BECAUSE AT THAT
SHE SAID THAT'S NICE DEAR
THEY TOOK OUT TWO OF MY BROKEN RIBS AND THEY REBUILT MY BACK L1
IN FACT I LOST ABOUT 5 LITERS OF BLOOD WHICH IS ALL SOMEONE MY SIZE WOULD ACTUALLY HOLD
I HAD AN AWARENESS OF BEING IN MY BODY BUT ALSO BEING OUT OF MY BODY SOMEWHERE ELSE WATCHING FROM ABOVE
AS WE MADE OUR WAY UP TOWARDS THE SPECTACULAR BLUE MOUNTAINS WEST OF SYDNEY IT WAS THE PERFECT
I WAS WORRIED
AND IN BOTH CASES WOMEN WOULD RISE AND FEMINISM WOULD GAIN WOMEN RIGHTS
SHE WAS NOT UNAFFECTIONATE HOWEVER
SHE WAS FIRM BUT NOT STRICT
NOW IF THE MEDIA PROJECT THESE ONE DIMENSIONAL STEREOTYPES UNFORTUNATELY AFRICAN MEN
SHE WOULD OFTEN SIT WITH HER ARMS WRAPPED AROUND ME FOR HOURS TELLING ME STORIES EVEN THOUGH HER ENGLISH WAS POOR
SHE WAS A TOUGH WOMAN AROUND WHOM EVEN THE UNRULIEST OF CHILDREN TRANSFORMED INTO BEACONS OF
BUT SHE WAS TRADITIONAL
BY CONTRAST MUCH LIKE I STILL AM TODAY I WAS WHAT JUNGIAN ANALYSTS MAY CALL AN
SHE WAS POLITE AND DID NOT LIKE TO TAKE UP TOO MUCH SPACE
BUT THE IDEA BEHIND IT IT'S LIKE A WIKIPEDIA TYPE SITE
THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT WE CAN ALL DO IN THIS ROOM
MANY WOMEN DO NOT HAVE THAT KIND OF SOCIAL SUPPORT
IT MEANS TRAINING CORRECTIONAL STAFF ON ADEQUATE WAYS OF KNOWING THAT THEIR PHYSICAL
THEY WEREN'T BLAMING THE CARDS THAT THEY WERE DEALT IN LIFE FOR THEM BEING IN PRISON
WHAT I'M GOING TO SHARE WITH YOU IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF SLIDES ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE DATA BUT DON'T FREAK OUT
SOME INMATES ARE MORE VULNERABLE THAN OTHERS AND MORE MARGINALIZED
IT ALSO MEANS UNDERSTANDING THAT NOT EVERY WOMAN'S EXPERIENCE IN THIS WORLD IS THE SAME
THEY HAVE LOTS OF SELF DEFEATING ATTITUDES
THEY WEREN'T BLAMING THE ZIP CODE THAT THEY WERE BORN INTO
DO YOU KNOW WHO THEY WERE BLAMING
USUALLY MORE OFTEN THAN NOT HER CHILDREN WILL END UP IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM OR WITH A
WHEN THEY DO IT'S OFTENTIMES IN THE CONTEXT OF A RELATIONSHIP CHARACTERIZED BY
AN INMATE IS AN INMATE IS AN INMATE NO MATTER WHAT THEY DID OR WHO THEY ARE
ON THE SURFACE THIS KIND OF CUSTODY APPROACH SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE IF WE TREAT EVERY
AND THAT'S WHY I'M PLEASED TO TELL YOU ABOUT ALL THE ATMOSPHERES STUDIED NOW AND THIS IS REALLY A FIELD OF ITS OWN
HOW ARE WE GOING TO FIND THESE PLANETS
WHY ARE YOU BOTHERING
BUT THOSE ARE NOT SMALL PLANETS LIKE EARTH
IT REMINDS ME THAT NEARLY EVERY DAY I RECEIVE AN EMAIL OR EMAILS FROM SOMEONE WITH A
SO I BROUGHT MY TWO BIOCHEMISTRY FRIENDS AND WE WENT TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT OUR CRAZY THEORY
IS THEY CAUSE AN INFLAMMATORY REACTION THAT'S VERY LOW GRADE AND THEY MAKE THOSE PEOPLE
NOW WHAT ABOUT THE BABIES AT THE HIGH END
I HOPE YOU'LL ENJOY IT SO YOU WILL FEEL LIKE WE'RE ALL PART OF THE SAME TEAM THAT'S GOING TO MAKE OUR WORLD
AND WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT THIS
HOWEVER WHAT YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW IS EPIGENETICS AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT BEFORE YOU'RE BORN
SO HERE'S THE WORD
AND THAT DOESN'T CHANGE
THE BABIES AT THE HIGH END ARE VULNERABLE BECAUSE THEY GOT TOO MUCH NUTRITION AND THAT'S ALMOST
THAT CAN BE FOR LOTS OF REASONS
THOSE BABIES ARE VERY DIFFERENT AND THEY ARE VULNERABLE FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIFE
WHY ARE THEY VULNERABLE
I WAS SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE WHO WERE ONLY NINETEEN YEARS OLD BUT THEY WERE SO OPEN
VERY FEW OF US HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE TOTALLY AND BRUTALLY HONEST WITH OURSELVES
I'M LOOKING FOR A HUSBAND
I ALSO WANTED SOMEBODY WHO NOT ONLY WANTED TWO CHILDREN BUT WAS GOING TO HAVE THE SAME ATTITUDE TOWARD PARENTING THAT I DO
WHAT WAS EVERY SINGLE POSSIBLE THING THAT I COULD THINK OF THAT I WAS LOOKING FOR IN A MATE
SO WE'RE NEARING THE END OF OUR CONVERSATION AND THE END OF DINNER AND I'VE DECIDED STEVE THE I
FOR ME THE HOBBIES THAT I HAVE ARE REALLY JUST NEW WORK PROJECTS THAT I'VE LAUNCHED
SO I DIDN'T REACH OUT TO ANY WOMAN FIRST
SO I GO BACK ONLINE NOW
WELL AS IT TURNS OUT THIS WORKED PRETTY WELL
I WANTED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAXIMIZE MY OWN PROFILE ONLINE
WELL AS IT TURNS OUT THERE IS AN ALGORITHM FOR LOVE
SO I CREATED 10 FAKE MALE PROFILES
I ALSO WANTED SOMEBODY WHO WOULD WEIGH 20 POUNDS MORE THAN ME AT ALL TIMES REGARDLESS OF WHAT I WEIGHED
I'M NOT LOOKING FOR A PEN PAL
IN FACT IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU WRITE YOURSELF
SEE THE REAL PROBLEM HERE IS THAT WHILE THE ALGORITHMS WORK JUST FINE YOU AND I DON'T WHEN CONFRONTED WITH
SO STEVE THE I
YOU'VE GOT TO DATE AROUND
GUY INVITED ME OUT TO ONE OF PHILADELPHIA'S WHITE TABLE CLOTH EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE RESTAURANTS
IT'S JUST NOT THE ONES THAT WE'RE BEING PRESENTED WITH ONLINE
SO ARE YOU A MAKER
AND THAT'S WHY HE MOVED TO MICHIGAN
AM I GOING TO GET WET
WE CREATE THINGS
AM I GOING TO GET WET
LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN PLAYING
AM I GOING TO GET WET
NO I DIDN'T GET WET
ISAAC ASIMOV POPULARIZED THIS PERSONA WITH HIS THREE LAWS OF ROBOTICS
NOW WHAT WORKED THERE
I AM ALWAYS RIGHT BEHIND YOU
HE SOLD ME TO THE MOST VIOLENT GANG IN COLUMBUS OHIO
THAT ENCOURAGED ME AND EMPOWERED ME TO THE POINT WHERE I WANTED TO
WE MIGHT REQUIRE THAT IT SHUT ITSELF DOWN IN VERY WELL SPECIFIED SITUATIONS
THE SECOND CRITERION IS THAT WE WANT THESE SYSTEMS TO INTEGRATE WITH HUMAN SOCIETY AND WITH HUMANS IN A WAY THAT
SO WE NEED A WORLDWIDE SAFETY NETWORK IN A WAY
IF WE LOOK AT IT GOING INTO THE FUTURE IF IT CONTINUES AT THE RATE THAT IT HAS BEEN GOING WITHIN THE NEXT FEW DECADES
I'D LIKE TO TRY AND GIVE YOU THE INTUITION AS TO WHY THESE SYSTEMS MIGHT BE DANGEROUS
BASED ON ITS GOAL BEING UNPLUGGED IS TOTALLY ELIMINATING ALL THE FUTURE GAMES OF CHESS THAT IT MIGHT PLAY SO
EVERY DAY I M NOTIFIED OF THE NEWS MY GENERATION IS HEADLINING AND EVERY DAY
AT SEVENTEEN WHEN I KISSED A BOY ON A FERRIS WHEEL I REALIZED IF I WAS GOING TO TELL
AND YOU NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THIS AND DO THIS
5 OF THE POPULATION BUT WE ARE 100 OF THE SOLUTION
WHY IS IT THAT EVERY TIME WE THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX WE RE TOLD TO WAIT UNTIL WE RE OLDER
IT LL DRAG YOU BY THE HAND AND SCREAM THIS IS IMPORTANT AND THIS IS IMPORTANT
I VE TURNED ON MY LIGHT SO MANY TIMES IT S NOT DARK ANYMORE
I TURNED ON MY LIGHT
AT FOURTEEN WHEN I WAS BULLIED SO BRUTALLY I STARTED PRETENDING I WAS SICK SO I WOULDN T HAVE
AS LIFE GOES ON YOU RE GOING TO FIND YOURSELF DROWNING IN THE DARKNESS EVERY SINGLE DAY
ALL YOU VE GOT TO DO IS TO TURN ON YOUR LIGHT
AND NOW HERE I AM ALMOST EIGHTEEN
THIS IS WHAT S IMPORTANT
BUT EACH TIME IS A NEW OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO TURN ON YOUR LIGHT AND MAKE THE WORLD A LITTLE BRIGHTER
WAIT UNTIL WE HAVE OUR LIFE FIGURED OUT
AQUINMAY IS NOW THE FIRST PERSON TO COME OUT IN HIS VILLAGE AS GAY BUT NOT THE LAST
THROUGH HER ADVOCACY VALERIA S SCHOOL NOW TEACHES A COURSE ABOUT WOMAN S RIGHTS AND
THE VALIDATION PROJECT CHANGED THEIR LIVES AND IT CHANGED MINE TOO
THAT'S KIND OF WHEN A LIGHT WENT OFF IN MY HEAD
DO I OR DON'T I
I WAS TOLD FIRSTHAND WHAT CAUSED ME TO BEHAVE THE WAY I DID BEFORE I COULD LUCID DREAM
FOR ME THAT INVOLVED LETTING GO OF A LOT OF THE CONSTRUCTS I HAD IN MY HEAD ABOUT WHAT IMPACT WAS AND WHERE I WOULD
THIS GUY IS AN AMERICAN
THIS IS WHAT OUR HEAD TELLS US WE NEED TO DO BUT WHAT ABOUT OUR HEART
IT COULD NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN
AND SO THE AMBASSADOR BEGAN WITH THIS INELEGANT PHRASE
WE LIVE NOW IN A WORLD OF INTERDEPENDENCE AND GLOBALIZATION
AND THE COLLECTIVE WEST
INSTEAD WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN THE U
LET ME FIRST GO TO IN FACT CHINA'S VIEWS OF THE U
AND THE REST OF THE WEST
IT NEEDED TO BE A LITTLE MORE ELEGANT A LITTLE MORE CLASSICAL SO I RENDERED IT AS FOLLOWS
SEE THOSE HANDS THERE
THE GREAT THING ABOUT LEARNING CHINESE IS THAT YOUR CHINESE TEACHER GIVES YOU A NEW NAME
SO THERE I AM IN THE EMBASSY IN BEIJING OFF TO THE GREAT HALL OF THE PEOPLE WITH OUR AMBASSADOR WHO HAD ASKED ME
IT ALLOWS US TO STORE SOME IMMEDIATE EXPERIENCES AND A LITTLE BIT OF KNOWLEDGE
SOME WILL BE DOWN TO TWO OR THREE
THINK ABOUT THINGS IN IMAGES WRITE THINGS DOWN THAT WAY
WHILE YOU'RE HANGING ON TO THEM I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO ANSWER THREE QUESTIONS
WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS SPIN THAT AROUND
WE ARE BUILT FOR IMAGES
IT'S VERY POSITIVE
THE SUPPORT MAY COME IN ASKING PEOPLE QUESTIONS GIVING THEM A SHEET OF PAPER THAT HAS AN ORGANIZATIONAL CHART ON
JUST HANG ON TO THEM
WE CAN BE IN THE MIDDLE OF A MEETING LISTEN TO SOMEBODY'S PRESENTATION EVALUATE IT DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT WE LIKE IT
SOME PEOPLE CAN HANG ON TO 10
SOME PEOPLE CAN HANG ON TO FIVE
DO I AGREE WITH THE ASSUMPTIONS
ORGANIZATION HELPS SO WE NEED TO STRUCTURE WHAT WE'RE DOING IN WAYS THAT MAKE SENSE
WE WANT TO TAKE ALL OF OUR EXISTENCE AND WRAP IT AROUND THAT NEW KNOWLEDGE AND MAKE ALL OF THESE CONNECTIONS AND IT BECOMES MORE MEANINGFUL
NOW DON'T GET ME WRONG WORKING MEMORY IS AWESOME
I WANT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH THOSE WORDS
HOW MANY PEOPLE HERE ARE STILL PRETTY SURE YOU'VE GOT ALL FIVE WORDS
EVERYTHING WE DO IS AN APPROXIMATION OF SOPHISTICATION
WE NEED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT
NOW WORKING MEMORY HAS FOUR BASIC COMPONENTS
IT'S A WAY OF PROCESSING WHAT'S GOING ON SO THAT WE CAN USE IT LATER
WE NEED TO PRACTICE
PRACTICE FOR SOME REASON BECAME A VERY NEGATIVE THING
WE ALL STARTED AS NOVICES
THIS IS JUST NUTS
AND I THINK THERE ARE SOME CASES
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT ROUGHLY
I DON'T THINK IT'S WARRANTED
IT'S EXTRAORDINARY NOW HOW MUCH REHEARSING WE DO
THEY COULDN'T BELIEVE THEY REALLY DID THINK SHE WAS MAGIC HOW SHE ACHIEVED THIS
THIS WAS JUST BECAUSE HER FEET WERE INCREDIBLY STRONG
GALS YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER
WHAT THEY'RE SAYING TENDS TO BE PRETTY MUNDANE
THEY KNOW EACH OTHER BY VOICE
SWEET SWEET I AM SO SWEET
FOR OTHERS THEY APPEAR TO BE PONDERING THE WOES OF THE WORLD
THEY REALLY AREN'T
LET'S STOP BLAMING JACKIE FOR BEING BORN POOR FOR GROWING UP POOR AND ENDING UP POOR AS THOUGH IT'S SOMEHOW
I REMEMBERED YOUR SHELTER WAS A SUCH A SAFE WARM PLACE TO STAY SHE SAID SO I THOUGHT OF YOU WHEN MY
THERE ARE FAR TOO MANY JOBS IN OUR ECONOMY THAT JUST DON'T PAY A LIVING WAGE
IF WE CONTINUE ON THIS TRAJECTORY I'M CONFIDENT WE'LL MAKE A LASTING CHANGE WITH AND FOR THIS
THEY SAID OH MY GOD WE'RE SO GLAD SHE'S PREGNANT
AND I STOPPED LIFTING WEIGHTS
I'VE BEEN A PRO FOR ALMOST 20 YEARS AND SO FOR ME IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO HOLD WOMEN UP AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT THESE YOUNG WOMEN THEY'LL COME
I HAVE THREE SISTERS
I DIDN'T LIKE IT
WERE YOU AFRAID
DON'T LIVE IN THE PAST LIVE IN THE PRESENT AND DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES IN THE FUTURE
BUT THEN YOU ALWAYS HAVE THESE CRANKY YANKEES
SHE'S TALL SHE'S FAST SHE HITS HARD LIKE ME SHE SERVES LIKE ME
YOUR BODY BRINGS MEN AND WOMEN TO THEIR KNEES
I'M REALLY INSPIRED BY MY SISTER
I LOVE MY FREEDOM
AND I WAS JUST LAUGHING AT HER
THE ONLY REASON I AM WHO I AM IS BECAUSE OF MY LOSSES AND SOME OF THEM ARE EXTREMELY PAINFUL BUT
BUT THEN AFTER I WON THE US OPEN I REALIZED THAT MY BODY HELPED ME REACH GOALS THAT I WANTED TO REACH AND
I'M ALWAYS HEALTHY
SO FOR ME I'VE ALWAYS FELT LIKE I LOVED THAT FEELING AND OBVIOUSLY I DON'T
HAVE YOU THOUGHT AM I COMING BACK
WILL I TAKE SOME TIME OFF
SO I DID THAT AND I FELT THAT TO BE THE BEST AND IF YOU WANT TO BE THE BEST YOU HAVE TO HANG
IT WAS BETTER IN PERSON I PROMISE
BUT IT WAS A GOOD MOMENT
WHEN YOU HEARD THE NEWS WERE YOU EXCITED
I WAS LIKE I'M NOT GOING TO DO THIS
BECAUSE NOW LITTLE GIRLS ARE LOOKING AT YOU SAYING I WANT TO BE LIKE THAT
THE FOURTH STAGE MEANS
THIS CAME THIS MORNING FROM A MICHELIN STAR RESTAURANT
WE NEED TO BE RESOURCEFUL WITH OUR FOOD WE NEED TO PLAN WHAT WE EAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT OURSELVES WE'RE USING THE MOST OUT OF WHAT
OUR MAIN AIM IS TO ERADICATE FOOD WASTE AND FEED HUNGRY MOUTHS
WE HAD TO BE CLEVER ABOUT OUR FOOD
I MEAN TO THIS DAY WE STILL EAT 6
WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THIS FOXP2 AND NEANDERTHALS IS THAT THEY MAY HAVE HAD FINE MOTOR CONTROL OF THEIR MOUTHS WHO
NOW THIS MAY SOUND ARROGANT OR EVEN FULL OF HUBRIS
HOW DO WE KNOW THIS
AND THAT QUESTION IS WHETHER IN THIS MODERN GLOBALIZED WORLD WE CAN REALLY AFFORD TO HAVE ALL THESE DIFFERENT
PROGRAM AT CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY
IT ALSO MEANS THERE'S NO PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE
VIDEOS CREATED WITH POPCORN BEHAVE LIKE THE WEB ITSELF DYNAMIC FULL OF LINKS AND
IT WILL BE COMPLETELY FREE AND IT WILL WORK IN ANY BROWSER
SO LET'S WATCH IT
WE'LL GO BACK AND I'LL SHOW YOU HOW WE MADE IT
BUT BOYS ARE NOT IMMUNE TO THIS EITHER
THEY HAVE LOWER SELF ESTEEM
THEY'RE MORE EASILY INFLUENCED BY PEOPLE AROUND THEM AND THEY'RE AT GREATER RISK OF DEPRESSION
WHAT WE NEED TO DO NOW IS MAP NEAR EARTH SPACE
ONE OF THE REASONS NEOWISE IS SO VALUABLE IS THAT IT SEES THE SKY IN THE THERMAL INFRARED
BUT THE JOB'S NOT DONE YET
5 BILLION KILOMETERS
SO THE NEXT TIME YOU'RE IN AN AIRPLANE SNAG A WINDOW SEAT LOOK OUT AND IMAGINE A ROCK SO ENORMOUS THAT
WE'VE REPURPOSED IT TO DISCOVER AND STUDY ASTEROIDS
I THINK THAT IS WRONG
THAT IF YOU MOVE TOWARDS DEMOCRACY IF YOU MOVE TOWARDS TAKING PART IN
IT WAS VERY CONTROVERSIAL TO SAY THREE FOUR FIVE YEARS AGO
HOW WILL WE EVER BE INTERLOCUTORS
HOW ARE WE GOING TO SOLVE CLIMATE CHANGE THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS UNLESS WE ARE ABLE TO MAKE CIVIL SOCIETY AND
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO
ALL OF A SUDDEN NGOS WERE NOT ONLY STANDING IN THE STREETS CRYING THEIR SLOGANS BUT THEY WERE TAKING THEM
AND WE STRUGGLE WITH HOW TO DEAL WITH THEM
AND SOMETIMES MILITARY INTERVENTION IS NECESSARY
WE CAN ONLY SOLVE THIS THROUGH A POLITICAL SOLUTION
EVERYBODY SEEMS TO AGREE WITH THAT
PARKING LOTS ARE AN EYESORE AND A POOR USE OF LAND IN MY OPINION BUT JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE
CALIFORNIA'S ALMOND CROP ALONE SPENT 294 MILLION IN POLLINATION SERVICES
AND ACCORDING TO A USDA REPORT IF WE USE NATIVE BEES TO SUPPLEMENT FOR SOME POLLINATION EFFORTS WE CAN
NOT ONLY IS THAT NUMBER COMPLETELY UNSUSTAINABLE BUT THE PREVIOUS YEAR 41 PER CENT
IT'S ACTUALLY GONE UP SINCE THE RELEASE OF THE DOCUMENT
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE MEAN WHEN WE SAY WE WANT JOB CREATION
THAT'S 100 MILLION KILOS A DAY
IN THIS CASE THAT'S NOT ENOUGH
WHICH IT WAS NEVER DESIGNED OR QUALIFIED FOR
TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA THE AVERAGE MARS MISSION TAKES HUNDREDS OF SCIENTISTS FOR YEARS TO
WHAT COULD YOU BUY ON THIS SUM
I'M NOT SPEAKING ABOUT ALL THE STUFF YOU KNOW
THE OLD THINGS ARE MUCH BETTER THAN THE NEW ONES
BUT ANYWAY YOU ESCAPED
YOU HAVE TO USE YOUR SENSE MEMORY TO RECONSTRUCT THE EMOTIONS AND KIND OF THINK WITH YOUR BODY TO FIND
LET'S CALL IT THE ADVENTUROUS BRAIN
MAYBE IT CAN MAKE FOR BETTER ROBOTIC TEAMMATES
IT WAS AFTER A PASSOVER SEDER
AND THIS CAME AT THE SAME TIME AS I WAS READING ABOUT THIS TREND IN COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY CALLED EMBODIED COGNITION
SO I TRIED TO MAKE A ROBOT THAT DOESN'T ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT IT'S DOING BUT IS STILL DOING IT
THE OTHER GOT MORE THE STAGE ACTOR RISK TAKER BRAIN
LET'S CALL IT THE CALCULATED BRAIN
EVERYBODY'S RIFFING OFF EACH OTHER NOBODY IS STOPPING FOR A MOMENT
THE ROBOT IS THE SAME LAMP THAT YOU SAW AND I PUT TWO BRAINS IN IT
WE DIDN'T HAVE TO COMMUNICATE VERBALLY ABOUT THIS IT ALL JUST HAPPENED
HE ACTUALLY DID THE WEASEL IN ICE AGE
SO IF YOU WANT TO FIND THE RIGHT MOTION FOR A CHARACTER DON'T THINK ABOUT IT GO USE YOUR BODY TO FIND IT
AND IN THAT SITUATION WE CAN EASILY IMAGINE ROBOTS IN THE NEAR FUTURE BEING THERE WITH US
HOW THE TECHNOLOGIES THEY USE EVERY SINGLE DAY WORK
THIS PROGRAM WILL KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO DO
IT'S ALL ABOUT LEARNING HOW TO THINK
CODING IS THE HOME ECONOMICS OF TOMORROW
THE STUDENTS THAT HAVE ACCESS TO THESE COURSES ARE NOT JUST LEARNING HOW TO CODE AND MANIPULATE TECHNOLOGY
SO THAT'S ALL I'VE GOT FOR YOU TODAY
IT WAS THE VERY DEFINITION OF ABSURD TO ME AT THAT MOMENT
AND IT'S PRETTY EXPENSIVE ACTUALLY
IT'LL GIVE ME SOMETHING TO DO WHEN I'M BORED RIGHT
AND THE PURPOSE OF THIS IS THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO AIR OUT ALL OF THIS BAD STUFF THAT'S BEEN BOTTLED UP INSIDE OF YOU AND THEN
IN FACT IT WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE BOOK
BUT THERE IS MORE TO IT
AND THEY ARE SO COOL THAT THEY HAVE EVEN DEVELOPED A HAND SIGN
OH BABE YOU LOOK SO HOT TONIGHT
I TOTALLY WANT TO BRING HER HOME WITH US
SO I MIGHT AS WELL DIVULGE SOME INFO
SO MONOGAMISH WHAT MIGHT THIS LOOK LIKE
WE ALL HAVE OUR LIMITS
HOW DO YOU SOLVE THAT PROBLEM
THAT PROBLEM IS CALLED JAMMING AND THAT'S A PROBLEM THAT PLAGUES BATS OR SHOULD PLAGUE BATS AND ALSO ANY
BUT THE QUESTION BECOMES
HOW DO I CONTROL THEIR INTERACTIONS
BUT I DON'T DO IT FROM AN ENTIRELY ENGINEERING OR MATHEMATICAL PERSPECTIVE
I WANTED TO FIND A WAY TO ALSO USE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE TO RECEIVE DATA FROM OUR
AND THE ANSWER TO THAT IS YES WE CAN
WHEN WE DO IT WE MUST DO IT WELL AND COMPETENTLY
IT SHOWS ROLE MODELS TO YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN ABOUT FITNESS AND ABOUT LIFE THAT I
SOPHISTICATED COMMUNICATIONS SWEEP
MULTIPLY THIS BY 400000 PATIENT TREATMENTS THIS PRIVATE PUBLIC COLLABORATION
WIKIPEDIA EVERY DAY IS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE INPUTTING INFORMATION
NOW WE ARE ALSO TEACHING THEM COMBAT SKILLS OF COURSE BUT I WOULD ARGUE OPEN SOURCE
WHY DO WE WANT TO BE INVOLVED
WE WILL NEED THE APPLICATION OF MILITARY FORCE
WE SEE IT IN THE CARIBBEAN
TWO TRILLION A YEAR
SO THIS CYBER SEA WHICH WE KNOW ENDLESSLY IS THE FUNDAMENTAL PIECE OF RADICAL
WELL WORKING WITH THE SAFE ORGANISMS THAT WE NORMALLY WORK WITH THE CHANCE OF AN
MY EXPERIENCE WITH DEPRESSION HAS TAUGHT ME SO MUCH IN TERMS OF HANDLING FUTURE SCENARIOS
I LOOKED PAST THE JEALOUSIES OF LIFE AND STARTED LOOKING TOWARD THE FUTURE AND TOWARD WAYS THAT I
OUR MINDS ARE POWERFUL THINGS BECAUSE THEY INFLUENCE OUR THOUGHTS
MY DEPRESSION CAME AS A RESULT OF NOT BEING READY FOR THE REALITIES OF MIDDLE SCHOOL
EVERY SINGLE DAY I RETURNED TO SCHOOL TO A PLACE THAT HAD FOSTERED SUCH
MY BED BECAME MY HIDING PLACE FROM THE WORLD
WHAT DO YOU CALL THE LEADER OF A REPUBLICAN COUNTRY
AND SO THE SENATE WON IN THE END
WITH YUNITY WE WILL NOT ONLY PROVIDE THE GROUNDBREAKING TOOLS AND KNOWLEDGE TO MAKE THE FOODSHARING SUCCESS STORY
BUT FOR EVERY PROBLEM THERE IS AT LEAST ONE SOLUTION
ONE WHICH WAS FROM PANAMA AND ANOTHER ONE WHICH WAS FROM MEXICO
IT WAS LIKE A SIGN FOR US AND THE NEXT DAY WE WENT MORE ENERGETIC AND MOTIVATED THAN EVER BEFORE TO THE
NOW I KNOW THIS SOUNDS CLICHE BUT FEW LEADERS ACTUALLY FOLLOW IT
WITH HEALTH LINKS WE INVITED DOCTORS NURSES NURSE PRACTITIONERS DIETICIANS CASE MANAGERS
REDUCE THE RISKS
OK SO YOU'VE SURVEYED YOUR ENVIRONMENT BUILT RELATIONSHIPS AND TRUST AND NOW YOU ARE THAT LONE
THEN THERE IS MAJORITY A LARGE GROUP OF PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE
WHAT MOST LEADERS DO IS MAKE A BIG MISTAKE
GO SEE WHAT IT IS LIKE IN THEIR SETTING
HAVE YOU EVER TRIED TO CHANGE SOMETHING BUT FAILED MISERABLY
IT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF SITTING BACK AND WATCHING POOLS DEVELOPING A DAM OVER TIME
IN FACT OUR TRAINING DRIVES INTO US THE PRINCIPLE OF DO NO HARM
WHY DO YOU SAY I CAN'T DO THAT
SO I DECIDED TO GO ON THE RIDE BECAUSE MY DAD TAUGHT ME TO ALWAYS GO ON THE SCARY RIDE
MATH MAKES SENSE OF THE WORLD
EVERYONE'S FILLED SOMETHING UP WITH WATER BEFORE SO I GET KIDS ANSWERING THE QUESTION HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE
HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE YOU TO FILL IT UP
MATH IS THE VOCABULARY FOR YOUR OWN INTUITION
WE HAD A GOOD CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT
AND ASK YOURSELF WHAT PROBLEM HAVE YOU SOLVED EVER THAT WAS WORTH SOLVING WHERE YOU KNEW ALL OF THE GIVEN
I'M SURE WE ALL AGREE THAT NO PROBLEM WORTH SOLVING IS LIKE THAT
AND WE REALIZE HOW GREAT WOULD IT BE IF WE JUST HAD SOME A B C AND D LABELS TO TALK ABOUT THEM MORE EASILY
SO DECIDE FOR YOURSELF
DO YOU WANT A LOT OF SHINY OBJECTS
OUR MODERN FUNERARY PRACTICES ARE DESIGNED TO STAVE OFF THE NATURAL PROCESSES THAT HAPPEN TO A BODY AFTER DEATH
OLD CHURCHES AND INDUSTRIAL WAREHOUSES CAN BE CONVERTED INTO PLACES WHERE WE CREATE
WE WANT TO HELP INDIVIDUALS ORGANIZATIONS AND DOWN THE ROAD MUNICIPALITIES DESIGN AND BUILD
THEY LOVE THE SCREEN
BUT I WANT THEM TO PLAY AS A MOM I WANT THEM TO PLAY LIKE REAL WORLD PLAY
FOR ME I HAVE THREE YOUNG BOYS AND I WANT THEM TO HAVE A REALLY GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR GRANDPARENTS
WE TRY SKYPE WE TRY PHONE CALLS BUT MY BOYS ARE LITTLE THEY DON'T REALLY WANT TO TALK THEY WANT TO PLAY
BECAUSE THE CHALLENGE IS NOT LOSING WEIGHT IT'S ACTUALLY KEEPING IT OFF
ANTIBIOTIC TREATMENT CAN ALSO IMPACT THE MICROBIOME
YOU SEE TRADITIONALLY THE STUDY OF MICROBES HAD BEEN FOCUSED ON THE ROLE OF PATHOGENS THOSE
I THINK THAT THESE INTERACTIONS MAY HAVE A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE FOR US MAINTAINING OUR HUMAN MICROBIAL
IT CAN NOT FEED THE WORLD FOR ONE
WE'RE NOT MATCHING OUR RESOURCES TO OUR PRIORITIES
INSTEAD OF WHICH WE'VE ALLOWED OURSELVES TO BE TEMPTED TOWARDS REGIME CHANGE
BUT YOU NEED TO LOOK AT CONTEXT
THE PROBLEM IN LIBYA IS THAT WE ARE ALWAYS PUSHING FOR THE BLACK OR WHITE
WE CRITICIZED PEOPLE A LOT IN BOSNIA FOR BEING QUITE SLOW TO TAKE ON WAR CRIMINALS
THEY SIMPLY DON'T HAVE A CONVENTIONAL MILITARY OPTION
NOW IS THIS A NEW IDEA
SO THEY'RE TESTING ITS VIRULENCE
IT'S COMMONLY REPORTED IN UKRAINE THAT CHILDREN WHEN LEAVING THE ORPHANAGE ARE TARGETED FOR HUMAN
YET THESE MEN REMAIN DEAD
AND ARE MONITORING THEIR PROGRESS TO SEE IF IT WILL EFFECTIVELY KILL THEM
AND I WAS THEREFORE ABLE TO PHOTOGRAPH THE FULLY ASSEMBLED REMAINS
ANOTHER WAY TO ELICIT ONE OF YOUR HIGHEST VALUES IS TO LOOK AT WHERE YOU SPEND INVEST YOUR
WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE DO YOU LOVE SPENDING TIME WITH
ANYTHING THAT WAS A VOID WHEN YOU GREW UP YOU END UP DOING EVERYTHING TO AVOID IN YOUR ADULT LIFE
WHAT KIND OF BOOKS DO YOU MOST LIKE TO READ
NOW IS YOUR TIME
THIS IS THE END
SO RATHER THAN RANDOMLY PICKING FROM THE LOT GET CLEAR ON WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY THEN GO FIND SOMEONE THAT IS IN ALIGNMENT
LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE
IN ORDER FOR US TO GET MAXIMUM VALUE FROM OUR TIME AND OUR LIFE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND OUR
LIVING IN ACCORDANCE WITH YOUR HIGHEST VALUES MEANS LIVING BY WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY
WE'VE GOT TO COME UP WITH UNIQUE WAYS TO TRY AND SAVE ELEPHANTS
ONE WAY WE CAN DO THAT IS TO TRY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THEM
IT COSTS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR TO EDUCATE CHILDREN
ELEPHANTS ARE ON THE VERGE OF EXTINCTION ON TWO CONTINENTS
AFRICA AND ASIA
APPARENTLY SOME WOULD HAVE US BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE DEGREES OF RAPE
BLURRED LINES INDEED
EVERYONE OF THOSE PEOPLE TALKS TO A FEW PEOPLE
RAPE AND ABUSE IS ALSO USED AS A USEFUL PLOT TWIST IN SOME OF THE MOST HIGHLY RATED SHOWS ON
HE MAKES HER A COFFEE BUT SHE IS COMPLETELY WIPED OUT
SO THAT IS WHAT SHE DOES
TODAY I AM GOING TO TALK TO YOU PRECISELY ABOUT HOW OUR UNDERSTANDING OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN
SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING WE SEE ON THOSE GREETING CARDS ONCE A YEAR
SHE LOOKED AT ME AND SHE SAID AT FIRST I THINK YOU ARE BAD
WE THINK OF IT AS SOMETHING FOR THE NELSON MANDELAS AND THE MOTHER TERESAS OF THE WORLD BUT WE DON'T
AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE DON'T THINK IT'S PRACTICAL BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T MADE IT AN ACHIEVABLE
AND THESE KIDS I JUST LOVED THEM
I HADN'T SEEN HER BEFORE
I ASKED HER THE QUESTION I ASKED EVERYONE
YOU SEE IT TAKES ME TWO WEEKS MAYBE TWO MONTHS SOMETIMES TO ONBOARD AN EMPLOYEE WITH THE CITY OF
SO WE HAD THAT COMMUNITY TRUST BUT WE HAD TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF AN HONEST CONVERSATION ALSO AS A COMMUNITY
WE PAY OUR PANHANDLERS 9 AN HOUR
ARE YOU READY TO THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT THESE PERSISTENT SOCIAL ISSUES
FIRST ONE IS
ALBUQUERQUE NEW MEXICO
ABSOLUTELY IT'S MAKING A DIFFERENCE
6 OVER THE COST OF LEAVING SOMEONE TO STRUGGLE FOR SURVIVAL ON THE STREETS
WE CAN TELL THE TAXPAYERS WE CAN SAVE YOU 31
ALBUQUERQUE IS NOW ONE OF THE NATIONAL LEADERS IN COMBATING SOME OF THE MOST STUBBORN AND PERSISTENT SOCIAL ISSUES
WE HAD TO GET PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN THEY HAND 5 OUT THE WINDOW THEY MIGHT BE
WE FEED THEM ONCE AT THE JOB SITE
BUT WE ALSO HAD TO HAVE COMMUNITY TRUST
AT THE END OF THE DAY WHEN THEY GET BACK TO ST
IS THERE ANYTHING LEFT TO DO IN YOUR CITY
BUT YET HE'S STILL STANDING UNDER MY SIGN WITH A SIGN THAT SAYS HE WANTS A JOB
HE WANTS A JOB
I WENT BACK TO MY OFFICE GATHERED MY STAFF AROUND AND SAID
THEY SEE THAT THEY CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE
WE COULD BE PROVIDING SPECIAL SCHOOLS AT BOTH THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL AND THE MIDDLE SCHOOL LEVEL BUT EVEN IN
IT MEANS THAT IT'S IN THE LOW 60 PERCENT
THERE'S STILL TIME TO NUDGE THEM IF WE THINK ABOUT NUDGING THEM RATHER THAN JUST PUNISHING THEM
AND WE COULD BE NUDGING KIDS LIKE WILL OFF OF THE PATH THAT WE'RE ON
THAT'S THE CORNER I WANT TO EXPLORE
THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE WERE WAY MORE GUYS ON DEATH ROW THAN THERE WERE LAWYERS WHO HAD BOTH THE INTEREST AND THE
DO YOU KNOW WHAT ALL TIME LOW IN TEXAS MEANS
THESE THREE INNOVATIONS SET IN MOTION THE MOST PROFOUND CHANGES IN HUMAN
AT THE TIME I WAS WORKING AS THE SCIENCE ADVISOR TO THE US SECRETARY OF STATE THEN CONDOLEEZZA RICE
LET'S LOOK AT SOME TRENDS
THE FEMININE BEAUTY
AS A CURVY WOMAN IT WAS THE ASSUMPTION THAT I SHOULD LOOK UP TO MARILYN MONROE OR JENNIFER LOPEZ
IN MY LOWEST MOMENTS OF INSECURITY THIS IS WHEN I REALIZED THAT I HAD TO RECLAIM MY
I WAS 12 YEARS OLD AND SCOUTED IN A MALL
I WOULD SEE THAT PERSON'S EYEBROW RAISE AS I WOULD REPLY
WELL I'M A PLUS SIZE MODEL
WE DON'T KNOW HOW FAR WE CAN GO WITH ROBOTICS TECHNOLOGY YET
THIS ALSO GIVES THEM AN APPRECIATION OF WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH THIS TECHNOLOGY
SO THE BENEFITS OF ROBOTS IN THE CLASSROOM ARE NOT JUST ABOUT KIDS ENGAGING WITH THE TECHNOLOGY
I HAD SOME GREAT TEACHERS WHO REALLY INSPIRED ME
I WAS TOLD THIS WAS A GREAT JOB AS IT WAS SECURE
OUR KIDS WILL SHOW US THAT
BECAUSE IT'S EASY TO SEE IF A ROBOT MOVES THE WAY IT SHOULD THEY GET IMMEDIATE FEEDBACK ON WHETHER THEIR CODING
THE HANDS ON APPLICATION OF THESE STEM CONCEPTS LETS THEM APPLY THEIR LEARNING AND BUILD THEIR UNDERSTANDING
I WAS THAT KID WHO NOT ONLY SAW A FUTURE WITH ROBOTS BUT A FUTURE WHERE I WAS A TEACHER
SO NEXT TIME YOU ARE TALKING TO A YOUNG PERSON DON'T ASK THEM WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE WHEN YOU GROW UP
THEY ARE USING THEIR ROBOTS TO THINK WITH AND TO WORK TOGETHER TO PROBLEM SOLVE IN TEAMS AS THEY MAKE
AND ROBOTS BELONG IN EVERY CLASSROOM BECAUSE THE HANDS ON ACTIVITIES CAN TRANSFORM LEARNING
BY INTERACTING WITH ROBOTS BY BUILDING ROBOTS BY MOVING AND PROGRAMMING ROBOTS KIDS ARE
IT'S LIKELY THAT ROBOTS AND AUTOMATION WILL REPLACE A LOT OF THEIR JOBS IN THE FUTURE
IT WAS THESE HANDS ON ACTIVITIES THAT I REMEMBER MOST AS A KID
IT'S WHAT I WANTED
I WENT TO A SCHOOL WHERE IT WAS UNUSUAL TO GO TO UNIVERSITY ESPECIALLY FOR A GIRL
AND YOU OUGHT TO REINVEST AND REINVEST
CERTAINLY WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING IS TRYING TO SAY
TEACHERS WHO WORK TOGETHER COLLECTIVELY COLLABORATIVELY TO UNDERSTAND THEIR IMPACT
SO THE QUESTION IS CAN WE BRIDGE THIS GULF
IT'S THE FIRST TIME WE'D DONE THIS
GO FIGURE IT OUT
WE COULD WALK THERE
AND I ASKED THEM TO PUT THEIR OWN VOICE OVER IT
THE INFORMATION WAS INSIDE MY HOUSE AND IT WAS AWESOME
THEY WILL NOT DISAPPOINT
AND SO WE CHOSE TO LOOK AT PAUL RUSESABAGINA AS AN EXAMPLE OF A GENTLEMAN WHO
THEY CALLED OFFICES
THEY CHECKED SCHEDULES
THEY WERE MEETING WITH SECRETARIES
ME AND YOU WE ARE GOING TO RELEARN WHAT BEAUTY REALLY IS BECAUSE WHO TAUGHT YOU THAT THE VALUE OF A
DON'T YOU SEE
WHEN THEY TEACH YOU ABOUT HONAM IN THE BLUE EYED CLASSROOMS OF YOUR SCHOOLS DO THEY EVER ACTUALLY TELL YOU
SOMETHING IN YOU BREAKS THOUGH DOESN'T IT
YOUR MATH IS DANGEROUSLY WRONG
WHEN WILL WE BELIEVE
AND THIS WAR WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING
LOOK AT HOW YOUR HONAM SHINES BROWN GIRL
I SEE LUPITA EVERYWHERE I GO STARING AT THE EIFFEL TOWER IN PARIS SITTING AT A SMALL
EVEN THE STARS STOLEN IN THEIR INFINITE GRACE ONLY SHOW UP AT THE DARKEST POINT OF NIGHT SHOWING
ARE THERE WORDS IN YOUR TEXTBOOK LIKE LIKE HONAM
LIKE LIKE AMNIOTIC LOVE
LIKE UBANI NENTU WATCH HER WALK WITH GRACE
SO THIS IS A VERY COMMON DISEASE
I BEGAN THIS TALK WITH MODELS
CHRIS ANDERSON I REALLY LIKE THIS METAPHOR
WHAT ELSE WE HAVE IS DATA
EVERYTHING WENT ON WELL
NOW WORLD IMAGINE
WHY NOT IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA
WHY NOT IN ERYTREA
WHERE AM I GOING TO GET DOCTORS FROM TO WORK IN SOMALILAND
WHY NOT IN ETHIOPIA
WHY NOT IN NEIGHBOURING SOMALIA
IF IT CAN BE DONE IN SOMALILAND IT CAN BE DONE ANYWHERE
OUR WOMEN DIE OF CAUSES THAT NO WOMAN IN THIS DAY AND AGE WHERE MAN HAS REACHED THE MOON NO WOMAN
GO AND GET YOUR HEART ATTACK TREATED SOMEWHERE ELSE
WE CAN DEAL WITH A HEMORRHAGE AS SOON AS A WOMAN COMES IN WE HAVE AN OPERATING THEATER THAT WORKS 24 HOURS A
BUT THEY TAKE 8 OR 9 YEARS TO TRAIN AND FOR GOODNESS SAKES
THAT WOULD DEMONSTRATE WHAT WE PREACH AND WHAT WE SPEAK ABOUT AS PEOPLE OF FAITH
NOW BOTH ISLAM AND CHRISTIANITY UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE OF SOCIAL IMPACT AS CRITICAL
BY CLAIMING THAT WE HAVE NO POWER OVER OUR PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE WE GIVE TOO MUCH
I STUMBLED AND MUMBLED AS I RESPONDED
THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY YOUNG AFRICAN CHILDREN DIE
AFRICA HAS HAD A MIXED AFFAIR WITH ORGANIZED RELIGION WITH BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE
IF YOU'RE NOT AWARE IT IS THE BRAINCHILD OF BAS LANSDORP
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OTHER OPTIONS
EVERY 26 SECONDS SOMEONE DROPS OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL
AND JESSE SOTO HAS GRIT AND THE ABILITY BY USING HIS VOICE TO CHANGE HOW
AND THE BOMBSIGHT WILL TELL HIM WHEN TO DROP THE BOMB
SECONDLY IT BREAKS DOWN A LOT
AND THIS IS THE PROBLEM WITH OUR INFATUATION WITH THE THINGS WE MAKE
I TALKED ABOUT SPAGHETTI SAUCE
THE MISSION OF THE TWO SQUADRONS WAS TO GET RID OF ALL THE SCUD MISSILE LAUNCHERS
WE THINK WE'RE NOW AT 95 PERCENT ACCURACY WHEN IT COMES TO DRONE STRIKES
IT'S A COMPLICATED PHYSICS PROBLEM
WELL IT'S EXTRAORDINARY
BUT HE SAID WITH THE MARK 15 NORDEN BOMBSIGHT HE COULD DROP A BOMB INTO A PICKLE BARREL AT
SO THEY STARTED FLYING THEM AT HIGH ALTITUDES AT INCREDIBLY HIGH SPEEDS
WELL IT ALLOWED YOU TO DO THAT
AND WHAT DID THE NORDEN BOMBSIGHT DO
THEY'VE INVENTED WEBSITES THAT WILL ALLOW PEOPLE TO BE FREE
AND AFTER THE WAR WAS OVER THERE WAS AN AUDIT DONE AS THE ARMY ALWAYS DOES THE AIR FORCE ALWAYS DOES AND THEY ASKED THE QUESTION HOW
NOW WHAT IS THE ACCURACY OF THOSE DRONES
WELL HOW MANY CLOUDLESS SKIES DO YOU THINK THERE WERE ABOVE CENTRAL EUROPE BETWEEN 1940 AND
THIRDLY WHEN NORDEN WAS MAKING HIS CALCULATIONS HE ASSUMED THAT A PLANE WOULD BE FLYING AT A RELATIVELY
IT WAS LIKE MANNA FROM HEAVEN
AND WHAT WAS GOD'S WILL
THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN THE HARDER PROBLEM WHEN IT COMES TO FIGHTING WARS
THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY RECORDS IN THE HISTORY OF MODERN WARFARE
IT WEIGHS ABOUT 50 LBS
AND THE MAN'S NAME IS CARL NORDEN
IT'S A REAL PLEASURE TO BE HERE
AND I MEAN THAT IN ITS FULLEST SENSE OF THE WORD
AND THAT IS ON AUGUST 6 1945 A B 29 BOMBER
IS IT BECAUSE THEIR WEAPONS WEREN'T ACCURATE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
NOT VERY WELL IT TURNS OUT
THERE ARE SEVEN QUESTIONS
THEY CAN SURPRISE US ALL
I'M CREATING AN EVENT SERIES CALLED ART AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND THE MAIN AIM OF THIS IS TO SHOWCASE SOME OF THE EXCELLENT TALENT WE HAVE IN
BY DOING SO WE HOPE TO ELEVATE THEIR CAREER PROSPECTS BUT ALSO HELP THEM DEVELOP THEIR OWN BUSINESS IDEAS AS WELL
BUT MY BIGGEST THANK YOU HAS TO GO TO THE ARTISTS
I'M GETTING THERE
BUT FOR SOME REASON I'VE SEEN THE DISAPPEARANCE OF YOUTH CLUBS AND THE EVAPORATION OF THE CLEAR SERVICE CONNECTIONS
THESE AFOREMENTIONED FACTORS ARE CREATING A MELTING POT THAT IS BUBBLING OVER
I HOPE YOU ENJOY
BOTH MODELS IMPROVE
THAT'S REALLY HARD
THEY CAN HAVE A PRECISE IDEA OF WHERE THEY ARE AND SORT OF A VAGUE IDEA OF WHERE THE OTHER CARS ARE
I STEP ON THE BRAKE
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WHEN YOU GET TOO MUCH CHATTER IT'S HARD TO PROCESS ALL THE PACKETS SO YOU HAVE TO PRIORITIZE
WITH CARS IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE
THIS GUY IS STOPPING DEAD STOP DEAD STOP ON THE HIGHWAY
WHY DO WE DO THIS
I BELIEVE THAT
A CONVERSATION IS AN ADVENTURE
WHAT DID YOU THINK OF IT
AND I LOOK AT HER AND I SAY WOW
THE GROCERY GUY THE CAB GUY MAYBE THE RECEPTIONIST AT A NEW OFFICE YOU WENT TO
I THINK I'VE HEARD THAT SOMEWHERE
OR MAYBE THEY ARE BUT I JUST COULDN'T SEE IT BACK THEN
PHARMACEUTICAL TECHNOLOGY DOES NOT
BUT HERE'S THE BEST NEWS OF ALL
AND THAT'S A QUESTION ON WHICH WE CAN MAKE HEADWAY
THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION THAT ORGANIZATIONS CAN GATHER ABOUT YOU AND HOW THEY CAN USE IT TO INFLUENCE YOU IN A WAY THAT YOU WILL NOT
AND IN PRINCIPLE THAT'S A VERY GOOD THING
SO PEOPLE SEEM TO THINK THAT TECHNOLOGY IS NOTHING MORE THAN THIS CANDY STORE THEY CAN GO INTO AND IF THEY
IT MEANS ROOM
I THINK IT WAS UP ON THAT SLIDE
AND YOU PUT THIS ON TOP OF ANOTHER PIECE OF PAPER THAT'S COATED WITH SILVER NITRATE AND YOU EXPOSE THE BACK TO SOME
AND THAT WAS WHEN I HAD THE IDEA
AND VERY QUICKLY SOME LETTERS STARTED COMING BACK
I THINK THERE'S A NUMBER OF PILLARS TO SUCCESS
AND IT WAS 800 AM WHEN I STOOD THERE
I WAS LIVING AT MY MOM'S PLACE
THIS MUST BE CREATED
WHY DON'T WE BRING TRUCE TO LIFE
THAT WAS AN INCREDIBLE MOMENT
WHY DON'T WE ALL TEAM UP
THERE WAS NO STARTING POINT FOR PEACE
ONE OF THE FIRST LETTERS WAS FROM THE DALAI LAMA
SO HE WAS LIKE MY HERO
WE HAD TO WAIT NOW AND SEE WHAT HAPPENED
I THINK THE CAMERA IS
KOFI ANNAN SAID THIS WILL BE BENEFICIAL TO MY TROOPS ON THE GROUND
I WAS WITH BRAHIMI AMBASSADOR BRAHIMI
ULTIMATELY THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE INDIVIDUALS
AND I WENT BACK TO THE U
I SAID WHAT WOULD YOU DO
AND I WAS WAITING FOR HIM TO COME DOWN AND I KNEW THAT HE WAS ON HIS WAY
AND I REMEMBER THE FIRST LETTER
HE SAW THE BOMB GO OFF AT NAGASAKI
AND THEN WE WENT HOME
WHY DON'T YOU SUPPORT THE PROCESS OF THE LARGEST EVER GLOBAL TRUCE
IT'S ALL ABOUT PARTNERSHIPS
MAYBE THERE'S A LITTLE CHANGE I CAN GET INVOLVED IN
AND THAT ACTUALLY AT THAT MOMENT SOMETHING HAPPENED TO ME WHICH OBVIOUSLY MADE ME GO I'M GOING TO DOCUMENT
IT'S ABOUT YOUR CONSTITUENCIES IT'S ABOUT YOUR BUSINESSES
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET INVOLVED IN THAT PROCESS
I DECIDED THAT I'D CONTINUE FILMING AND MAKE ANOTHER MOVIE
IS THIS POSSIBLE
AND SO THE BIG QUESTION THAT I ASKED MYSELF BACK IN DECEMBER OF 2012 IS
WELL HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND ME WHO WANT TO BE MENTORS GET REALLY GREAT MATCHES
AND WHEN I THINK BACK ON ALL OF THE SKILLS AND THE KNOWLEDGE THAT I'VE GAINED FROM MENTORS THE GREATEST GIFT I
AND SO YESTERDAY IT WAS VERY INTERESTING TO MEET WITH THESE PEOPLE
THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHO I WAS
IT'S ALREADY WITH US
WE HAVE A PLAN WE THINK WE HAVE A PLAN
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT
LIFE SUDDENLY BECAME COMPLEX
SO UNFORTUNATELY I CAN'T REVEAL EXACTLY THE PLANS THAT I HAVE NEXT
IT'S A VERY EFFICIENT LIGHT
AND IN FACT THEY DID
THE EFFECT ON THE EYE
SO IT'S NOT JUST INCIDENTAL OF A YELLOW PIGMENT
YOU CAN IMAGINE PACKING RED BLUE AND GREEN CHROMATOPHORES TOGETHER AND EXPANDING AND CONTRACTING THOSE TO PRODUCE ANY
IN FACT THOSE THAT ARE USED FOR COURTSHIP THOSE IN AREAS OF THE PLUMAGE USED TO ATTRACT A FEMALE THEY'VE
IT MOVED VERY QUICKLY AND IT HAD HARD PARTS TO TEAR ANIMALS APART
IT EXISTS ONLY IN THE MINDS OF ANIMALS WITH EYES
SO THEY'D EVOLVED TO BE VERY VERY EFFICIENT
AND WE STILL DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND HOW OUR IMAGES OF THE WORLD ARE PUT TOGETHER
I KNOW OF A GAY COUPLE THAT WENT ON THEIR HONEY MOON
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES WE'VE BEEN IN THAT SAME SITUATION WHERE WE JUST DON'T TAKE
YOU CANNOT APPROACH THIS PODIUM TOGETHER
AND IT'S EVEN MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT
YOU MUST FILL OUT SEPARATE FORMS
BUT WE NUMB OURSELVES TO IT
AND THE OTHER THING I THOUGHT WAS I'M SO RELIEVED SHE WOULDN'T TAKE MY HAND
I HAD A NETWORK OF SUPPORT
IT WAS A GREAT NIGHT
I'VE HAD ENOUGH
WE'RE GOING TO BE REASONABLE PEOPLE
LIFE PARTNER SOUNDS VERY FORMAL
AND WHEN HATE CRIMES ARE INFLICTED THEY'RE USUALLY THE MOST VIOLENT CATEGORY
YOU QUIT YOUR JOB ARE YOU CRAZY
WHO QUITS THEIR JOB IN THIS ECONOMY
EVEN THOUGH I ASSURED MY DAD THAT IT WAS JUST A LEAVE OF ABSENCE HE WAS UNABLE TO COMPREHEND WHAT WAS FOR HIM THE SHEER
WHAT'S SO AMAZING ABOUT THE MARINA BARRAGE IS THAT IT HAS BEEN BUILT TO MAKE THE MAXIMUM USE OF ITS LARGE
AND ONE WAY TO DO THAT IS TO SPEND LESS TIME IN THE SHOWER
AND IT WORKED
HUNDREDS OF ORGANIZATIONS DOWNLOADED THE TOOLKIT
AND TO BE HONEST SOMETIMES I QUITE ENJOYED THEIR ATTENTION AS WELL
NOW AT FIRST I WOULD HAVE BELIEVED THEM
YOU SEE THAT GLASS OF WATER
FOURTEEN MINUTES IS NOT ENOUGH TIME TO FULLY CREDIT THOSE GOOD AND GENEROUS PEOPLE WHO FOUGHT WITH ME AND
AND MENACING SO IN THIS RESPECT A VITAL FIRST STEP WAS LEARNING TO SEPARATE OUT A METAPHORICAL MEANING FROM
AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST IT'S ALSO MORE CONVENIENT TO BUY FOOD IN A GROUP
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ALL WANT TO HAPPEN
AND SO WHAT I THOUGHT IS JUST TO SHARE WITH YOU HOW I'M DOING MY GROCERIES EVERYDAY
SO WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU TONIGHT IS SOME TIPS AND TRICKS
EVERYONE DOES NOT HAVE A CHALKED OUT PATH
BUT WHEN I WAS A LITTLE KID I USED TO HAVE REALLY SHORT HAIR
BUT JUST BECAUSE SIX OF THEM SAID NO TO YOU IN A ROW DOESN'T MEAN YOU'LL GIVE UP ON GOING HOME RIGHT
WHEN I STARTED WITH THE INTERNET WHICH WAS ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO WE'D ALL BEEN USED
THAT CUP SONG THAT HAPPENED ON A WHIM TOO
EVENTUALLY I REALIZED THAT IT WAS OK TO NOT DO WHAT SHE WAS DOING AND SHE WAS STILL GOING TO BE PROUD OF
ALBERT EINSTEIN ONCE SAID
I NEED SOMEBODY TO HOLD THE CAMERA
THINGS DON'T ALWAYS WORK ACCORDING TO PLAN
AND LET ME TELL YOU NOT A LOT OF THOSE AUDITIONS ACTUALLY TRANSLATED INTO OFFERS BUT IT TURNED
BUT I REALIZED THAT I SHOULDN'T GIVE UP AND I KEPT AT IT AND I'M GLAD THAT I DID
WE ALWAYS FEEL THAT WHATEVER WE DO OR WHATEVER RISKS WE TAKE OR WHATEVER SIDE WAY WE TAKE FROM THE KPI
IT'S LIKE WATER
THAT'S WHERE THEY RECRUIT FROM
WE'RE ALL VICTIMS OF TERRORISM
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO THERE IS TURN PIRATES TO FISHERMAN
THAT'S WHERE THEIR CONSUMERS COME FROM
THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE MISTAKES
THERE'S A WAR ON PIRACY
WE'VE GOT TO COMPETE
A GOOD ONE IS IN SOMALIA
THAT'S WHERE THEY GET THEIR POWER AND STRENGTH
BUT MISTAKES OF THE PAST ARE INEVITABLE
SO HOW ARE YOU GOING TO RESPOND TO IT
SO WE'VE GOT TO FIND A DIFFERENT MECHANISM AND ONE OF THE BEST MECHANISMS I'VE EVER COME ACROSS IS THE VICTIMS OF
IT'S HUMAN NATURE
THEY'RE NOT JUST GOING TO BE SMART
THERE'S OTHER EXAMPLES
MAYBE THE ROLLING STONES HAS A PLACE IN THIS
WE MUST FOSTER INNOVATION AS I'VE SAID
SHE'S GOING TO GIVE UP UNIVERSITY
AND WE HAVE TO GET OUR MESSAGING IN THERE
WE'VE GOT TO SHOW OUR VALUES
WHY WAS IT EFFECTIVE
IF ANYONE THINKS YOU CAN HAVE A WAR ON PIRACY LIKE A WAR ON TERRORISM AND BEAT IT YOU'RE WRONG
WE'VE GOT TO ATTACK THAT BRAND IN FRONT OF THEM
THERE'S TWO ESSENTIAL WAYS OF DOING THAT IF WE CARRY ON THIS BRAND THEME
IT'S NOT JUST OUR FLESH AND BLOOD THEY WANT
THEY'VE WORKED HARD ON THEIR POSE TO MAKE THEIR COSTUME LOOK GREAT FOR YOUR CAMERA
I MADE A LOT OF MY OWN TOYS
AND WE'RE MAKING IT OUR OWN
I'LL DRESS AS NEO FROM THE MATRIX
I WAS WAY TOO YOUNG TO SEE IT BUT I WAS CAUGHT UP IN JAWS FEVER LIKE EVERYONE ELSE IN AMERICA AT THE TIME
I'M THINKING ARE YOU KIDDING
I'M WEARING A SUIT OF ARMOR
AND OUR BOYS WELL THEY WEAR THEIR UNIFORM WITH GREAT PRIDE
THAT A FAMILY IS THERE FOR YOU
MY FATHER NEVER HAD THE CHANCE TO FINISH HIS SCHOOLING AND YET HE REMAINS AS ONE OF THE GREATEST TEACHERS THAT I'VE EVER
AND YEP YOU GUESSED IT
WHERE REGARDLESS OF WHERE A SCHOOL SITS ON SOME SIMPLISTIC RANKING SYSTEM
EIGHT YEARS ON AND OUR SCHOOL IS ALMOST UNRECOGNIZABLE
THE POSITIVITY IS INFECTIOUS AND SUPERSTARS WELL THEY'RE MADE UP OF ORDINARY PEOPLE
THEY WANT TO BE AT THIS SCHOOL
WE TRIED TO CATCH THEM DOING THE RIGHT THING AND ACKNOWLEDGE THEM FOR THAT
ONCE THRIVING IT HAD LOST ITS WAY
YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME
AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT
HE HAD MY BACK
WE WERE THERE FOR THEM WHEN THEY FELL
A SCHOOL WHERE TOO MANY PEOPLE HAD GIVEN UP ON
I HEARD ALL SORTS OF STORIES BEFORE I STARTED THERE
LAST YEAR 65 OF OUR BOYS WENT ON TO FURTHER EDUCATION
THE VIOLENCE AND THE APATHY TOWARDS EDUCATION TOO
COMPARE THAT TO JUST 30 EIGHT YEARS AGO
WHERE MEMBERS OF STAFF SUFFERED POST TRAUMATIC STRESS AS A RESULT OF A CONSTANT VIOLENCE AND DYSFUNCTION
SO DID ALL THIS TINKERING AND REVIEWING AND ENGAGING AND ALL THAT SORT OF STUFF ACTUALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE ACADEMICALLY
THE ASTEROIDS ARE RICH IN MATERIALS THAT WE WANT
A DOCTOR SITS BESIDE HIM WHOSE QUICK STEADY HAND MAY MEND A BONE OR STEM THE LIFE BLOOD'S FLOW
NOT LIKE THE COACHES TODAY FOR GRACIOUS SAKES NO
I BELIEVED IN THAT
IT'S YOU AND I WHO MAKE OUR FATES WE OPEN UP OR CLOSE THE GATES ON THE ROAD AHEAD OR THE ROAD
HAVE I RAMBLED ENOUGH
IF YOU MAKE THE EFFORT TO DO THE BEST OF WHICH YOU'RE CAPABLE TRYING TO IMPROVE THE SITUATION THAT EXISTS FOR YOU I THINK THAT'S
AND I WANTED THEM TO BE ABLE TO SHOOT FROM THE OUTSIDE
I'D LEARNED THESE PRIOR TO COMING TO UCLA AND I DECIDED THEY WERE VERY IMPORTANT
BUT WHEN WE FAIL TO GIVE OUR BEST WE SIMPLY HAVEN'T MET THE TEST OF GIVING ALL AND SAVING NONE UNTIL THE GAME IS REALLY
I'M PAID TO DO IT
IT'S BEARING DOWN THAT WINS THE CUP
I USED TO SAY THAT WHEN A GAME IS OVER AND YOU SEE SOMEBODY THAT DIDN'T KNOW THE OUTCOME I HOPE THEY COULDN'T
BUT I'D WANT ONE THAT COULD PLAY TOO
YOU AND I KNOW DEEPER DOWN THERE'S ALWAYS A CHANCE TO WIN THE CROWN
I BELIEVE IN TIME VERY IMPORTANT
I DIDN'T WANT THAT
WHAT WOULD YOU WANT
AND THAT'S NOT RIGHT
WEBSTER DEFINED IT AS THE ACCUMULATION OF MATERIAL POSSESSIONS OR THE ATTAINMENT OF A POSITION OF POWER OR PRESTIGE OR SOMETHING
SO I WANTED TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING OF MY OWN
I BELIEVE THAT'S TRUE
I CAN NEVER ANSWER THAT
THAT WE ALL KNOW OF
AND ALSO THERE IS NO BOUNDARY BETWEEN CLASSROOMS
FORTUNATELY RESEARCHERS ARE PROVING THAT MASTERING ANY FIELD DEPENDS MUCH MORE ON
THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL WAY TO MAKE AN IMAGE IS TO DRAW ONE
DRAWING HABITUATES THAT THOUGHT PROCESS AND BEARING IT IN MIND IS A PERFECTLY NATURAL WAY OF
40 OF OUR BRAIN IS DEVOTED TO PROCESSING VISUAL INFORMATION THAT'S MORE THAN ALL OVER
NOW SPECIFICALLY I'M TALKING ABOUT OBSERVATIONAL DRAWING WHICH MEANS TO OBSERVE SOMETHING AND DRAW AN
THIS IDEA CREATE A DANGEROUS MENTAL BLOCK TO HUMAN CAPACITY
LIGHT LINES CAN BE DRAWN EVALUATED AND REDRAWN AS MANY TIMES AS NECESSARY IN
TOO OFTEN PEOPLE EXPERIENCE A SENSE OF SHAME REGARDING THEIR MISTAKES BUT IMAGINE WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT IN YOUR LIFE HAD
IN FACT NEW IDEAS ONLY OCCUR WHEN WE TAKE RISKS AND OUR FAILURES BECOME PRODUCTIVE
WE NEED A SWAB OF DNA AND A WILLINGNESS TO SAY WHAT'S INSIDE ME
I WOULD BE WILLING TO PARTICIPATE
AND INSTEAD OF BEING 20000 OR 30000 LAST MONTH WE PASSED ONE HALF MILLION
AM I GOING TO OWN IT
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR
I WANT TO GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES
NOTICE THEY WERE CARRYING MUTATIONS FROM BIRTH THAT WERE PROTECTIVE THAT WERE PROTECTING THEM FROM GOING ON TO
WOULD YOU GET ANY POPULATION LEVEL IMMUNITY
BUT IF YOU TOOK THIS 30 PERCENT THESE 300 PEOPLE AND HAD THEM NOMINATE THEIR FRIENDS AND TOOK THE SAME NUMBER OF
SO ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS WE THOUGHT WE WOULD TACKLE WOULD BE HOW WE GO ABOUT PREDICTING EPIDEMICS
WE TOOK 1300 RANDOMLY SELECTED UNDERGRADUATES WE HAD THEM NOMINATE THEIR FRIENDS AND WE FOLLOWED BOTH THE RANDOM
SO IF WE HAVE A POPULATION OF A THOUSAND PEOPLE AND WE WANT TO MAKE THE POPULATION IMMUNE TO A PATHOGEN WE DON'T HAVE TO
THAT IS THE WAY IT WAS AND IS AND WILL BE
THERE WAS I DON'T KNOW
SAID BIG MYSTERY'S MOTHER
NOW WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO
THERE IS A MOTHER BACK BEHIND EVERYTHING
THE OVERNIGHT' FELL DOWN AND
EVENTUALLY SEX' AND THINKING' GOT MARRIED
IT STILL DOES
AND INDEED IT WAS CHEWING GUM
IF AUSTRALIA HAD TO SEND 1000 PEOPLE TOMORROW TO WEST PAPUA FOR EXAMPLE WE DON'T HAVE
THEY'D RELEASED A BUNCH OF PEOPLE BUT THEY STILL HAD ABOUT 700 PEOPLE HOSTAGE
THEY'RE TRAINED TO THINK MORE TO TRY AND DE ESCALATE
SO YOU FEEL THIS MASSIVE HEAT AND YOU GO I WANT TO GET OUT OF THE WAY
SAME POLICE DISTRICT
THE POLICE MINISTER'S AND A HEAP OF PUBLIC STATEMENTS WERE MADE ABOUT IT
THAT YOU USE NONLETHAL WEAPONS FIRST SO YOUR LETHAL WEAPONS WILL ACTUALLY BE MORE EFFECTIVE
THEY WERE HOLDING SOMETHING LIKE 700 PEOPLE HOSTAGE
ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF MILITARY USE OF FORCE IS THAT YOU HAVE TO BE DISCRIMINATE YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT WHO YOU'RE
THE PEOPLE YOU'LL BE SHOOTING AT WON'T BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF THE WAY
I LOOKED AT IT
THEY'RE TRAINED TO BE MORE RESTRAINED IN THE USE OF FORCE THAN THE MILITARY ARE
THE WAY THEY DID IT WAS TO PUMP THE WHOLE THING FULL OF ANESTHETIC GAS
ONE OF THOSE PROBLEMS IS
SHE TOOK UP A MORE THREATENING POSITION IN HER BED
ANOTHER CHILD WITHIN WEEKS OF TASERING THE SIX YEAR OLD BOY
SO I STARTED TO INVESTIGATE SOME OF THOSE ISSUES AND HAVE A LOOK AT THE WAY POLICE USE
SO THEY ARE ABLE TO DO IT IN THAT SENSE
IF THE PERSON DOESN'T FOLLOW DIRECTIONS THEY MAY END UP SHOOTING THEM AND THEN FIND OUT AFTERWARDS EITHER
SO AGAIN THEY'D SAY WITH ACCESS TO NONLETHAL WEAPONS IF WE'VE GOT SOMEONE WE KNOW IS HOSTILE WE CAN DO SOMETHING TO DEAL WITH THEM
I WAS REALLY SURPRISED
WHOEVER HAS A STRONG WHY' WILL BE ABLE TO ENDURE ALMOST ANY HOW
ANYONE WHO HAS BEEN TO ONE OF MY COURSES WILL TELL YOU THAT I LOVE TELLING PEOPLE ABOUT TED AND I USE IT IN MY
THE FACT THAT YOU MY CUSTOMER MY EMPLOYEE MY SPOUSE MY FRIEND THE FACT THAT YOU DON T HAVE REASONS TO
THESE TREES WILL NEVER GROW ANY FURTHER AND THEY WILL ALMOST GIVE NO FRUIT
IT DOESN T HAVE TO BE THAT WAY
DIFFERENT PEOPLE OF COURSE FIND DIFFERENT MEANINGS
SUDDENLY HE REMEMBERS THAT HE HAS SOMEONE TO HIS RIGHT
THERE S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT LOYALTY THESE DAYS
ACTUALLY 18 OF THEM LEAVE BECAUSE OF PRICE
AND IN FACT IT HAS CREATED US HAS CREATED LIFE HAS CREATED ALL THE STUFF OF LIFE
AND WE MUST HAVE THE COURAGE TO MAKE THOSE CHOICES OVER AND OVER AGAIN THROUGHOUT OUR
OR SO IT SEEMED
AND I FOUND PEOPLE TO INTERVIEW THAT WOULD LEGITIMIZE MY CHOICE FOR ME AND TALK MORE ABOUT THE
I CHANGED MY CHILDREN CHANGED
YOU SAY THE BOOK IS INTERESTING AND I SAY NO THE BOOK IS BORING
OH MY GOD LIKE MY MOM SHE'S SO ANNOYING
SO I WAS IN THE PARTY AND SUDDENLY I HAD A BRILLIANT IDEA
AM I BORING
AND BY THE WAY SAY YES ONLY IF YOU REALLY ENJOY TO DO THAT
AND I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY MY FRIENDS WERE QUITE RELUCTANT TO PLAY THIS GAME
WHAT WAS THE EXPERIENCE I WAS TRYING TO DESCRIBE
I LOVE PEOPLE
SO IF I WOULD DESCRIBE IT NOW I MIGHT SAY SOMETHING LIKE YOU KNOW MY FRIEND WHEN YOU'RE LAUGHING NOW I'M FEELING A BIT UNSURE BECAUSE I REALLY WOULD
SO WHEN THE BRITISH MUSEUM AND TEHRAN NATIONAL MUSUEM COOPERATE AND WORK TOGETHER AS WE'VE BEEN DOING
AND THEY'LL BE ABLE TO RESTORE THEIR ALTARS AND TO WORSHIP THEIR GODS IN THEIR OWN
AND THE CYRUS CYLINDER COMES BACK INTO PUBLIC VIEW AND THE TEXT OF THIS AS A
IS IRAN STILL TO BE THE DEFENDER OF THE OPPRESSED
THE RIGHT OF PEOPLES TO LIVE TOGETHER IN THE SAME STATE WORSHIPING DIFFERENTLY FREELY A
GO UP AALEH
IT'S STORY WE ALL KNOW
CYRUS KING OF THE PERSIANS HAS ENTERED BABYLON WITHOUT A FIGHT THE GREAT EMPIRE OF BABYLON
SO THE HYPERBOLE IS NOT ACTUALLY SURPRISING
I WAS WALKING IN THE MALL ONE NOVEMBER DAY AND I SAW THIS POSTER FOR A SPECIAL PHOTO SESSION WITH SANTA
I MEAN THAT SEEMS LIKE A NICE THING TO DO RIGHT
WE DESIGN SPECIAL SERVICES FOR SPECIAL KIDS
I KNOW THESE EVENTS ARE HAPPENING IN MALLS ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY AND I BET MOST PEOPLE FEEL PRETTY GOOD ABOUT THEM
AS SOMETHING FRAGILE BROKEN AND SPECIAL OR AS PEOPLE WHO HAVE
YOU MIGHT SEE YOUR OWN PERSPECTIVE REFLECTED IN ONE OF THESE MODELS OR YOU MIGHT BE THINKING THAT YOU'VE NEVER EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT
I HAD BEEN SO CAUGHT UP IN THE VISUALS AND MY OWN GOOD FEELINGS ABOUT THIS THAT I HAD COMPLETELY
IN FACT IT INFORMED THE WHOLE REST OF MY CAREER
WE FEEL SORRY FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE BROKEN AND NEED FIXING AND WE FEEL CHARITABLE WHEN WE
FOR EXAMPLE IN OUR DOCUMENTARY WE TALK ABOUT SCIENCE AND DEVELOPMENT BUT WE USE
I ALREADY WEAR GLASSES
THEY WERE ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT AFRICA CAN BRING TO THE WORLD
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
MY ANSWER IS ALWAYS THE SAME
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT CHANGE HAS TO BE ABOUT
THEY NO LONGER SEND US INTO A PANICKED DOWNWARD SPIRAL
RESEARCH TELLS US THAT LASTING CHANGE DOESN'T COME FROM DRASTIC LIFE
SHE WENT FROM ANTICIPATING ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING LIFE CHANGING EVENTS
WE HAVE BIG STRESSORS
WHEN WE COMPARE THE BRAIN SCANS OF VIETNAM VETS WITH THE BRAIN SCANS OF CHRONICALLY
WE LIVE IN SURVIVAL MODE
IT'S THAT STORY THAT I'D LIKE TO EXPLORE WITH YOU TODAY
FOR MANY YEARS I WAS A BELIEVER IN THE PLACENTAL ORIGINS AND SUFFERED FROM SOMETHING CALLED CONFIRMATION BIAS
NOW A BIAS IS A WAY IN WHICH WE SYSTEMATICALLY GET THINGS WRONG WAYS IN WHICH WE
AND YOU NEEDN'T WORRY HOW LONG THE BOOK IS OR WHETHER IT'S A COMIC STRIP OR AN EPIC
AND EVERY TIME YOU GET THE SAME RESULT
I USED TO WATCH A CHILDREN'S NEWS PROGRAMME AT THE TIME AND THIS WAS THE ERA OF SPACE EXPLORATION
AND THE BIAS I AM TALKING ABOUT WORKS LIKE THIS
AND SO IT SHOULD BE WITH US
SO THOSE ARE THE FOUR BASIC KINDS OF IMMORTALITY STORIES AND I'VE TRIED TO GIVE JUST SOME SENSE OF HOW THEY'RE
TWICE AS LIKELY
AND THE IDEA IS SIMPLE IT'S JUST THIS
THERE WERE ALWAYS ROCKETS GOING UP INTO THE SKY UP INTO SPACE GOING UP THERE
IT CAN HAPPEN IN DIFFERENT WAYS OF COURSE AND USUALLY COMES IN STAGES
JUST AS THERE WAS A POINT IN YOUR DEVELOPMENT AS A CHILD WHEN YOU SENSE OF SELF AND OF
WE EACH LIVE IN THE SHADOW OF A PERSONAL APOCALYPSE
OR A GAME OF THRONES MARATHON TONIGHT
WHILE PROCRASTINATING ON WRITING AN ESSAY YOU STUDY FOR YOUR MATH TEST
THEY REDUCED THE FOOTPRINT FROM 1700 MILES TO 700 MILES
WE ARE NOT GOING TO FEED OUR WAY OUT OF POVERTY
AND FROM EMMEN JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO THEY TRANSFERRED HIM TO A SHELTER IN HOOGEVEEN
AND TO OVERCOME ALL THESE TRAUMAS I THINK THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO RESTART THEIR LIVES
AND THEY WORKED TOGETHER FOR A FEW DAYS AND AFTER A WEEK OR SO SHE PHONED ME AND SHE SAID
SO I THINK WE DUTCH ORGANIZATIONS NGOS VOLUNTARY GROUPS
IT WAS A FRIGHTENING JOURNEY TO COME TO THE NETHERLANDS
MOHAS STUDIED FOR OVER SIX YEARS IN SYRIA TO BECOME A DENTIST AND THEN HE HAD TO FLEE HIS COUNTRY
THE HARDER IT IS TO REINTEGRATE INTO A WORKPLACE
BUT YOU KNOW IT'S A START
SO I THINK LET'S TRY IT
I DIDN'T FIND TWO OFFICIALS WORKING IN THE SAME DEPARTMENT
I'M SUPER SUPER ENTHUSIASTIC BECAUSE HIS WORK HIS HANDS
YOU KNOW HE REALLY HAS THIS IN HIS FINGERS
HE LOST HIS FAMILY HE COULDN'T BE TOGETHER WITH HIS FAMILY AGAIN
HE HAS TO LEAVE HIS COUNTRY WITHOUT HIS CHILDREN WITHOUT HIS GRANDCHILDREN
SO WE PUT UP A FACEBOOK POST AND 20 TAILORS RESPONDED
GALEB HAS HAD A LONG JOURNEY
BUT IT'S SIX HOURS THE EXPERIENCE
SO WHAT I'M DOING I'M STAGING THESE KINDS OF FEARS IN FRONT OF THE AUDIENCE
AND ONE VERY IMPORTANT PIECE I MADE IN THOSE DAYS WAS BALKAN BAROQUE
AND THEN AFTER THIS IS PERFORMANCE AND THEN EVERYTHING ELSE
PRIMARY SCHOOLS ARE FREE IN MALAWI
SO THAT'S THE FIRST THING
YOU COULDN'T SEE ANYTHING
BUT HOW DO WE KNOW THAT
IF IT WAS THE 24TH OF OCTOBER IT WAS A FRIDAY
SO PEOPLE WERE IN THE HOUSES SCREAMING ASKING FOR HELP
SO MANY PEOPLE ESPECIALLY ARISTOCRACY HAD GONE AWAY
SO THAT'S ANOTHER MYTH
AND THEN SO PEOPLE JUST IMAGINE STARTED TO SEE THOSE ROCKS COMING DOWN SMOKING ROCKS
AND THEN THERE IS ANOTHER ONE THE LAST ONE THAT IS SO POWERFUL IT GOES ALL THE WAY
BUT WHEN YOU FIND YOURSELF IN FRONT OF ONE OF THOSE BODIES INSIDE THE GLASS
YOU COULDN'T SEE ANYTHING
LET'S GO BACK TO POMPEII
SO IS THE DATE RIGHT OR NOT
IT WAS JUST LIKE A TV SET OF THAT TIME
BUT THEY WERE NOT THE KILLERS
THERE IS A STRANGE SMELL OF SULFUR JUST FROM THAT MOUNTAIN
SO THAT OF COURSE IS NO DEFINITE PROOF BUT THAT'S INTERESTING TO SEE THAT SUCH A KNOWN
AND WE I GUESS SHOULD PAY RESPECT TO THEM EVERY TIME
SO WHERE COULD YOU GO
IT'S EXACTLY WHERE THE BIG VOLCANO IS SITTING TODAY
PROBABLY YOU ALSO HAD EARTHQUAKES IN THAT PROCESS
SO THEY WANT TO GO AWAY BUT YOU HAVE SO MANY LAPILLI IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO OPEN THE DOOR
AND THAT WOULD PROBABLY TELL YOU THAT THE DATE OF THE ERUPTION WAS AROUND THE END
NOT A SINGLE ONE
IT VANISHED IN TIME
HE WAS A WITNESS
TO OPEN CRACK OPEN IN THAT MORNING
BUT WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE PLINY THE YOUNGER WROTE THAT IN A LETTER
EVERYONE WOULD GATHER THERE IN THE MORNING USUALLY JUST TO GET INFORMATION TO MEET FRIENDS
HE WAS STAYING AT THIRTY KILOMETERS AWAY
WHAT HAPPENED THEN
SO I ASKED MYSELF WHY DIDN'T THE PEOPLE GO AWAY
BUT OF COURSE THEY WOULD MAKE MISTAKES
ANOTHER ONE SAYS NINE DAYS BEFORE THE CALENDS OF NOVEMBER WHICH IS THE 24TH OF
IT FLOATS IN THE WATER
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE ARCHAEOLOGISTS FOUND
IT WOULD REACH MORE THAN 32 KILOMETERS OF HEIGHT IN THE HOUR WHICH IS THREE TIMES
RUNNING WATER WAS NOT THERE BECAUSE PROBABLY THE AQUEDUCT WAS BROKEN IN SOME PLACES MAYBE DUE
AND THEY SAW SOMETHING WEIRD
THEY ALL DIED WITHOUT DEFENDING THEMSELVES
THE FIRST ONE STOPS RIGHT AT THE SUBURBIA OF POMPEII
WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY
I TOLD YOU THERE WAS A LETTER
AND ANOTHER THING IS THAT YOU HAD LIKE A FOG COMING DOWN
IT DOESN'T REALLY KILL YOU
WE KNOW THAT EVERYTHING HAPPENED THE 24TH TWENTY FOURTH OF AUGUST IN 79 A
THESE ARE NOT PETRIFIED PEOPLE
BUT HOW DO WE KNOW THAT
YOU COULDN'T SEE THE ROADS JUST LIKE WHEN YOU HAVE A HEAVY SNOW
WE'VE SEEN SO MANY MOVIES READ SO MANY NOVELS TELLING US ABOUT THE BIG VOLCANO TELLING
AND THEN THEY WOULD COVER AND SEAL EVERYTHING
SO MAYBE PEOPLE WOULD GO THERE
AND THESE ASHES WERE CONTAINING PIECES OF GLASS ACTUALLY THAT WERE ACTUALLY
IT WAS A FRIEND THAT BETRAYED THEM
SO YOU HAD THE ROOF STARTING TO COLLAPSE
TODAY IT'S A TOWERING VOLCANO
PROBABLY YOU DON'T HAVE THE RAIN OF LAPILLI ANYMORE
FROM THAT DAY IT STARTED TO GROW AND BECOME WHAT WE SEE TODAY
SO IT IS NORMAL TO THINK THAT PEOPLE JUST HID IN THEIR HOUSES
WHAT IS A LAPILLI
SO NO ONE KNEW IT WAS A VOLCANO
AND LET'S TRY TO ANSWER THE QUESTION WOULD I HAVE SURVIVED
THERE WAS A SMALL MOUND WITH A CREST
YOU DIDN'T HAVE RUNNING WATER
SO THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED EXACTLY IN POMPEII
IT'S JUST LIKE A PIECE OF CORK
SO THAT MEANS THAT PROBABLY IT WAS A VERY COLD CLIMATE WHICH MAKES MORE
BUT IT'S OK MY MOM DOESN'T LIKE CURSE WORDS ANYWAYS
AND WE'RE GOING TO PLAY ON THIS PALETTE
AND AT SOME POINT CHRISTIAN WILL INTRODUCE THIS NOTE
HE'LL PLAY IT
IF I COME UP AND I DICTATE TO THE BAND THAT I WANT TO PLAY LIKE THIS AND I WANT THE MUSIC TO
IT HAS FAR MORE TO DO WITH WHAT I CAN PERCEIVE THAN WHAT IT IS THAT I CAN DO
WHEN YOU DO THAT YOU ENGAGE AND INSPIRE THE OTHER MUSICIANS AND THEY GIVE YOU MORE AND GRADUALLY IT BUILDS
SO I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU WE'RE GOING TO PLAY JUST FOR A SECOND
BUT THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED MAYBE MAYBE NOT
YOU HAVE NO TIME FOR PROJECTED IDEAS
SO IT'S UNPREDICTABLE
WE TEND TO SEE COMMONALITIES MORE THAN DIFFERENCES
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT IT CAN BE A TIME OF FRUITION AND GROWTH
PERHAPS WE STILL SUFFER FROM A PSYCHIC PAIN A WOUND
SELINGER WROTE THE FOLLOWING TO DESCRIBE WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO HIM
I THOUGHT OH MY GOSH
WE HAVE AGENCY
HOW DID THEY TREAT MY PARENTS
BUT VERY OFTEN MANY IF NOT MOST OF US WHEN WE HIT PUBERTY WE START WORRYING ABOUT FITTING IN AND BEING
WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS WHAT WE CAN DO TO MAKE THESE ADDED YEARS REALLY SUCCESSFUL AND
WOMEN START OFF WHOLE DON'T WE
NOW WHILE I WAS WRITING ABOUT THIS I CAME UPON A BOOK CALLED MAN'S SEARCH FOR MEANING BY VIKTOR
IN THIS ARTICLE MR
AND WE BECOME THE SUBJECTS AND OBJECTS OF OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES
AND GUESS WHAT
THEY BECOME THE NORM EVEN IF IT'S BAD FOR US BECAUSE IT CAUSES US STRESS AND ANXIETY
IT WASTES THE BODY BUT THE MIND REMAINS INTACT
AND I GOT SCARED
ONE THIRD OF IT IN FACT IS GENETIC
I DON'T WANT TO ROMANTICIZE AGING
WHO WERE MY GRANDPARENTS
PICASSO ONCE SAID IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO BECOME YOUNG
YOU SEE IF YOU HAVE OVER TIME REACTED NEGATIVELY TO PAST EVENTS AND PEOPLE NEURAL
I MEAN AS GIRLS WE'RE FEISTY YEAH
AND THERE ISN'T MUCH WE CAN DO ABOUT THAT
NOW LET ME SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE STAIRCASE WHICH MAY SEEM LIKE AN ODD METAPHOR FOR
BUT WHO WAS I
IF HOWEVER WE CAN GO BACK AND ALTER OUR RELATIONSHIP RE
TWO YEARS LATER HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH ALS COMMONLY KNOWN AS LOU GEHRIG'S DISEASE
VIKTOR FRANKL WAS A GERMAN PSYCHIATRIST WHO'D SPENT FIVE YEARS IN A NAZI CONCENTRATION CAMP
NEIL SELINGER TO ME IS THE EMBODIMENT OF MOUNTING THE STAIRCASE IN HIS THIRD ACT
AND YOU'RE ABLE TO GO BACK AND FORGIVE THEM
PERHAPS OUR PARENTS SUFFERED FROM DEPRESSION
SOME OF IT IS A MATTER OF LUCK
AND IF WE CAN DO THAT IT WILL NOT JUST BE FOR OURSELVES
IT'S LIKE RESETTING A THERMOSTAT
BUT NOW THAT I AM ACTUALLY SMACK DAB IN THE MIDDLE OF MY OWN THIRD ACT I REALIZE I'VE
YOU REALIZE YOU'RE STILL YOURSELF MAYBE EVEN MORE SO
WE ARE THE SUBJECTS OF OUR OWN LIVES
PERHAPS WE FEEL THAT MANY OF OUR RELATIONSHIPS HAVE NOT HAD CLOSURE
ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO I READ AN ARTICLE IN THE NEW YORK TIMES
THAT'S THE METAPHOR THE OLD METAPHOR
OLDER WOMEN ARE THE LARGEST DEMOGRAPHIC IN THE WORLD
AND HE WROTE THAT WHILE HE WAS IN THE CAMP HE COULD TELL SHOULD THEY EVER BE
THIS POTENTIAL IS NOT FOR THE LUCKY FEW
AND OVER TIME THESE NEURAL PATHWAYS BECOME HARDWIRED
HOW DO WE LIVE IT SUCCESSFULLY
WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE NEW METAPHOR FOR AGING
IF WE CAN GO BACK AND REDEFINE OURSELVES AND BECOME WHOLE THIS WILL
WHICH OF THE PEOPLE WOULD BE OK AND WHICH WOULD NOT
IT'S REFLECTING ON THE EXPERIENCES THAT WE'VE HAD THAT MAKES US WISE AND THAT HELPS US
PERHAPS THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO LOVE US BEYOND HOW WE PERFORMED IN THE WORLD
AGE AS POTENTIAL
AS I DIMINISHED I GREW
AND IF WE CAN MAINTAIN THE MORE POSITIVE FEELINGS ABOUT THE PAST THAT BECOMES THE
ENTROPY MEANS THAT EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD EVERYTHING IS IN A STATE OF DECLINE AND DECAY THE ARCH
THINK ABOUT SOMETHING IN YOUR HOMETOWN RIGHT NOW THAT'S ALWAYS BOTHERED YOU
THEY ALL THOUGHT I WAS SOME CRAZY SIXTH GRADER
IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW YOU EXPRESS YOURSELF JUST THAT YOU DO IT WITH PASSION AND THAT IT'S IN YOUR OWN UNIQUE VOICE IN
GENERATE BUZZ THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA
BECAUSE WHAT I'VE STARTED LEARNING WITH THE STUFF THAT I'VE BEEN DOING IS IF YOU WORK REALLY HARD TO CREATE SOMETHING INTERESTING AND
AND IT WAS AT THAT MOMENT THAT MY SECOND IDENTITY WAS BORN
AND I DID THIS FOR MONTHS BUT NOBODY WOULD RESPOND TO ME
I'M NOT HAPPY
SO I'M DOING IT FOR THEM AND THEY ARE DOING IT FOR ME
WE ARE MEMBERS OF AN INVISIBLE TRIBE
CAN YOU GET THOSE FOLK TALKING
SO THINKING ABOUT THOSE THINGS TOGETHER FEELS RIGHT
SO IT'S REASONABLE TO SAY THAT GRAND CROSSING IS ALREADY IN THE PROCESS OF BEING SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN IT
I KNOW THAT IF I SAY I HAVE GOT TO VERSUS I REALLY WANT YOU MY ENTIRE PHYSIOLOGY
WHAT A GIFT FUTURE DAYS ARE
AND SEEING THE WORLD THROUGH HER EYES REALLY WAS KIND OF LIKE SEEING IT THROUGH THE EYES OF A CHILD
I NOW LOOK IN THE MIRROR EACH MORNING AND I ASK MYSELF IF TODAY WERE THE FIRST DAY
HOW MANY OF YOU ACTUALLY DO THAT EACH DAY
TO HEAR HER TELL THE STORY SHE WOKE UP ON THAT MORNING AND SAID UH
SO I WOULD ARGUE THAT WE CAN DEAL WITH DAY TO DAY ROUTINE AND RESPONSIBILITY WHILE PURSUING OUR
AND JANESSA STARTED WRITING AGAIN AFTER DAY 181 BECAUSE THERE WERE MORE DAYS ON THE
IF WE LIVE EACH DAY FULL OF WONDER AND APPRECIATION WHILE DISCOVERING A
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ALL OR NOTHING
HAVE YOU SEEN THEM
SHE STARTED WRITING AGAIN
YES I DO THINK THAT KNOWING WE ARE GOING TO DIE SOMEDAY CAN BE A MOTIVATOR FOR SOME
AND HER ONE THROUGH FIVE GAVE HER JOY REGARDLESS OF OUTCOME
THERE ARE A FEW THINGS ABOUT LIVING EACH DAY LIKE IT'S YOUR LAST THAT DON'T MAKE SENSE TO ME
I FOUND WHERE SEVERAL PEOPLE APPARENTLY HAVE SAID IT THROUGHOUT HISTORY EVEN AS FAR BACK AS THE ROMAN
LIKE MOST OF YOU I'VE BEEN HEARING IT MOST OF MY LIFE AND MOST RECENTLY WHILE WATCHING
NOT GOING TO GO THERE
WHERE I WORK WE ALSO HAVE A TEAM OF EDITORS BUT WE ALSO RELY HEAVILY ON OTHER TOOLS
SO THAT'S A BIG PART OF WHAT WE DO
WHERE DO WE START
HOW DO WE EXPRESS OURSELVES
AND PEOPLE WILL SIGN UP FOR A 45 DAY COURSE ON BUILDING A BICYCLE
PART OF IT WILL BE WRONG AND IT DOESN'T MATTER
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN SCARED TO GO
ONE IT FREED OUR FIVE KIDS FROM FOLLOWING IN OUR STEPS OUR SHADOW THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT
BECAUSE THE FIRST WHY YOU ALWAYS HAVE A GOOD ANSWER FOR
BUT ALSO FOR GRAMMAR
SPEND AN AFTERNOON SPEND A WHOLE DAY TALK TO ANYBODY YOU WANT
DON'T TELL US WHERE YOU ARE
IT'S ABOUT SPIRITUALITY CULTURE VALUES
WE ENDED UP WITH THE RESERVES
I'M NOT A YOUTH
YOU CAN'T BE SAYING THAT ABOUT ME
WHO WAS NOT CONSIDERED AN INDIAN
WE ENDED UP WITH THE RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS
WE WANTED LAND
BUT I ALSO LOVE THIS QUOTE BECAUSE IT IMPLIES SOMETHING REALLY IMPORTANT
BECAUSE YOU HAVE ALWAYS HAD A HOME INSIDE THE FOUR WALLS OF YOUR OWN SKIN BUT GIRL I
I WOULD HIDE BEHIND A LOT OF ABSTRACTIONS AND KIND OF BEAT AROUND THE BUSH
I'VE BEEN SO ADDICTED TO THAT FEELING EVER SINCE
NOT ONLY FOR OUR MENTAL HEALTH BUT ALSO FOR THE HEALTH OF THE SOCIETY THAT WE'RE ALL IN
I WAS COMING TO TERMS WITH MY SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND NOT SEEING IT AS SOMETHING SHAMEFUL ANYMORE
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH SOME PROCESS TO GET IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT ONLY ARTISTS HAVE
THAT ALONE IS REASON ENOUGH TO TELL IT
SO WE END UP HAVING TO HAVE THESE REALLY CRAFTED IDENTITIES
BUT THEN CONVERSELY SOMEONE WOULD DO A POEM WITH EXPERIENCES AND OPINIONS THAT WERE COMPLETELY SEPARATE FROM MY OWN
I THINK IT IS
FAST FORWARD ABOUT FOUR MONTHS LATER I WENT TO GO SEE SARAH KAY PERFORM IN PERSON
THERE ARE SO MANY INDIVIDUAL GROUPS THAT COULD REALLY BENEFIT FROM THIS BUT ONE THAT I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT I HAVE SOME INSIGHT INTO
THAT IS VALIDATE MYSELF AND THAT SOUNDS HUGE
THIS ISN'T FOR NO REASON
THIS WAS REALLY CRAZY POINT OF MY LIFE WHERE I WAS FINALLY REALLY PAST THAT EATING DISORDER
THAT IS GIVING MYSELF PERMISSION TO EXPERIMENT AND TRY THINGS OUT AND LET MY STORY BE HOW
IT FEELS LIKE I'M TAKING ALL OF THIS CONFUSION AND EMOTION AND ALL THOSE OTHER KINDS OF ART BUILDING UP INSIDE OF ME
MY MOTIVATION FOR DOING THAT IS THINKING THAT IF I CAN DO THIS THE FOURTH STEP WILL HAPPEN NATURALLY
BUT I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE TIME TO FREAK OUT SO THEY CALL MY NAME I GET UP TO THE STAGE SHAKING I'M READING OUT OF MY
IT IMPLIES THAT WE ALREADY HAVE ART IN OUR MOUTHS ALL OF US
SHE WAS REALLY VULNERABLE BUT SO BRAVE AT THE SAME TIME
BECAUSE I HAD WRITTEN FOR A WHILE BUT I ALWAYS THOUGHT OF IT AS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE REALLY INTERNAL
THERE WOULD BE LINES IN THERE WHERE I WOULD JUST THINK YES I FELT THAT AND THOUGHT THAT SO MANY TIMES AND JUST NEVER KNEW HOW TO
THIS TED TALK WAS BY AN INCREDIBLE POET AND JUST AMAZING HUMAN BEING NAMED SARAH KAY
THAT FOURTH STEP IS INSPIRING OTHERS TO HAVE THE SAME PROCESS
SOMETIMES THAT'S GOING TO AN OPEN MIC NIGHT SOMETIMES THAT'S JUST POSTING A POEM ON TUMBLR
BUT IT'S REALLY AS SIMPLE AS JUST REMINDING MYSELF THAT IF I DON'T TELL MY STORY NO ONE IS GOING TO
I WAS OBSESSED INSTANTLY
BEFORE SHE WENT ON THERE WAS WHAT I THOUGHT WAS AN OPEN MIC NIGHT GOING ON
HONESTY INSPIRES OTHER HONESTY AND IF YOU CAN FIND WAYS TO FUSE THESE TOGETHER THERE'S SO MUCH
SO WE FEEL EVEN MORE ISOLATED
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU HAD TO MEMORIZE POEMS I DIDN'T KNOW SOME OF THESE SLAM FORMALITIES WHERE YOU SNAP AND POEMS ARE PRETTY
WE SEE THESE THINGS ALL THE TIME
I KNEW I WANTED TO TELL MY STORY AND I KNEW THAT I WANTED TO HELP PEOPLE IN THE PROCESS I JUST HAD NO IDEA HOW THAT
THERE'S A LOT OF AMAZING THINGS ABOUT TEENAGE GIRL CULTURE BUT THERE'S A LOT OF REALLY TOXIC THINGS
I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT IF JUST ONE OF YOU GOES HOME TODAY AND DECIDES TO SPIT OUT AND SHARE A LITTLE BIT OF ART
BUT THEN IF WE IGNORE THAT AND DO IT ANYWAY WE'RE NOT REALLY TAKEN SERIOUSLY AFTERWARDS
UNTIL THIS MOMENT
SARAH WASN'T DOING ANY OF THAT
BUT WE DO NEED TO GIVE OURSELVES THIS FREEDOM BECAUSE MAYBE THE BEST WAY OF TELLING YOUR STORY IS THROUGH A FICTIONAL VOICE
THEN THERE'S AN EQUAL AND OPPOSITE PRESSURE ON TEENAGE BOYS TO WITHHOLD THEIR STORIES AND THERE ARE JUST THESE GAPING HOLES
WE HAVE IT BECAUSE WE'RE HUMANS
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I FOUND OUT PRETTY ACCIDENTALLY
SECOND STEP IS HARD BECAUSE I TEND TO BE PERFECTIONIST
YOU TAUGHT ME HOW TO TURN EVERY EYE CONTACT INTO SILENT WHISPERS SILENT FINGER
IT TURNS OUT THAT THIS WAS THE QUALIFYING ROUND TO GET ONTO THE SAY WORD POMONA SLAM TEAM
I WAS READY TO TALK ABOUT IT
MAYBE IT'S VISUALLY YOU DON'T KNOW UNTIL YOU TRY AND THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH TALENT AND EVERYTHING TO DO WITH CHECKING
IF SHE'S REALLY ATTRACTIVE GREAT BUT THAT'S ALL WE KNOW ABOUT HER
I DO STOP RIPPING MYSELF APART AS A RESULT BECAUSE I SEE SO PLAINLY RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME THAT MY STORY SHOULD BE
IT'S ALWAYS SCARY THIS DOESN'T GET EASIER BUT IT'S SO IMPORTANT
BECAUSE THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I NEEDED YOU TO TURN MY TELESCOPE TO THE WRONG SIGHT TO MAKE EVERYTHING
MY WAY OF TELLING MY STORY HAS BEEN WRITING FOR PRETTY MUCH AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER BUT MOST RECENTLY WRITING SPOKEN WORD
THE THIRD STEP IS WHAT TAKES US FROM BEING IN AN INTERNAL PROCESS TO SOMETHING THAT HELPS OTHERS
IF SHE'S DEALING WITH SOMETHING LIKE A MENTAL ILLNESS THAT MENTAL ILLNESS IS ALMOST ALWAYS EITHER TRIVIALIZED OR REALLY
MY WAY OF DOING THAT TODAY IS GOING TO BE SHARING WHAT I'LL CALL MY STEPS FOR SPITTING OUT THE ART IN MY MOUTH
PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE WERE SNAPPING AND RESPONDING AND I KNEW THAT I WAS IN THIS MOMENT OF REALLY INCREDIBLE
THIS IS AN INVITATION TO STOP RIPPING YOURSELF APART
IT WAS THIS TIME IN MY LIFE WHERE I JUST STARTED TO LIKE MYSELF
HOW ARE WE GOING TO WANT TO TELL OUR STORIES IF WE FEEL LIKE OUR STORIES ARE WRONG AND WEIRD
SOME OF MY FRIENDS MADE ME SIGN UP AND I'M LIKE OK I'LL DO IT
SO THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS WE NEED TO REALLY THINK DEEPLY ABOUT
SOME PEOPLE CALL THAT THE HEAD BRAIN SOME PEOPLE JUST CALL IT THE BRAIN BUT ACTUALLY YOU HAVE A BRAIN AROUND YOUR HEART
AND THAT'S THE BASIS OF THE EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE ACTUALLY AND IT'S THE BASIS AS YOU'LL SEE IN THE MOMENT OF SOCIAL
THE BRAINSTEMS ARE ALSO GOING TO HAVE THE FIGHT FLIGHT FREEZE REACTION
THERE'S ALL SORTS OF LAYERS TO IT AND IT MAKES MAPS TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD
LET'S DO THE HAND MODEL
TO DEMONSTRATE HOW THIS WORKS UP LEWIS WHY DON'T YOU COME UP
THAT'S BASICALLY THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WE MEAN BY THE NERVOUS SYSTEM
WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS HAND MODEL OF THE BRAIN AND I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU ALL HOW TO DO THIS
THIS BRAIN SITS IN YOUR BODY WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE BRAIN AND THE BODY
SO HOW DID MR
ROGERS HAD FOR ALL OF US AND TEACH NOT ONLY READING WRITING ARITHMETIC VERY IMPORTANT 3 RS
FROM ROCK DRAWINGS IN CAVES DATING BACK THOUSANDS OF YEARS TO THE LATEST IPHONE
SHORTOLOGY BECAME A PROJECT OF 13 BOOKS HUNDREDS OF STORIES CHARACTERS
WE WANTED TO CREATE SOMETHING WHICH COULD HELP ANYONE TO EXPRESS IDEAS
YOU'VE GOT TO RUN BACK HOME BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY YOU'RE GOING TO FUNCTION WITHOUT IT
IT'S HOW WE DO WHAT WE DO
HE REINVENTED THE WAY THAT WE PURCHASE SHOES BECAUSE HE HAD A PASSION FOR DELIVERING HAPPINESS
YOU'D GET ON THE BIKE IT SWAYS IT WOBBLES YOU FALL
I HAD A DINNER PARTY A FEW WEEKS AGO AND I WAS RUNNING AROUND AND I HAD NO IDEA IF PEOPLE ACTUALLY ENJOYED
THESE DEVICES ARE WHAT WE CALL THE INTERNET OF THINGS
NO HE HAD ALREADY MADE MILLIONS AND LOST IT
HIS TEAM CREATED ZAPPOS
WHY DID HE DO ALL THAT
WE ALL KNOW THAT SINKING FEELING WHEN YOU THINK YOU FORGOT YOUR MOBILE DEVICE
MY FAMILY AND I ACTUALLY EMIGRATED HERE FROM IRAN DURING THE WAR
HE THOUGHT WE WERE NUTS
SO GROWING UP HERE MY FATHER WAS HEAVILY INTO TECHNOLOGY SO I NATURALLY FELL INTO IT
AND WHILE THIS GOLDFISH LIVES IN A VERY SAFE ENVIRONMENT IT'S ALSO VERY LIMITING IN MOST EVERY WAY
WE SEE CHAOS OCCUR AT TIMES IN BUSINESS MERGERS NATURAL DISASTERS AND HORRIFIC EVENTS LIKE 9 11
IT JUST MAKES IT REALLY HARD
THEY EITHER PLAY WITH MATERIALS UNTIL IDEAS BEGIN TO MANIFEST OR THEY PLAY WITH IDEAS
I ACTUALLY LEARNED THIS FROM A GROUP OF TEACHERS
THEY PLAY IN A NUMBER OF WAYS
IF ARTISTS ARE DOING THIS CAN'T YOU IMAGINE IF ART EDUCATION WAS A PLACE WHERE WE
WE FIND THAT IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO ENGAGE OUR STUDENTS IN CREATIVE WORK IN PARTICULAR OPEN ENDED
WE ALSO KNOW THE CREATIVITY SCORES IN THIS COUNTRY ARE ON THE DECLINE THAT TORRANCE CREATIVITY
WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT
THAT DISCOMFORT AND THAT DISCOMFORT IS AMBIGUITY IT'S NOT KNOWING
THANK YOU FRANS DE WAAL WHEREVER YOU ARE I LOVE YOU AND I'D GIVE ANYTHING TO MEET YOU
WHO ARE MY FRIENDS
IN THE RESEARCH PHASE OF THE PROJECT AT INTERVAL WE PARTNERED WITH A COMPANY CALLED
AFTER WE HAD DONE THAT WITH A PRETTY LARGE TEAM OF PEOPLE AND DISCOVERED WHAT WE THOUGHT THE SALIENT ISSUES WERE
TO EXERCISE THE LOVE OF SOCIAL COMPLEXITY AND THE NARRATIVE INTELLIGENCE THAT DRIVES MOST OF THEIR
THE OTHER TITLE THAT WE LAUNCHED IS CALLED SECRET PATHS IN THE FOREST WHICH ADDRESSES THE MORE FANTASY ORIENTED INNER LIVES OF
AND INTERVAL RESEARCH IS KIND OF THE LIVING EXAMPLE OF HOW THAT CAN BE TRUE
SO DAVID AND I DECIDED TO GO FIND OUT THROUGH THE BEST RESEARCH WE COULD MUSTER WHAT IT WOULD
WE SPENT TWO AND A HALF YEARS CONDUCTING RESEARCH WE SPENT ANOTHER YEAR AND A HALF IN ADVANCE DEVELOPMENT
IT HAD TO HAVE A RIDER
AND I WENT AWAY
SO BY NOW I HAD DEVELOPED A NEW PEDAGOGICAL METHOD SO I APPLIED THAT
AND THEY SAID SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING TO ME
HOW WILL WE COME TO KNOW
AND JUST ONE LAST THING
I WENT 300 MILES OUT OF DELHI INTO A REALLY REMOTE VILLAGE WHERE THE CHANCES OF A PASSING SOFTWARE
IT'S ABOUT LETTING IT HAPPEN
I FOUND A VILLAGE
THEY'LL GET A ZERO
BUT HOW WILL WE KNOW
THE LIGHTS ARE TURNED ON AND OFF BY THE CLOUD ETC
THAT'S MY WISH
I SAID I HAVEN'T THE FOGGIEST IDEA
I GOT 200 IN THE FIRST TWO WEEKS
WHERE DOES IT STOP
THERE'S A GREAT DOCUMENT PRODUCED BY TED WHICH TELLS YOU HOW TO DO IT
I SAID IF YOU WISH TO
I'M NOT SAYING THEY'RE BROKEN
IT WAS THREE FEET OFF THE GROUND AND THEY SAID WHAT IS THIS
EVERYTHING'S DONE FROM THE CLOUD
SO ALL THE SYRIAN DISSIDENTS USED FACEBOOK TO ORGANIZE
BUT WE'VE KIND OF FORGOTTEN IT IN OUR FEAR OF TERRORISM OR OTHER MODERN THREATS
WHETHER IT'S SETTING UP YOUR OWN EMAIL SERVER OR USING ENCRYPTION OR BREAKING COPY PROTECTION THE TECHNOLOGIES ARE
AND IT'S A COMBINATION OF THINGS
BUT WHEN BIG INSTITUTIONS FINALLY FIGURED IT OUT THEY HAD MORE RAW POWER TO MAGNIFY AND THEY GOT EVEN MORE
IS THERE ACTUALLY NO ROOM FOR FREEDOM LIBERTY AND SOCIAL CHANGE IN THE TECHNOLOGICAL FUTURE
IS THE QUICK OR THE STRONG
IT'S ALSO CRITICAL
AND WE NEED TO PRESERVE IT
THERE'S ALSO A CRIME RATE THAT SOCIETY IS WILLING TO TOLERATE
AND AGAIN IT'S A LONG UNDERSTOOD MECHANISM FOR CHECKING POWER
IT'S COURTS THAT ACT AS THIRD PARTY ADVOCATES IT'S LEGISLATORS THAT UNDERSTAND TECHNOLOGIES IT'S A VIBRANT
BUT WE ALL HAVE A DUTY TO TACKLE THIS PROBLEM
OVERSIGHT IS THE SECOND THING
THE TERRORISTS OR THE MEDIA INDUSTRY VS
THE PIRATES OR CHINA VS
TO THE EXTENT THE POWERLESS HAVE ACCESS TO IT THEY GAIN IN POWER TO EXTENT THE ALREADY POWER HAVE ACCESS TO IT
THE INSTITUTIONAL ARE SLOWER BUT ABLE TO USE POWER MORE EFFECTIVELY
ON THE ONE SIDE IT'S TRADITIONAL POWER THINK OF ORGANIZED INSTITUTIONAL POWERS LIKE GOVERNMENTS AND LARGE MULTI
AND IN MANY CASES THE INTERESTS ARE ALIGNING
AND THE POLICE WHO ARE LIKE TRAINED ON AGATHA CHRISTIE NOVELS
AND THE KEY TO ALL THIS IS ACCESS TO DATA
BUT SHE KNEW
SO I HAD AN IDEA
WE SHOW COURAGE
THERE IS SHOCK FOLLOWED BY A LONG SILENCE
AND I FAILED A LOT
WHAT CAN I DO
OR HOW WAS THE CAKE
AND THE SMALLPOX VACCINATION IS BOVINE BASED BECAUSE OF THAT DAIRY FARMER
AND SHE LOOKED ME RIGHT IN THE EYE AND SHE SAID THEY WILL NOT ALWAYS TREAT YOU WELL
AND ONE DAY MY COACH HAD ME DO A DRILL WHERE I HAD TO SWIM TO ONE END OF A 25 METER POOL WITHOUT TAKING A
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT AT ALL
NOW COLOR BLINDNESS IN MY VIEW DOESN'T MEAN THAT THERE'S NO RACIAL DISCRIMINATION AND THERE'S
AND EVERY SINGLE TIME I FAILED I HAD TO START OVER
AND MY COACH LOOKED ME AT ME AND HE SAID MELLODY THAT WAS NOT A BREATH HOLDING EXERCISE
WE HAVE TO BE COLOR BRAVE
BUT I'LL BE THE FIRST ONE TO TELL YOU THIS SUBJECT MATTER CAN BE HARD AWKWARD
AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU I ACTUALLY FOR A MOMENT WAS A BIT AFRAID
I CITE THOSE STATISTICS AROUND CORPORATE BOARD DIVERSITY BECAUSE THEY ARE REAL AND I STAND HERE TODAY
I CALLED A FRIEND WHO WAS IN NEW YORK AT ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL MEDIA COMPANIES IN THE WORLD AND SHE
IF YOU'RE PART OF A HIRING PROCESS OR AN ADMISSIONS PROCESS YOU CAN BE COLOR BRAVE
I DID NOT UNDERSTAND
THE BLOOD DRAINS FROM HER FACE
THERE ARE LITERALLY NO WORDS RIGHT
MY FRIEND HAROLD FORD CALLS ME
AS CITIZENS I'M ASKING YOU NOT TO LEAVE ANY CHILD BEHIND
THAT DRILL WAS TO MAKE YOU COMFORTABLE BEING UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE THAT'S HOW MOST OF US SPEND OUR
MAY WE ALL BE GRANTED A GRACE OF MERCY
AND EVERY DAY EVERY DAY WE WAKE UP WITH THE RULE OF THE MILITIAS AND
OUR SOCIETY SHAPED BY A REVOLUTIONARY MINDSET BECAME MORE POLARIZED AND HAS
WHY DOES OUR SOCIETY CONTINUE TO BE POLARIZED AND DOMINATED
THEY HAVE DIGITIZED MILLIONS OF BOOKS
IF YOU DO THAT YOU MIGHT THINK OH GREAT
WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE
THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO RESIST THEM
SO I WAS REALLY FOCUSING ON JUST STAYING ON THE TRAIL AND AT SOME POINT IN THAT RIDE THERE WAS NO ME
NOW THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT HERE
AND THEIR HEADS DIDN'T EXPLODE
WE JUST HAVE TO GET OUT OF OUR OWN WAY
WE CAN REALLY START TO PAY ATTENTION
THAT'S THE BEST WAY I CAN DESCRIBE IT
AND THEY ALL REPORTED A VERY GOOD CORRESPONDENCE WITH INCREASED ACTIVITY IN THIS POSTERIOR CINGULATE AND GETTING IN THEIR OWN WAY
WHAT DOES THIS REALLY FEEL LIKE
IT WAS EFFORTLESS
IT WAS SELFLESS
IT WAS IMMENSELY JOYFUL
THEY EVENTUALLY CHARGED ME AND 11 OTHER PEOPLE WITH CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT CRIMINAL DAMAGE
I DO NOT KNOW WHERE WE ARE GOING
I WOULD ASK YOU TO THINK ABOUT THOSE BOUNDARIES THAT ARE BEING DRAWN AROUND YOUR EXISTENCE AND THE WAY THEY ARE CHANGING YOUR
BUT THIS IS WHAT WE DO WHEN WE ARE YOUNG
WE SOLVED OUR CURIOSITY IN THE OBVIOUS WAY WE WAITED UNTIL TWO IN THE MORNING WE JUMPED OVER THE FENCES WE
AND HOW AND WHY PEOPLE REAPPROPRIATE THESE PLACES
THAT WILL NOT GUARANTEE THAT WE ACTUALLY CONVERGE TOWARD A SINGLE STORY OF VENICE BUT PROBABLY WE CAN ACTUALLY
MAYBE THERE'S NOT A SINGLE MAP
HOW DO WE DO THAT
THEY ARE WELL STRUCTURED IN MANY CASES
WILL COME AND IT DEVELOPS AND DEVELOPS AND IT'S GETTING BETTER AND BETTER
YOU CAN KEEP IT TO YOURSELF
AND AS YOU'LL SEE IN THIS SIMULATION AS THEY INTERACT THEY GAIN POINTS AS IT WERE THEY GROW AND WHEN THEY'VE DOUBLED
I'M OFFERING THE METAPHOR OF A STAIRCASE IN THE MIND
I'M SAYING WE ARE HOMO DUPLEX AND THIS STAIRCASE TAKES US UP FROM THE PROFANE LEVEL TO THE LEVEL OF THE
THE SLOWEST ROWERS THE WEAKEST ROWERS ARE GOING TO GET CUT FROM THE TEAM
SO WHILE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO STOP A MEME SUCH AS THEDRESS FROM SPREADING ONCE IT
AND NOT MANY DISEASES OR POPULATIONS BEHAVE QUITE SO SIMPLY
IT STOPS BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE SHARING THE DRESS CAN'T FIND ANY NEW PEOPLE TO SHARE IT WITH
IT'S USED TO INVESTIGATE THE CAUSES AND SPREAD OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND TO HELP DEVELOP STRATEGIES TO
BUT INFECTIOUS DISEASES ISN'T THE ONLY APPLICATION OF MATHEMATICS TO HEALTH PROBLEMS
THAT ACTUALLY CAUSE DISEASE VIRUSES AND BACTERIA
SO WE CAN RUN VIRTUAL EXPERIMENTS TO ANSWER QUESTIONS LIKE
HOW MANY CASES COULD WE PREVENT IF WE HAD AN EFFECTIVE VACCINE AGAINST EBOLA FOR EXAMPLE
AND SO THE SHARING NUMBERS DROP TO ZERO
SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT HOW THEDRESS SPREADS THROUGH A POPULATION
SO WHY DOES THE DRESS STOP SPREADING
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NO LONGER SHARING THE DRESS NEVER QUITE REACHES BACK UP TO A POPULATION OF TEN MILLION
YOU SHOULD BE WORKING RIGHT NOW
YOU'RE NOT DOING IT NOW
AND THAT HAS TO HAPPEN WITH BIOTECH
THEY'RE ARTISTS CARPENTERS CHEFS AND ATHLETES
AND THE RESULTS OF THE PROGRAM WERE AMAZING
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THESE JOBS WHEN WE'RE NO LONGER DRIVING OUR CARS OR COOKING OUR FOOD OR EVEN DIAGNOSING OUR OWN
SO MY TEAM AND I DESIGNED A PROTOTYPING CONTEST THAT INVITED ANYONE TO BUILD ANYTHING THAT THEY WANTED
AND AS WE REDESIGN WORK FOR AN ERA OF INTELLIGENT MACHINES I INVITE YOU ALL TO WORK ALONGSIDE ME TO BRING MORE
WE STARTED BY INVITING PEOPLE TO REENVISION WHAT IT IS THEY COULD BRING TO A TEAM
AND IT'S NOT JUST BLUE COLLAR JOBS THAT ARE AT RISK
THINK ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW AND WHAT THEY DO ON SATURDAYS
SO EVEN THE SMARTEST HIGHEST PAID PEOPLE WILL BE AFFECTED BY THIS CHANGE
BUT I BELIEVE THAT IF WE START TAKING STEPS RIGHT NOW TO CHANGE THE NATURE OF WORK WE CAN NOT ONLY CREATE
BUT SECOND WE HAVE ACCIDENTALLY MADE IT SO THAT MILLIONS OF WORKERS AROUND THE WORLD HAVE UNBELIEVABLY
AND WHAT BETTER WAY THAN WITH TECHNOLOGY
I THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THE REST
BEFORE THIS TIME EDUCATION WAS BASED AROUND CONNECTING WITH ELDERS AND CONNECTING WITH
AS THE WESTERN SOCIETY BECAME THE NORM SO DID MODERN SCHOOLING
PROGRESS CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED THROUGH CUTTING CORNERS CREATING SHORTCUTS AND MAKING THINGS MORE
I'M AMAZED WHEN A SHOOTING STAR STREAKS ACROSS THE SKY
GRAVITATIONAL WAVES ARE RIPPLES IN THE CURVATURE OF SPACE TIME
A LOT OF THE INDIAN PROBLEMS ARE RELATED TO THE IDEOLOGY OF CASTE AND OTHER THINGS
BUT TODAY FINALLY AFTER ECONOMIC REFORMS AND ECONOMIC GROWTH I THINK THE NOTION THAT CITIES
THIS POLICY IS CAUSING GRIDLOCK
EVERY PROVINCE HAD ITS OWN MARKET FOR AGRICULTURE
FORTY PERCENT OF THOSE PREPAID PHONES ARE RECHARGED AT LESS THAN 20 CENTS
BUT TODAY DEMOCRACY HAS BECOME A BOTTOM UP PROCESS WHERE EVERYBODY HAS REALIZED THE BENEFITS OF
AND THEREFORE DEMOCRACY HAS BECOME EMBEDDED
KIDS GET SMART PHONES AND LAPTOPS WHILE THEY ARE STILL IN PRIMARY SCHOOL AND THEY ALSO GET A LOT OF
THIS MEANS THAT NORWEGIAN GIRLS MAY BE FAR LESS FREE THAN WHAT WE MIGHT THINK THEY ARE BECAUSE THEY ARE GROWING UP
AND BECAUSE WE HAVE TAKEN THIS FOR GRANTED WHILE AT THE SAME TIME GIVING KIDS ENORMOUS ACCESS TO
THIS IS LINKED TO THE FACT THAT WE ARE BOTH A VERY RICH AND A VERY LIBERAL COUNTRY
IF YOU ADD THE TIME THEY SPEND WATCHING TV AND MOVIES READING MAGAZINES AND
BUT THE MEDIA OFTEN PORTRAITS THEM AS TIMELESS FACTS AND WHEN WE SPEND UP TO 10 HOURS A
MOST PRESS MAINSTREAM AND PRESS COVERAGE ALSO CONTINUE TO RELY ON MEN AS EXPERTS IN THE
OR WOULD THAT MAKE ME A COWARD
WE WERE WALKING ALONG COURT AVENUE WE GET TO THE COURT AVENUE BRIDGE AND HE'S HOLDING MY HAND WHICH I WAS SO
NOTICE THAT I'M UP HERE AS A CISGENDERED WHITE MALE WHO'S VERY COMFORTABLE IDENTIFYING AS A MALE
I KNEW SOMETHING WAS GOING TO HAPPEN
AFTER I GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE I'M GOING TO GO INTO THE WORLD OF THEATER BUT WHEN I'M NOT WORKING AT A THEATER COMPANY
I LIVE HERE IN IOWA
I CAN GIVE TO ANYONE
I WAS GOING TO WORK ON THE SECOND ONE NEXT
NUMBER ONE I DON'T HAVE AN INDIAN ACCENT I HAVE A PAKISTANI ACCENT OK
SO OUR APOLOGIES
TODAY I BROUGHT TWO RECENT PROJECTS AS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS
SO WE CREATED SOME BUDGET SAVINGS THAT WE USED TO IMPLEMENT THE PROJECT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
AND THE OTHER MAJOR PROBLEM IS THAT MOST ACADEMICS DON'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF INCENTIVE TO PUBLISH OUTSIDE OF THESE PRESTIGIOUS
CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE
THEY'RE ALL 3D PRINTED NOW
WE'VE HEARD ABOUT DRIVERLESS CARS
SO WE'VE MOVED FROM A PROTOTYPING TOOL TO A CUSTOMIZATION TOOL AND NOW WE'RE MOVING TO A MANUFACTURING TOOL
EVERY TIME WE ENGAGE WITH A NEW CLIENT THE STEPS MULTIPLY AND THERE ARE HUNDREDS ON STEPS IN THIS VALUE CHAIN
3D PRINTERS YOU CAN BUY FOR 200 OR 300 DOLLARS NOW TO MAKE PROTOTYPES
BUT MORE THAN THAT EVEN
SO JOIN ME ON THIS JOURNEY BRIEFLY AS AN INSPIRATION FOR HOW YOU MAY BE ABLE TO ENGAGE
300000 PHONE LINES FOR THEN ABOUT 155 MILLION PEOPLE
YOU HAVE THAT MOSTLY BECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE HERE
THERE ARE DOZENS AND DOZENS OF MORE
SO I'M JUST GIVING YOU A 30000 FEET VIEW
YOU HAVE TO PUT THESE THREE ELEMENTS TOGETHER
AND THAT IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY
THIS IS A FUEL INJECTION NOZZLE FOR THE NEW GENERATION OF GE JET ENGINES
10 OF EVERYTHING IS 1
PEOPLE LIKE YOU
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN USED AS A PROTOTYPING TOOL BUT IT'S A LOT MORE THAN THAT
THEY HAD TO TAKE THE PART BACK TO AMERICA THEY HAD TO REVERSE ENGINEER IT AND THEN INSTALL IT
IT'S THE PLANE CRASH IN NIGERIA WHEN I LIVED THERE IN 2012
IF WE'RE SENDING A DIGITAL DESIGN ACROSS BORDERS WILL TAX IT THE SAME WAY
THAT SUMMER WE HAD A NURSE WHO HAD BEEN SICK FOR A WHILE
THE NEXT MORNING I WALKED IN TO CHECK ON MY PATIENT
I MEASURED MY BODY TEMPERATURE SEVERAL TIMES
ABOUT EIGHT YEARS AGO WE AS A FAMILY MET WITH AN ACCIDENT WHILE AT BIG BEAR LAKE IN CALIFORNIA
IN PRE EXISTENCE OF THE MATHEMATICAL BIOCHEMICAL EQUATIONS THE MANIFESTATIONS OF ROCK PLANT AIR FIRE
DJING MCING BREAK DANCING GRAFFITI ART AND THE FIFTH ELEMENT WHICH IS THE ONE I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TODAY
YOU'RE HISTORY JUST LIKE HENRY IV
I'M THE WORST WITH THE WORDS CAUSE I CURSE ALL MY VERBS
NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY IT WILL NEVER WORK
YOU'RE MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING ALL YOU DO IS BITE IT
OF COURSE I'M THE ONE WITH THE FORCE
AND WHAT WAS IT ABOUT
WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT
IT'S MORE THAN THAT
IT'S BECOMING AN ELECTRIC APPLIANCE
AND THAT WILL NEVER GROW
THAT'S WHAT I CALL DISRUPTION
IT'S NOT JUST AN ELECTRIC CAR
AND I SAY WELL YEAH BUT IT'S HEAVILY SUBSIDIZED
THAT'S HIGHLY DISRUPTIVE
THAT'S WHY YOU WANT IT
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT TODAY
THEY WILL CHARGE FASTER
IN 1 OR 2 YEARS YOU GOT A SERIOUS MARKET SHARE
YEAR ON YEAR THESE PRODUCTS GET BETTER AND BETTER AND BETTER
WELL THAT'S GONNA CHANGE
IT DOESN'T DRIVE ELECTRIC
HE SAYS YEAH THIS CAR IT JUST ACCELERATES LIKE HELL
AND I CAN DOWNLOAD APPS ON IT
AND I CAN SURF THE WEB
I KNEW VERY LITTLE OF THEM AS PEOPLE
HER HAIR WAS TANGLED BLACK AND WILD
SO THEY SAID WHY NOT TAKE REGULAR BACTERIA TO PUT INSIDE SOME GENES WHICH WILL ALLOW IT
INTO A BETTER FUTURE IN WHICH WE COULD MAYBE ERADICATE DISEASES SUCH AS CANCER
SCHWARZ IN THE WEIZMANN INSTITUTE SEARCHING FOR SOME KIND OF CURE
I CAN TAKE FROM SOMEONE S FECES HIS OWN BACTERIA TO INSTALL ONTO THE BACTERIA SOME SOFTWARE
OR MAYBE EVEN CURE POLIO
EACH TYPE OF BACTERIA GLOWS IN A DIFFERENT COLOR AND GETS A COMMAND TO DIVIDE AND FLOURISH UNDER A DIFFERENT
OUR SKIN CELLS ARE SO SMART THAT THEY CAN SENSE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN MUTATED TO THE POINT IN WHICH SKIN
SO THEY PREFER TO COMMIT SUICIDE
AND THUS TO ELIMINATE THE VERY SEVERE AND SOMETIMES DEADLY SIDE EFFECTS CAUSED BY TREATMENTS NOWADAYS
WE ALL MOVE IN THIS KIND OF BOUNCY WAY WHEN WE RUN
AND WE'VE MADE SOME ADVANCES SO FAR BUT THERE'S STILL A LONG WAY TO GO AND HOPEFULLY SOME OF YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE TO
THEN SAM WEISS AND BRENT REYNOLDS DISCOVERED THAT WE ALL HAVE STEM CELLS IN OUR
I THINK PERHAPS AS AN ENGINEER WE ARE NOT BURDENED BY SOME OF THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM OR DOGMA
WE HAD INVENTED A NEW BIOMATERIAL A WATER SWOLLEN MATERIAL CALLED HYDROGEL
USUALLY THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER IS FANTASTIC BECAUSE IT PROTECTS OUR BRAINS FROM EVERYDAY
WHEN WE MIXED PHOTORECEPTOR CELLS INTO OUR INJECTABLE HYDROGEL AND
AFTER THAT WE PUT POISONS INTO OUR BODIES TO TRY TO KILL THE RAPIDLY DIVIDING CELLS
WE WOULD REPLACE THE VERY CELLS THAT ARE LOST IN BLINDNESS THAT IS THE PHOTORECEPTOR
IF WE WERE GOING TO BE ABLE TO OVERCOME BLINDNESS WE NEEDED TO FIND A WAY
THE AMERICAN INVENTION IS THE CROSSWORD PUZZLE AND THIS YEAR WE ARE CELEBRATING THE 100TH
THAT SENT ME TO AN X RAY THEN TO AN MRI
PEOPLE WERE INCREDIBLY DRAWN
I BROKE MY LEFT FEMUR THAT DAY IT'S THE LARGEST BONE IN YOUR BODY AND SPENT THE NEXT TWO MONTHS IN A BODY
MAY YOU FIND A MUD PUDDLE TO JUMP IN SOMEPLACE OR FIND A WAY TO GET OVER AROUND OR THROUGH ANY WALL THAT STANDS BETWEEN
I WOULD REACH OUT TO SIX MEN FROM ALL PARTS OF MY LIFE AND ASK THEM TO BE PRESENT IN THE PASSAGES OF MY
AND WE WENT TO THIS APPLE ORCHARD AND I READ HIM THIS LETTER
SO WHAT HAPPENED WAS I WROTE A LETTER TO EACH OF THESE MEN
WE KIND OF WENT THROUGH MY PERSONALITY AND TRIED TO GET A DAD WHO REPRESENTED EACH DIFFERENT THING
AND WHAT WAS SO STRIKING ABOUT THAT TIME WAS INSTEAD OF REPULSING PEOPLE I WAS ACTUALLY PROVING TO BE A MAGNET
INSTEAD IT WAS EVERYBODY RUNNING THE OTHER WAY
EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT ARE UNDER 21
SO A FEW WEEKS AFTER MY DIAGNOSIS WE WENT UP TO VERMONT AND I DECIDED TO PUT JEFF AS THE FIRST PERSON IN THE
I SAID LOOK IN GEORGIA AT LEAST WE WANT TO KNOW
THAT'S WHY THEY WERE CALLED APE HANGERS
I WAS AT A WALL
AND MY DOCTOR ON A WHIM SENT ME TO GET A FULL BODY BONE SCAN WHICH SHOWED THAT THERE WAS SOME GROWTH IN MY LEFT LEG
AND THAT WAS WHAT'S THE ONE PIECE OF ADVICE YOU WOULD GIVE TO MY GIRLS
I WAS HIT BY A PASSING SEDAN
I'M BRUCE I SAID AND PROMPTLY PASSED OUT
BUT WHEN I CAME TO SEE YOU I SAID I DIDN'T BELIEVE IN MYSELF
THERE ARE MANY HEALTH ISSUES AS WELL
AND FOR DONOR AGENCIES UNFORTUNATELY THE AUDIENCE TENDS TO BE PEOPLE THAT AREN'T EVEN IN THE COUNTRY
IN THE PAST 10 YEARS FIVE MILLION PEOPLE HAVE DIED DUE TO A WAR IN THE EAST
THEY LIKE THE GENERICS
AND SO I STARTED TO LOOK AT WHAT THE MARKETING LOOKED LIKE
THEIR MARKETING IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT
IT WAS A PRETTY TAME UNCONTROVERSIAL VIDEO OR SO
IN JEWISH CULTURE IT'S THE SHEMIRA' RESPECTFULLY GUARDING THE DEAD FROM THE TIME OF DEATH UNTIL THEY'RE
THE SECOND IS THAT FAMILIES ARE NOT ALLOWED TO BE INVOLVED THAT A FUNERAL DIRECTOR HAS TO
IN FACT WHAT HUMANS HAVE BEEN DOING FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS
YOU'D BE CRAZY TO PLAY WITH A DEAD PERSON LIKE A DOLL
THAT'S NOT TRUE EITHER
MY POSITION THERE WAS GOING TO BE NOT ONLY CREMATING THE DEAD BUT ALSO PREPARING THE
YOU GOT YOUR GRANDPA'S CORPSE IN YOUR HOUSE
IN THE WEST WE HAVE NEVER HAD QUITE THIS CLOSE A RELATIONSHIP WITH DEATH AND I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT
THE BASIC STORY HERE IS THAT WHAT USED TO BE VERTICALLY INTEGRATED OLIGOPOLISTIC
AND IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION IF WE LOOK SAY AT THE ENERGY SECTOR WHERE ALL THE TALK IS ABOUT HOW
AND WE NEED INDUSTRY STRUCTURES THAT WILL ACCOMMODATE VERY VERY DIFFERENT MOTIVATIONS FROM THE AMATEUR
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE SATELLITES
AND WHEN WE HAVE SATELLITES WE'LL HAVE SATELLITES FOR EDUCATION FOR ENTERTAINMENT
I SHOULD PUT THESE PROGRAMS UP ON SATELLITE AND SEND THEM OVER THE UNITED STATES
THAT MEANS THEY'RE TOTALLY OUT OF SYNC IN TRADITIONAL CLASSES WHICH ARE ANALOG STATIC INTERACTIVELY PASSIVE
THE OLD SHYNESS WAS A FEAR OF REJECTION
IT'S A SOCIAL AWKWARDNESS LIKE YOU'RE A STRANGER IN A FOREIGN LAND
DRUGS YOU WANT MORE OF THE SAME DIFFERENT
WHAT I FIND FASCINATING IS THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY WIRED OUR WORLD TO SHARE WHETHER THAT'S OUR
I CALL THIS GROUNDSWELL COLLABORATIVE CONSUMPTION
SMITH A WOULD BE GROWER
YOU GET TO TELL THE STORY ON BLAKE'S BEHALF ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE WHO GOT THE SHOES
THEY HAVE CURIOSITY
THEY COMMIT TO THE TRIBE
CURIOSITY ABOUT PEOPLE IN THE TRIBE CURIOSITY ABOUT OUTSIDERS
BUT YOU DON'T NEED EVERYONE
THAT WE TRY TO FIND A PIECE OF THE STATUS QUO SOMETHING THAT BOTHERS US SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED SOMETHING THAT IS
AND I WANT TO SHARE A COUPLE STORIES WITH YOU TODAY
AND THEN HE WENT TO NORTH CAROLINA AND DID IT AGAIN
THEY GET TO LEAD
THEY ARE INTERDEPENDENT CO DEPENDENT WITH THE ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE
NOW THE QUESTION IS
HAS ANYONE EVER NOTICED THAT IN THEIR OWN LIVES
WE AT CHAN ZUCKERBERG CAN DO SOME THINGS
IT CHANGED THE POSSIBILITIES REALLY IMPORTANT
IT IS NOT A DIFFERENT THING THAN THE WORK OF SCHOOL IT IS THE WORK OF SCHOOL AS MUCH AS TEACHING MATH READING AND SCIENCE
IT CAN HAPPEN OUTSIDE SCHOOL JUST AS WELL
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHAT IT'S CALLED
IS MY STORY
AND I LOVE D
IMAGINE WHAT THEY COULD DO
AND THAT HAS TO DO AS WELL WITH POLITENESS
TO EVERY SINGLE EVENT THAT THE VERY GOOD FRIEND WILL DO
HOW EASY IT IS TO BELIEVE THAT THE PERSON HAS MOVED AWAY BECAUSE YOU'RE OF A DIFFERENT SKIN
WHAT WILL HAPPEN THERE IS THAT THE SOUTH AMERICAN WILL BE VERY EAGER AND WILL STAND AT A DISTANCE THAT'S COMFORTABLE FOR HIM
BY PREVENTING THEM FROM THEIR OPPRESSION
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THEM
HOW DID THEY GET ME TO DO THAT
AND ONE WAS CALLED BALLET SLIPPERS
AND I BROUGHT WOMEN INTO THE LABORATORY AND I ASKED THEM WHICH ONE WOULD YOU PICK
AND THE OTHER ONE WAS CALLED ADORABLE
IT REQUIRES THAT EVERYONE TREAT CHOICE AS A PRIVATE AND SELF DEFINING
I'M AWARE OF THIS CUSTOM
COM WITH WHAT IS IT
THESE ARE THE FUTURE ANTHROPOMETRICS
SO WE COMBINED THESE NEEDS WITH TECHNOLOGY'S THEMES
THIS WILL BE VERY DIFFERENT IN THE FUTURE
AND SO WE GOT UNDERWAY ON THAT AND THEN I'M SITTING ON MY COUCH IN 2008
IF THE WORKER IN STATION 3 DECIDES TO LEAVE AND GO TO THE BATHROOM IT HAS NO IMPACT ON THE PRODUCTIVITY OF
DID YOU EVER STOP TO THINK ABOUT HOW THOSE ITEMS OF INVENTORY ACTUALLY FOUND THEIR WAY INSIDE THAT BOX IN THE
AND SAY LABOR IS CHEAP LAND IS CHEAP
WE'LL PUT THEM ON MOBILE SHELVING
THE MEDIA LANDSCAPE IN THE 20TH CENTURY WAS VERY GOOD AT HELPING PEOPLE CONSUME AND WE GOT AS A
IT IS ONE OF THE CURIOSITIES OF OUR HISTORICAL ERA THAT EVEN AS COGNITIVE SURPLUS IS
SHE WOULD POST THEM
SO I CAME UP WITH A PLAN
FIRST OFF MY TEACHER DIDN'T SCOLD ME SHE WAS KIND
HE FIGURED THIS WAS JUST SOME GUY HAVING A REALLY BAD DAY AND THEY COULD BOTH BENEFIT
WELL THIS MAN IN THE CAR BEHIND HIM WAS SO TOUCHED THAT HE BOUGHT THE COFFEE FOR THE PERSON BEHIND HIM
AND IT'S NOT JUST THE RECIPIENT WHO BENEFITS
AND I WAS SETTING UP WHAT I THOUGHT WAS THE LAST DISMAL SHOT OF A DISMAL DAY
I SAID YEAH I GOT ONE
THERE S MORE THAN ONE RIGHT ANSWER
THEY ALL WANT TO TRY IT ON
SO WE WENT DOWN INTO THE WOODS AND I GOT MY FIRST SHOT
THERE ARE A THOUSAND WAYS TO COME AT ANY CHALLENGE TO FIND THAT EXTRAORDINARY VIEW
I'D GET A FLASHLIGHT
AND THAT'S THE STORY I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU TONIGHT
MY WIN IS YOUR LOSS
AND SO I AM TURNING TO MY MOM WHO IS SITTING RIGHT HERE NEXT TO ME OF COURSE SHE DIDN'T
AND I AM GOING TO TELL YOU THIS ONE THING FROM A SLIGHTLY OUTSIDE PERSPECTIVE AS I'VE MENTIONED TO YOU I AM SWISS FRENCH THOUGH I'VE
SINCE THAT DAY I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT I WAS RAISED WITHOUT KNOWING IT AS A POP CULTURE
YOU SEE I FOUND A WAY TO TURN THIS PASSION OF MINE INTO A CAREER
AND SO WE'LL SEE A GRUMPY CAT MOVIE IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS
I DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME TO BE DOING A LOT OF THE PROMOTIONS THAT I WANTED TO BE DOING
I'M A BIG SPORTS FAN AND I GOT TO DO THE HALFTIME SHOWS AT SOME FOOTBALL GAMES AND MY LOCAL ICE HOCKEY GAME
SHORTLY AFTER THAT MY GRANDFATHER DIED OF PROSTATE CANCER AND WITHIN ABOUT SIX MONTHS
I WAS TOLD TO SHARE MY VOICE WHENEVER POSSIBLE
WHY COULD THEY SHARE THEIR IDEAS SO EASILY AND I COULDN'T EVEN COME UP WITH A TOPIC
WHEN WE DON'T UNDERSTAND SOMETHING WE TEND TO BE AFRAID OF IT AND IF WE KEEP OURSELVES FROM IT THAT
AND THEN I BECAME TERRIFIED TO LEARN THAT THEY'D ACTUALLY BE PUTTING ME BACK AT MY OLD HIGH SCHOOL
BUT I DECIDED I HAD TO DO SOMETHING
WHY THE HELL WOULD I WANT TO DO THAT
IN WHAT OTHER PARTS OF OUR LIVES PERHAPS THAT WE CARE MORE ABOUT ARE WE WORKING HARD BUT NOT IMPROVING
A TIGHTROPE WALKER DOESN'T PRACTICE NEW TRICKS WITHOUT A NET UNDERNEATH AND AN ATHLETE WOULDN'T SET OUT TO FIRST TRY A NEW MOVE
THIS HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE TRUE IN TEACHING GENERAL MEDICINE NURSING AND OTHER FIELDS AND IT HAPPENS BECAUSE
IT CAN ALSO BE MOTIVATING AND IT PROVIDES US WITH INFORMATION TO IDENTIFY WHAT TO FOCUS ON NEXT WHEN WE GO BACK TO THE
FOR EXAMPLE WE MIGHT FIND A MENTOR OR A TRUSTED COLLEAGUE WITH WHOM WE CAN EXCHANGE IDEAS OR HAVE VULNERABLE
THEY READ TO EXTEND THEIR KNOWLEDGE CONSULT WITH COLLEAGUES OR DOMAIN EXPERTS TRY OUT NEW STRATEGIES SOLICIT
OF COURSE HE STUDIED A LOT
HE STUDIED LAW AND PHILOSOPHY WITH GUIDANCE FROM MENTORS BUT HE ALSO REALIZED THAT BEING A LAWYER
IT IS THIS TYPE OF PRACTICE IN THE LEARNING ZONE WHICH LEADS TO SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT NOT JUST TIME ON
THEY SAID YES BUT WE DON'T KNOW HOW
ONE BILLION PEOPLE LACK ACCESS TO CLEAN DRINKING WATER
THE WOMEN WHO WERE ABLE TO WORK WITH LEATHER WORKED WITH LEATHER THE ONES WHO WERE WORKING WITH WOOL WERE WORKING WITH WOOL
WHEN I HEARD ABOUT THIS I WENT WITH THE INTERNS OF MY COMPANY TO THIS VILLAGE AND WE REALIZED THAT MANY
THE BEST WAS TO BECOME ONE OF THOSE 2
6 BILLION PEOPLE MYSELF
IT WAS A QUITE LONESOME TIME BECAUSE PEOPLE STOPPED VISITING ME MY GIRLFRIEND EVEN REFUSED TO COME FROM RIGA TO
THEY DON'T FORGET COMPLETELY
IF THERE'S A CRISIS THEY JUST HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO DO
EVERYTHING FROM DROWNING TO CAR CRASH
THERE WILL BE SCREAMING
IF YOU LOSE THEN THE VICTIM DIES YOU GO BACK A BIT YOU TRY AGAIN
WE NATURALLY WANT TO DO LIFESAVER FOR GERMANY FOR THE UNITED STATES FOR CHINA
AND WE THROW YOU RIGHT IN AT THE DEEP END
OKAY NOW LIFESAVER IS AN IDEA
BUT THEY FORGET TO THE EXTENT THAT IF A CRISIS REALLY HAPPENS THEY DON'T ACTUALLY
BECAUSE IT'S SO DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THEY'VE SEEN BEFORE THAT THEY JUST CAN'T HELP
IT WILL NOT BE AT ALL NICE OR POLITE
THERE WILL BE PANIC
AND SO THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING
AND SO THE WHOLE THING JUST COLLAPSES HORRIBLY
MUCH MORE GRIPPING
AND SO OF COURSE THEY CAN'T HELP
THERE WILL BE SHOUTING
THERE WILL BE BLOOD
AND SO IT BECOMES MUCH MORE EMOTIONALLY INVOLVING
WE ALSO WANT TO DO 12 MOST COMMON EMERGENCIES
SO LET'S LOOK AT THE FIRST CHOICE THAT YOU COME ACROSS IN THE FIRST FILM
AND WE WENT TO EVERYONE WE COULD THINK OF
WE WENT TO TINY CHARITIES LIKE THE RESUSCITATION COUNCIL UK
IT WAS THAT CLOSE
WE WANT TO DO ONE ABOUT WOMEN'S PERSONAL SAFETY
SCIENCE FICTION IS NOT SO FAR FROM BECOMING SCIENCE FACT
SECOND WE WANT TO SUPPORT YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE BEGINNING THEIR CAREERS AND ARE INTERESTED IN THE
ORG AND SIGN UP
WHAT WILL BE YOUR ROLE
HE WENT BACK
I HAD FIGHTS WITH THEM
YOU CAN DEVELOP THIS
NICE FOR HIM TO SAY IT BUT I CAN'T DO THAT
AND HE'S FREAKED OUT
SO MY MOTHER IN THIS LIFE IS REALLY GREAT
SO THAT ENCOURAGED HIM AND HE WENT WITH MAITREYA
SO HE SAID ALL RIGHT
AND THEN THE FOURTH STEP YOU GO TO WHAT IS CALLED LOVELY LOVE
AND SO AGAIN HE GOES BACK
BROTHERS CAN FIGHT
AND I SHOULD DO SOMETHING
AND MAITREYA THEN KEPT HIM IN HEAVEN FOR FIVE YEARS DICTATING TO HIM FIVE COMPLICATED
THEY COULD ALL BE JUST FINE
AND WE SEE THE MOTHER IN EVERY BEING
YOU WILL EVEN WEEP PERHAPS WITH GRATITUDE AND KINDNESS
AND YOU LOOK AT THEM AND YOU SEE HOW THEY ARE
SOMETIMES THEY WERE UNFRIENDLY
AND MAITREYA SAYS I WAS WITH YOU
AND THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT THE CHARTER OF COMPASSION MUST LEAD US TO DEVELOP THROUGH TRUE COMPASSION
NOBODY SEEMS ALIEN
WHEN THEY'RE ANGRY THEY LOOK UGLY EVERY BEING BUT WHEN THEY'RE HAPPY THEY LOOK BEAUTIFUL
I GET THE POINT
SO BUDDHA'S TEACHING HAS LOST ITS MOMENTUM
AND HE BECAME INTERESTED IN THAT
THERE IS NO WAY NOT TO DO IT
HE WENT BACK TO HIS CAVE
THEY WOULD BE RELAXING SOMEWHERE HAVING A GOOD TIME
SO NATURALLY THEY CHASED HIM OUT OF TOWN
I SAID THAT WOULD BE GREAT BECAUSE I DID THIS 25 YEARS AGO
IT SHOULD BE SO EXCITING TO BE OUT IN THE WORLD TO BE FREE
TAKE A MOMENT AND THINK ABOUT OUR GOOD FRIEND DOROTHY FROM THE WIZARD OF OZ
NEARLY ALL OF THEM SAID NO NO WE HAVEN'T
THE DEMAND IS ALREADY THERE RIGHT
DID YOU THINK YOU WERE GOING TO BE IN AN ACCIDENT
OF COURSE NOT
WE TAKE THIS FROM THE TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOFTWARE WORLD
WE BUILD ULTRA EFFICIENT CARS
THESE AGAIN INCREASE OUR VELOCITY AND WE FOUND THAT MORALE IS A MULTIPLIER FOR VELOCITY
YOU'LL SHARPEN YOUR AGILE SKILLS AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD AROUND YOU
THIS LETS US MAKE CHANGES AND DEVELOP QUICKLY
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE WHEN EXISTING CARS SEEM TO CHANGE SO SLOWLY
SO WHAT'S WIKISPEED DOING NEXT
AND IF YOU ARE A PROCESS COACH OR A SCRUM MASTER
IF YOU OWN A BUSINESS IDENTIFY A MEMBER OF YOUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO BE A PROCESS COACH FOR THE
WE ARE MORE THAN 100 VOLUNTEERS IN EIGHT COUNTRIES NOW
MANY OF THE MEMBERS OF TEAM WIKISPEED SPENT BETWEEN TWO AND EIGHT HOUR A WEEK HELPING US RAPIDLY DEVELOP OUR
IF EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM SPENT EVEN JUST TWO HOURS A WEEK RAPIDLY SOLVING PROBLEMS FOR SOCIAL
THIS AVOIDS TIME SPENT TRAINING THAT'S NOT PRODUCTIVE
SO WHAT TO DO
WE ARE SAFE BECAUSE WE DESIGN SAFETY TESTS FOR OUR PARTS BEFORE WE EVEN BUILD THEM
I AM JOE JUSTICE
WE TIED FOR 10TH IN THE MAINSTREAM CLASS
THAT MEANT THAT WE OUTLASTED MORE THAN 100 OTHER CARS FROM COMPANIES AND UNIVERSITIES
I NOTICED A TREND
AND THEN HOW CAN YOU MARKET THIS APP TO THAT AUDIENCE
ALL THESE PEOPLE RECOGNIZED THAT
I'D LIKE TO CONTRIBUTE
THAT WE ARE SELFISH
AND JULIO SAYS I'M ABOUT TO GO TO HAVE DINNER
WHAT WAS THE FORCE
WHAT WOULD EMERGE IF WE TURN THIS QUESTION ON ITS HEAD
AND THESE GUYS ACTUALLY DO A LOT OF AMAZING INTERESTING STUFF
IS THIS A FUNDRAISER
HOW MUCH WOULD YOU PAY
THEY START TO CONNECT THEY START TO BOND
AND I THINK GANDHI TACKLES THIS SPOT ON IN ONE SENTENCE THERE IS ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE'S NEED
SO WE TOLD ALL OUR FRIENDS ABOUT IT
SO THEY DECIDE TO DO AN EXPERIMENT
AND THE MARKER OF GIFTIVISM IS THAT IS FOR THE 100
LET'S NOT FUNDRAISE
WHAT THAT MEANT WAS THAT INSTEAD OF SHOWING VALUE WE WOULD JUST FOCUS ON ADDING VALUE
HE ENDED UP WALKING 70000 KILOMETERS
WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL I WAS SO PASSIONATE IN ART AND DESIGN THAT EVERY TIME MY TEACHER TURNED HER
THIS IS A PICTURE OF THE COMPLEX THAT CONTROLS THE MOVEMENT OF THE CELL
I TRULY BELIEVE THIS
AND I WANT TO FOCUS ON MATHEMATICS
LET'S PLAY AROUND WITH THE EARTH
BUT THIS IS FOUR THIRDS
OK SO WHY AM I DOING ALL THIS
WE FIND PATTERNS AND WE REPRESENT THEM
MY CLAIM IS THAT UNDERSTANDING HAS TO DO WITH THE ABILITY TO CHANGE YOUR PERSPECTIVE
I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT HOW AMAZING REPRESENTING SOMETHING ACTUALLY IS
SO THAT IS MY CLAIM
HUMAN BEINGS HAVE THE ABILITY TO ACCUMULATE DATA PRESERVE IT WRITE IT DOWN AND
USE EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT
I WAS TELLING A STORY TO MYSELF BECAUSE I WANTED TO BELIEVE IN IT
I WANTED MOSES TO KNOW
BECAUSE HE IS A HUMAN BEING
EVEN FOR A BIG CUT ON YOUR ARM
AND THERE ARE CONSIDERATIONS BESIDES COST
A SKILLED NURSE PRACTITIONER CAN REPLACE A FEEDING TUBE THAT CAME OUT OR STOPPED WORKING
HE PICKED UP A GI ILLNESS AND HAD PRETTY SIGNIFICANT VOMITING AND DIARRHEA
THIS HOSPITAL BASED SYSTEM USES ROBUST EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES TO HELP PATIENTS THAT MIGHT BE SERIOUSLY
BECAUSE THE ER HAS TO BE FULLY PREPARED WITH SPECIALISTS TRAINING MEDICATIONS AND EQUIPMENT FOR
AND THE COST FOR INDIVIDUALS IS HIGH AS WELL
SOMETHING THAT I KNOW VERY WELL THESE PRINCIPLES
THAT MEANS ABOUT 190 MILES PER HOUR
SO NEW THINGS
SO IT'S REALLY A PLAY BETWEEN THESE TWO APPROACHES
BUT HE IS ALSO A BRILLIANT REPORTER
THEY WENT UPSTAIRS AND THEY BEGAN TALKING
IN OTHER WORDS THERE'S A COMPLETE RECORD OF WHERE YOU'VE BEEN
I THINK WE SHOULD THANK EDWARD SNOWDEN
REALLY IT WAS KIND OF A BADLY WRITTEN KGB DRAMA
IF YOU GO TO YOUR PRIVACY SETTINGS YOU CAN FIND OUT IT'S ALL BEING COLLECTED
AND THE THREE OF THEM FLEW TO HONG KONG
BASICALLY EVENTS OF THE BEGINNING OF LAST YEAR WENT INTO FAST FORWARD BY THE SPRING OF LAST YEAR SNOWDEN WAS READY TO DO THIS LEAK
HE DIDN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT
AND SNOWDEN CAME UP WITH A SUGGESTION WHICH WAS AND I KID YOU NOT
THEY MET WITH SNOWDEN AT THE MIRA HOTEL INITIALLY GLENN AND LAURA
I HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE
NOW THIS WAS A HUGE DEAL RIGHT
SO I STARTED BY BLAMING EVERYBODY
THIS MINDSET IS WHAT I'M PERSONALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT
BUT HISTORIANS DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED
WE WANT THEM TO WIN
THIS SHAPES HOW WE THINK ABOUT OUR HEALTH OUR RELATIONSHIPS HOW WE DECIDE HOW TO VOTE WHAT
AND ON THAT FATEFUL DAY I SCARFED DOWN WITH TEARS MY LAST PINT OF CHOCOLATE H AGEN DAZS
BUT LET'S LOOK AT THE WORLDWIDE TRENDS
ONE IS CERTAINLY TO PROVIDE NUTRITIONAL GUIDELINES BUT ANOTHER ONE IS TO SUPPORT AGRIBUSINESS
I WAS RAISED IN A STORY WHERE CAUTION WAS USELESS LB AMP TL
EVERY TWO MINUTES AN AMERICAN IS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED
AND THAT'S A LOT OF THE REASON WHY WE CARE SO MUCH ABOUT OUR CAREERS AND INDEED START CARING SO MUCH ABOUT
THE PROBLEM OF MODERN SOCIETY IS IT TURNS THE WHOLE WORLD INTO A SCHOOL
WHEN WE THINK ABOUT FAILING IN LIFE WHEN WE THINK ABOUT FAILURE ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE FEAR FAILING IS NOT JUST A LOSS OF
AND SOME OF THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT PEOPLE TAKE WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM EXTREMELY PERSONALLY THEY OWN THEIR SUCCESS BUT THEY
I DON'T THINK WE ARE PARTICULARLY MATERIALISTIC
AUGUSTINE IN THE CITY OF GOD WHERE HE SAYS IT'S A SIN TO JUDGE ANY MAN BY HIS POST
AND THEY ARE DESCRIBED AS LOSERS
YOU CAN'T HAVE IT ALL
THERE IS ANOTHER REASON WHY WE MIGHT BE FEELING MORE ANXIOUS ABOUT OUR CAREERS ABOUT OUR STATUS IN THE WORLD TODAY
NOT FOR THE SAKE OF OUR HEALTH THOUGH IT'S OFTEN PRESENTED THAT WAY BUT BECAUSE IT'S AN ESCAPE FROM THE HUMAN ANTHILL
THEY CAME UP WITH LOVE CRAZED IMMIGRANT KILLS SENATOR'S DAUGHTER
NOWADAYS PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED STATES IF YOU MEET SOMEONE AT THE BOTTOM OF SOCIETY THEY MAY UNKINDLY BE DESCRIBED AS A
NO ONE'S QUITE LISTENING HARD ENOUGH BUT I VERY MUCH BELIEVE IT'S TRUE
THE DOMINANT KIND OF SNOBBERY THAT EXISTS NOWADAYS IS JOB SNOBBERY
AND THAT MAKES FAILURE SEEM MUCH MORE CRUSHING
IT'S PERHAPS EASIER NOW THAN EVER BEFORE TO MAKE A GOOD LIVING
AND YET THEY'RE NOT
LET ME EXPLAIN
IN OTHER WORDS THEY HAVE FAILED
ENVY IT'S A REAL TABOO TO MENTION ENVY BUT IF THERE'S ONE DOMINANT EMOTION IN MODERN SOCIETY THAT IS ENVY
BUT LET'S ACCEPT THE STRANGENESS OF SOME OF OUR IDEAS
IT'S AN ESCAPE FROM OUR OWN COMPETITION AND OUR OWN DRAMAS
YOU CAN MAKE IT
AND IT'S AGAIN LINKED TO SOMETHING NICE
THEY'VE SLEPT WITH THE WRONG PERSON TAKEN THE WRONG SUBSTANCE PASSED THE WRONG PIECE OF LEGISLATION WHATEVER IT IS AND THEN ARE FIT
AND SO WE TEND TO WORSHIP OURSELVES
IN OTHER WORDS YOUR POSITION IN LIFE COMES TO SEEM NOT ACCIDENTAL BUT MERITED AND DESERVED
THERE ARE SIMPLY TOO MANY RANDOM FACTORS ACCIDENTS ACCIDENTS OF BIRTH ACCIDENTS OF THINGS DROPPING ON PEOPLE'S HEADS
AUGUSTINE ONLY GOD CAN REALLY PUT EVERYBODY IN THEIR PLACE HE'S GOING TO DO THAT ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT WITH ANGELS AND
NOW IS THERE ANY ALTERNATIVE TO THIS
IN OTHER WORDS HOLD YOUR HORSES WHEN YOU'RE COMING TO JUDGE PEOPLE
EVERYBODY'S WEARING JEANS EVERYBODY'S THE SAME
IT'S NOT THE POST THAT SHOULD COUNT
MOST OTHER SOCIETIES HAVE HAD RIGHT AT THEIR CENTER THE WORSHIP OF SOMETHING TRANSCENDENT A GOD A SPIRIT A NATURAL FORCE
THERE ARE OTHER REASONS WHY IT'S PERHAPS HARDER NOW TO FEEL CALM THAN EVER BEFORE
AND IT'S A BEAUTIFUL IDEA
WE HEAR A LOT OF TALK ABOUT WORK LIFE BALANCE
IF YOU OPEN THE NEWSPAPER ANY DAY OF THE WEEK IT'S FULL OF PEOPLE WHO'VE MESSED UP THEIR LIVES
THE PROBLEM IS IF YOU REALLY BELIEVE IN A SOCIETY WHERE THOSE WHO MERIT TO GET TO THE TOP GET TO THE TOP
THAT'S EXHILARATING IF YOU'RE DOING WELL AND VERY CRUSHING IF YOU'RE NOT
SO I'M GOING TO END IT THERE
AT THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM YOU'VE GOT TRAGEDY AND TRAGIC ART
MOST PEOPLE MAKE A STRICT CORRELATION BETWEEN HOW MUCH TIME AND IF YOU LIKE LOVE NOT ROMANTIC LOVE THOUGH THAT MAY BE
WE NEED FATHERS AS IT WERE THE EXEMPLARY FATHER FIGURES IN SOCIETY AVOIDING THE TWO EXTREMES
SNOBBERY IS A GLOBAL PHENOMENON WE ARE A GLOBAL ORGANIZATION THIS IS A GLOBAL PHENOMENON
WHAT IS A SNOB
BUT WHAT I REALLY WANT TO STRESS IS BY ALL MEANS SUCCESS YES
HE IS NOT A LOSER THOUGH HE HAS LOST
WE'VE SLIGHTLY LOST THE HABIT OF DOING THAT WHICH IS I THINK WHY WE'RE PARTICULARLY DRAWN TO NATURE
YOU DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW WHAT SOMEONE'S TRUE VALUE IS
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL IDEA
RIGHT IT'S GONE
OR IS IT STILL UP THERE
THERE ARE PLENTY OF DOWNSIDES
YOU'VE HAD TO WRESTLE WITH ISSUES LIKE CHILD PORNOGRAPHY
CA AND THAT CONTENT IS ALL OFF THE BOARD NOW
I DON'T KNOW WHY
THAT IS WHAT I AM TRYING TO SAY
AS LIKE THREE OR FOUR DIFFERENT PEOPLE
IT'S JUST I COULDN'T LIKE I COULDN'T PROCESS
THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH A WOMAN OF SIZE
NO I AM TEASING ABOUT THAT
SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT'S THE MOST POPULAR DIET
I MEAN REALLY FAST
IT WAS REALLY TOO MUCH
NO OFFENSE TO THEM
MY NAME IS NEREIDA
IT'S LIKE THE SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE
I AM ALSO A BLOGGER
SORT OF AND NOT REALLY
AND THESE OBJECTS ARE VISUALLY IDENTICAL BUT WHEN THE AVATAR CROSSES THE SURFACE OF THESE
AND THE FEEDBACK THAT COMES FROM THE AVATAR IS BEING PROCESSED DIRECTLY BY THE BRAIN WITHOUT THE INTERFERENCE OF THE
SO I WAS TOLD ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO THAT THIS WOULD NEVER HAPPEN
THAT'S THE WAY IT IS
A COUPLE IN THE BACK
WHAT ARE THEY
THAT KIND OF THING
AND THAT IS THE MAIN REASON I NOTED
EVERYBODY SAYS THAT
YOU WON'T BELIEVE IT BUT THERE ARE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE MOST ATTRACTIVE PLACE TO BE IS NOT THE SHOPPING CENTER BUT THE
YOU KNOW POLAND HASN'T CHANGED ITS CULTURE
HOW DO THE MEDIA TALK ABOUT SCHOOLS AND TEACHERS
IF WE CAN HELP EVERY CHILD EVERY TEACHER EVERY SCHOOL EVERY PRINCIPAL EVERY
EVERY STUDENT KNOWS WHAT MATTERS
AND THE MOST IMPRESSIVE OUTCOMES OF WORLD CLASS SYSTEMS IS THAT THEY ACHIEVE HIGH PERFORMANCE ACROSS THE ENTIRE SYSTEM
IT CHANGED ITS EDUCATION POLICIES AND PRACTICE
THIS IS THE BLUE BAR WHICH IS DRIVING COSTS DOWN
PEOPLE WERE STUNNED BY THE RESULTS
THEY DON'T WANT TO BEFRIEND ONE ANOTHER
AND REMEMBER THAT IN THESE MOVIES IT'S USUALLY WORST IN THE SECOND ACT WHEN OUR LEADS ARE
THEY DON'T WANT TO DATE ONE ANOTHER
WELL THESE WERE EXACTLY THE QUESTIONS THAT I AND MY COLLEAGUE MATT FEINBERG BECAME FASCINATED WITH A FEW YEARS AGO
59 PERCENT OF THEM MADE ARGUMENTS IN TERMS OF ONE OF THE MORE CONSERVATIVE MORAL VALUES AND JUST EIGHT PERCENT
WE USED LANDMARKS TO APPROXIMATE THEIR PHYSICAL ADDRESSES
YOU MADE THE RIGHT CALL I'M LISTENING VERY CAREFULLY
WHAT SHOULD IT LOOK LIKE
WE REALLY TOOK A LOOK AT WHERE WE WANT TO BE IN 2050 AND WE HIGHLIGHTED AREAS THAT WE
EVERY COMPANY HAS THEIR OWN PHILOSOPHY
YOU CAN HARDLY GET AROUND
WE TAKE ALL OF THE DATA FROM ALL THOSE SENSORS AND CREATE THE PROGRAMS THAT ALLOW THE CARS TO DRIVE THEMSELVES
AND THIRDLY HOW CAN WE IMPROVE PEOPLE'S LIVES ESPECIALLY THOSE OF THE ELDERLY AND THE DISABLED
AND THIS IS REALLY WHERE SMART MOBILITY PLAYS A HUGE ROLE
THIS IS REALLY JUST THE BEGINNING NOW WE NEED TO APPLY THE HUMAN INTELLIGENCE MAKE THE
IN THE MITOCHONDRIA AS WELL
THAT'S THE GOLD STANDARD THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN BE HEALTHY AND LOSE WEIGHT
THE MAIN REASON IS EXERCISE
I'M NOT AGAINST THAT INDUSTRY OF COURSE BUT IF YOU HAVEN'T EXERCISED IN RECENT MEMORY THAT'S
DENTISTS LOVE THEM BY THE WAY
SO THEY HAVE AN AMAZING MITOCHONDRIA
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO THAT RIGHT
AND THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO KNOW
AND THAT CAUSES MITOCHONDRIAL DYSFUNCTION
SO IT'S WHAT I THINK
AND FOR THAT ELITE ENDURANCE ATHLETES IS THE WAY TO GO
WE KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE
GOING BACK TO THE EXAMPLE OF NUTRITION
IF YOU GO IN THIS COUNTRY IN THE U
WE'RE NOT CHANGING
THEY HAVE THE MOST DEVELOPED MITOCHONDRIA OF ANY HUMAN
WE HAVE NO IDEA
ELITE ENDURANCE ATHLETES
AND THAT'S A REFERENCE FOR EXAMPLE
EINSTEIN SAID THAT WE CANNOT SOLVE A PROBLEM WITH THE SAME INTELLIGENCE WE HAD WHEN WE CREATED IT
IT'S A KEY DISTINCTION
TAKE FOR EXAMPLE HOW LOOKING AT SIMPLY SOMEONE'S RACE WOULD GIVE YOU AN UNTRUE VIEW OF WHO THEY ARE
AND WOULD MAKE MORE PROGRESS
AND WE DID DO IT
THIS WAS INCONTROVERTIBLE PROOF THAT THE EARTH WAS NOT THE CENTER OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM WHICH WAS EFFECTIVELY
THIS BLASTOCYST IS AN AMAZINGLY COMPLICATED STRUCTURE
BRIAN THIS MIGHT BE THE ULTIMATE COSMIC WILD GOOSE CHASE BUT WE SHOULD DO IT
IT BLOWS MY MIND
IT'S THE MOTHER OF CURIOSITY
IT S ONE OF THE GREAT GIFTS THAT WE GET
EVERYONE WAS THERE
FIRST A GRAMMAR QUERY
EVERY PUBLICATION HAS A HOUSE STYLE
GENERALLY IF I THINK SOMETHING IS WRONG I QUERY IT THREE TIMES
I TOLD SANDY THAT NOT LONG AGO IN A MOMENT OF INDISCRETION AND HE SAID ONLY THREE
SO HE HAS LEARNED TO HOLD OUT
I FOUND MYSELF BECOMING A LITTLE BIT OF A TECHNOPHOBE
AND WE WERE IN CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW NOTHING HAD CHANGED SINCE THE TIME OF THE ANCIENT INDIAN EPIC THE
WE'RE HARNESSING ENERGY FROM THE SUN
IT WASN'T EASY BUT THE CHANGE WAS MADE
HOW COULD THIS POSSIBLY BE
ONE OF THE PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES IN GREECE IS AMONG THE TOP 40 AS WELL
PROBABLY THE GREATEST SINGLE STRENGTH OF THE US SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION IS THE DIVERSITY OF
BUT IN THOSE YEARS OF STRUGGLE AND CHALLENGE SOME AMAZING THINGS HAPPENED SOME FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES WERE MADE
ACTUALLY IN 1978 WHEN I GRADUATED WITH MY PHD FROM STANFORD UNIVERSITY AND JOINED
BUT BY 2030 THREE GREEK UNIVERSITIES WERE IN THE WORLD'S TOP 40
TOGETHER WITH PROF
ONE STUDENT WAS ASKING
I SAW THAT IT WAS NOT ABOUT JUST TRANSMITTING KNOWLEDGE IT WAS ABOUT GIVING A NEW
IT TOOK YEARS UNTIL I REALLY GOT IT
IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF FEELINGS
WELL AS IT TURNS OUT I AM IN A GOOD COMPANY
SO BY COMPARISON BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT EXAMPLES WHICH ONE CAN SEE ARE ALL RELATED WE ALL
I WAS VERY DYSLEXIC AS A CHILD WHICH IS WHY I HAD TO HAVE HELP WITH THE LETTER TO SUCH AN EXTENT
ZEBRAS TIGERS AND SO ON THIS CHEMICAL PHENOMENA
I MADE A LIST OF 100 GOALS AND I NEEDED A TIMELINE IN WHICH TO ACHIEVE THOSE
WE THEN HAVE TO START IF WE HAVE KIDS SAVING FOR THEIR COLLEGE FUND AND SO ON
PERHAPS TRAVELING WAS WHAT I WANTED TO DO NEXT SO I NEEDED TO SELL THE HOUSE
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M GOING TO DO NEXT
SO WE STARTED AN AFTERSCHOOL FOR OUR PARENTS FOR OUR MOTHERS
WHEN YOU WATCH HER POWER MOVE
WHAT I ASSUMED WHEN I WATCHED THE POLICEMAN WALK UP IS THAT YOU KNOW I WAS IN TROUBLE OR SOMETHING BUT HE WASN'T THINKING
WHY ARE WE DOING THIS
LIKE THAT IS DONE AND WE HAVE TO DELETE OUR FOOTAGE
WHY FILM DANCE IN THE STREETS
AND THE FIRST THING HE ASKED THEM IS DO YOU SPEAK HEBREW
BECAUSE IN THE STREETS IS WHERE THERE'S HISTORY OF LOCATIONS THEMSELVES AND THE ABILITY FOR YOU TO CAPTURE
PRETTY MUCH PUTTING YOURSELF INTO THE GENESIS OF THAT LOCATION'S TIMELINE
THIS IS WHEN WE'RE FILMING AND PEOPLE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO SAY AS THE FILMING'S HAPPENING BUT THEY APPROACH US AFTERWARDS AND ASK
WE'RE GOING TO CALL THAT GUY BILL
THE SOCIETAL ONE IS A LOT MORE CHALLENGING
I STARTED MY TALK WITH QUOTES FROM WORDSMITHS WHO WERE SEPARATED BY AN OCEAN AND A CENTURY
ON A DAILY BASIS ON A MOMENT TO MOMENT BASIS
WE CAN LOOK BACK AT MISTAKES WE'VE MADE
SOME OF US WON'T BE HERE IN A YEAR'S TIME
I WANT TO HONOR WHERE MY HEART IS LEADING ME
TODAY FOR EXAMPLE I SPENT 15 MINUTES JUST LYING ON THE AUTUMN LEAVES OVER IN THE
IT'S NOT ABOUT BEING SELFISH
WHAT I FOUND OVER TIME THOUGH WAS THAT MY ROLE THE PHYSICAL DUTIES I DID
IF I DIDN'T TRY TO INCORPORATE THEM I TOO WOULD REGRET THAT
IF WE CAN LOOK AT DEATH AND REALIZE WE ARE GOING TO DIE
DO THESE JEANS MAKE ME LOOK FAT
DO I HAVE MUFFIN TOP
SO MY COAUTHOR PHANISH PURANAM WHO HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF THE SMARTEST PEOPLE I KNOW SAID HE'S GOING TO DO A STUDY
IT'S ABOUT HOW DO YOU CREATE A NEW PRODUCT OR DEVELOP A NEW PRODUCT OR MANUFACTURE A NEW PRODUCT BUT NOT A NEW PRODUCT
AND A SIMILAR PATENT FILED OUT OF THE SAME COMPANY'S SUBSIDIARY IN INDIA SO HE'S NOW COMPARING THE PATENTS
THEY WERE WORKING ON TRULY GLOBAL PRODUCTS AND COMPANIES LIKE MICROSOFT GOOGLE ASTRAZENECA
WHAT HE DID WAS HE LOOKED AT THOSE COMPANIES THAT HAD AN R AMP AMP D CENTER IN USA AND IN INDIA
AND 150000 ARE IN INDIA
INDIAN INSTITUTES AND EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS ARE INCAPABLE OF PRODUCING
WITH R AMP AMP D CENTERS IN INDIA OF THE SAME COMPANY TO FIND OUT WHAT IS THE QUALITY OF THE PATENTS FILED OUT OF THE INDIAN CENTERS
R AMP AMP D SUBSIDIARY IS IDENTICAL TO THE NUMBER OF FORWARD CITATIONS OF A PATENT FILED BY AN INDIAN
WILL INDIA GO FROM BEING A FAVORED DESTINATION FOR SOFTWARE SERVICES AND BACK OFFICE SERVICES TO A
IT TURNED OUT IN EVERY SINGLE CASE THEY CAME OUT OF THE INDIAN EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM
WHEN YOU ASK WHERE ARE THE INDIAN GOOGLES IPODS AND VIAGRAS
AND THEY SAID YEAH IT'S OKAY YOU CAN DO THAT
MORE THAN AN ORGANIZATION PROJECT POTENTIAL IS A MIND SET
AND WHAT DO YOU WANT YOUR LEGACY TO BE
YOU WOULDN'T GET IT ANYWAY
RECENTLY SOMEONE ASKED SUHANI WHAT'S YOUR VISION
AND WHY NOT
CREATE SHARED OBJECTIVES INSTEAD OF OBSTACLES AND EMPOWER DREAMS INSTEAD OF FURTHERING
IT'S TIME FOR US TO BEGIN IDENTIFYING CELEBRATING AND BUILDING ON THE STRENGTHS THAT PEOPLE
WE NEED TO FOCUS ON POTENTIAL IN PLACE OF PROBLEMS
WHAT'S YOUR VISION FOR YOUR VILLAGE
THE STORIES WE TELL HAVE PROFOUND EFFECTS ON WHAT WE EXPECT FROM PEOPLE AND THEREFORE ON HOW WE INTERACT WITH THEM
WE WILL PROBABLY GIVE HER HANDOUTS WITHOUT SEEKING TO INVOLVE HER IN THE PROCESS
THE RATS LABELED AS BRIGHT SOLVED THE MAZE MUCH QUICKER THAN THE RATS LABELED AS DULL
EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT I REACH OUT AND TALK TO PEOPLE FROM ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD I KNOW THAT I'M LEARNING NEW
SO BY LOOKING AT WHAT THE USERS ARE DEMANDING OF EACH PLATFORM WHAT VINE USERS DISLIKE ABOUT
WE AS INDIVIDUALS ALL HAVE UNIQUE ASSETS THAT MAKE US VALUABLE IN THIS WORLD
SO BEFORE THE INTERNET NEIGHBORHOODS WOULD GATHER AT BARBECUES OR A PORCH
AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF THIS IS CROWDFUNDING
SO YOU'RE A MAC OR YOU'RE A PC RIGHT
THERE'S SOMETHING WEIRD HAPPENING
AND AS I SAY I'M NOT A NEUROSCIENTIST BUT TO UNDERSTAND HOW I CAN START TO ASSEMBLE THINGS THAT WILL VERY
IT'S SOMETHING MUCH BIGGER
SOUND LIKE ONE MORNING I COULD WAKE UP AND SEE MY SON AS A REPEAT OF LAST WEEK'S STORY
SO TO HAVE THE IDEA TRULY WORK OUT NOT ONLY DID I HAVE TO GATHER THE PERMISSION OF MY PARENTS TO GO AND WORK IN ANOTHER CITY BUT
GO TO THAT NEW RESTAURANT
I RECEIVED AN EMAIL FROM A PROFESSOR OF HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL WHO TOLD ME THAT IF I SENT RECOMMENDATION LETTERS AND MY
INSTEAD OF GOVERNMENT WE THINK OF ANARCHY
EXPLORE THAT NEW IDEA YOU HAD
ANOTHER PROBLEM ALSO EXISTED
I SOON REALIZED THAT MOST LABS IN MY HOMETOWN OF MONTGOMERY ALABAMA DID NOT HAVE SPOTS FOR HIGH
SURE I HAD NO PERSONAL CONTACTS BUT AFTER BROWSING THROUGH TONS OF ARTICLES ONLINE I REALIZED THAT
SOME SAID NO NICELY SOME IGNORED MY EMAIL
IN FACT I SEE THE ROOT OF THIS TYPE OF CELEBRATION THROUGHOUT HISTORY AND AROUND THE WORLD EVERYDAY
NAZI LEADERS TOLD THE KING TO MARK ALL JEWS WITH THE STAR OF DAVID
TOLERANCE IS WHERE WE ARE AND TOLERANCE IS THE BAR OUR SOCIETY ASSESSED ITS HIGHEST SCORE
IMAGINE THE CURRICULUM IN AMERICA BASED ON THE ACCEPTANCE OF ALL CULTURES IN OUR NATION AND IN THE WORLD
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT US
BECAUSE ONCE THEY WERE ON BOARD THEY CALLED THEIR FRIENDS WHO CALLED THEIR FRIENDS WHO CALLED THEIR FRIENDS
ORG WEBSITE AND ALL THE SPOTS WE HAD ALREADY DONE
AND IF WE TEAM TOGETHER WE ARE A POWER THAT CAN INCITE CHANGE
THEY BUY PRODUCTS ON DEMAND
BUT THE TRUTH IS FLORENCE E
ALWAYS LOOK A PERSON IN THE EYE
MY FAVORITE VIEW
THE RAIL BENEATH WHICH THE TWO RIVERS CRASHED TOGETHER IN A SENSE CREATING
HE SAID COME ON I'LL GIVE YOU 5 IF YOU CAN SLAP ME ON THE CHEEK
SO THIS IS MY LITTLE SECRET TO GIVE YOU
HOW ABOUT OUR EMOTIONS
LIFE IS ALWAYS GOING TO COME DOWN TO THAT WHETHER IT TAKES US A FEW MINUTES OR A FEW MONTHS OR YEARS
IF YOU WANT TO BECOME OBSESSED ABOUT SOMETHING I'LL TELL YOU HOW
I SAID DON'T WORRY
I HAVE TO TELL YOU
AND THE DAY AFTER THAT DO ONE JUMPING JACK
CAN WE CONTROL OUR EMOTIONS
I WOULD JUST SAY HI MY NAME IS DAN
THE QUESTION ALWAYS REMAINS BEFORE US
IS IT INNATE OR DEVELOPED
I TRAINED THE TOP US OLYMPIAN AS WELL
DID YOU HEAR WHAT I WAS JUST SAYING
MY EARLIEST CHILDHOOD MEMORIES ARE OF TRIPLE BEAM SCALES USED TO WEIGH OUTRAGEOUS AMOUNTS OF
IT'S AMAZING IT'S CHALLENGING BUT IT'S ALSO FUN
JUST SIT DOWN
SO THIS IS WHAT WE LEARN IN THE ONE ROOM SCHOOLHOUSE
THIS IS THE SCARECROW PART THAT WE LEARN ABOUT
HOW TO INTRODUCE HERSELF
I HAD A GOOD DAY
I KEPT THINKING TO MYSELF THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS HOSPITAL WHO KNOW A LOT MORE THAN I DO
AND I WOULD SAY HEY WAIT A SECOND
I HOPE NO ONE'S HURT
IT'S BASED ON THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF WISDOM TRADITION IN ASIA
WATCH IT ALL PASS MOMENT BY MOMENT
HE SAID YES YES
IT'S REALLY OBVIOUS
JUST HANG ON
WE WANT IT TO BE TRANSPARENT
YOU CAN HAVE YOUR OWN STORAGE SPACE ONLINE
FOR THAT I'M PROPOSING TWO REQUIREMENTS
YOU ARE TALKING TO THE RIGHT FACEBOOK
WE WANT AN INTERNET THAT IS FAIR
NOT ANY OTHER COMPANY
YOU DON'T NEED PASSWORDS ANYMORE
THIS PRIVATE KEY IS SO SECURE THAT IF SOMEONE WANTS TO RANDOMLY GUESS IT OR CRACK IT THEY WOULD NEED
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH ANY COMPANY AT ALL
ONCE THAT HAPPENS AND I WANT TO TALK TO A FRIEND I WANT TO SEND A MASSAGE THAT COMMUNICATION IS BETWEEN
ONE THERE CAN BE NO MIDDLE MAN
THE MAIN THING THAT IT DOES IS THAT IT GIVES THE POWER BACK TO THE PEOPLE
AND PEOPLE JUST BLINDLY TRUST THAT COMPANY
WHERE IS CNN
AND THESE COMPANIES THAT ISSUE SECURITY CERTIFICATES
THAT HEY I'M ON THE SECURE INTERNET
WHAT TIME IS IT ON MARS
SO THEY LIVED ON MARS TIME FOR A MONTH AND HAD THESE GREAT ADVENTURES LIKE GOING BOWLING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
WILL I WAKE THEM UP
ARE YOU AWAKE
WE DIDN'T START OUT THINKING THAT WE WERE GOING TO NEED MARS WATCHES
IT WAS JUST VERY CONFUSING
AND THAT WAS BECAUSE AGAIN THIS EVENTUALLY BECOMES HARD
OK WE'RE GETTING READY FOR MARS TIME
IS IT OK TO CALL
IT WAS A HUGE BONDING EXPERIENCE WITH THE OTHER MEMBERS ON THE TEAM BUT IT IS
AND I DECIDED OK SO HE NEEDS A MARS WATCH
AND SO HERE I WAS LIVING IN KIND OF THIS DARKENED ENVIRONMENT BUT SO WAS HE
SO THIS ALSO WORKS FOR THE HOUSE FOR AT HOME
YEAH NOT SO MUCH
SO I AM A SPACECRAFT ENGINEER A SPACECRAFT OPERATIONS ENGINEER AT NASA'S JET
AND THESE ROVERS ARE OUR ROBOTIC EMISSARIES
SO WHILE SHE SLEEPS WE WORK ON HER PROGRAM FOR THE NEXT DAY
I'M HERE FOR THE ABSOLUTE WORST REASON
WE TAKE A SELFIE AND WE GOT OFF THE PLANE AND I WALK TO THE BAGGAGE CLAIM
THIS CRAZY THING IS HAPPENING
NEXT DAY GET A NEW PHONE FORGET ABOUT THE OLD ONE
I KIND OF TELL MY FRIENDS ABOUT IT YOU GUYS GOTTA CHECK OUT MY PHONE
IT ENDED LIKE A MOVIE
5MILLION PEOPLE IN SOUTHERN CHINA AND IT'S PRETTY UNEVENTFUL UNTIL I GET ON MY LAST LEG
WE'RE ALWAYS LIKE WHERE'S MY PHONE WHERE'S MY PHONE
WE BECAME VERY PROTECTIVE OF EACH OTHER
BECAUSE I LOST MY CELL PHONE
I MEAN WE ALL KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LOSE YOUR PHONE
IT'S GONE FOREVER
WHY AM I HERE RIGHT NOW
I WAS HAVING HAPPY HOUR A 20 DOLLAR BOTTLE OF WINE JUST HAVING FUN CHATTING WITH MY CO WORKERS I
FREAK OUT YOU TURN THE BAR UPSIDE DOWN EVERYONE GET UP RIGHT NOW I NEED TO FIND MY PHONE
ONE WEEK AFTER WE BEGAN COMPOSTING OUR FIFTH DONOR BODY THE TEMPERATURE INSIDE
WE BELIEVE THAT ACCESS TO ECOLOGICAL DEATH CARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT
THIS PILOT PROGRAM HAS ALLOWED US TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IT'S POSSIBLE TO HARNESS THE INCREDIBLE POWER OF
OUR MODERN FUNERARY PRACTICES ARE DESIGNED TO STAVE OFF THE NATURAL PROCESSES THAT HAPPEN TO A BODY AFTER DEATH
THAT PLANET AFTER ALL SUPPORTS OUR LIVING BODIES OUR WHOLE LIVES
WE WANT TO HELP INDIVIDUALS ORGANIZATIONS AND DOWN THE ROAD MUNICIPALITIES DESIGN AND BUILD
YOU HEAR THE TRAFFIC
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING
THINK OF THE NUMBER OF BLIND PEOPLE
AND I CREATED A PIECE THAT EXPLORES COMPUTER BASED INTUITION IN A PHYSICAL SPACE
AND THE PIECE WILL START BEING ONE WAY THAT WE TEST FOR THE HUMANNESS OF A CONVERSATION AND THE PARTS THAT GET LOST IN
SO WHEN YOU WALK IN FRONT OF IT IT STARTS TO USE ALL OF THE DATA THAT IT'S CAPTURED THROUGHOUT ITS EXHIBITION HISTORY
LIKE HUMAN INTUITION
SO IN THE LAB I'VE BEEN CREATING ART AS A WAY TO HELP ME DESIGN BETTER EXPERIENCES FOR BLEEDING EDGE
I'VE BEEN COLLABORATING WITH A CONVERSATION ANALYST AT THE LAB TO TRY TO HELP OUR AI SYSTEMS HOLD MORE HUMAN
AND WE CALL THIS THE UNCANNY VALLEY
I WAS SERIOUS ABOUT MY FAITH HOPING TO ONE DAY DISCOVER A TONIC OF SPIRITUAL DISCIPLINES THAT
THE CONVERSATIONS WERE TOUGH AT FIRST
AND THEN I WRITE ABOUT IT ON MY BLOG SO I'M TELLING PEOPLE HERE'S HOW YOU GROW A TOMATO AND THEN I'M
EVEN THOUGH WE ARE REALLY REALLY EARLY IN THE PROCESS OF THAT PROJECT IT'S SO FASCINATING AND I HAVE
IT HAS TO BE THE EXCEPTIONS
AND YOUNG MINDS A CHARITY THAT WORKS IN THE UK IN 2014 DID EXACTLY THAT
BUT INSTEAD OUR GOVERNMENT DECIDED TO ASPIRE TO AN EDUCATION SYSTEM LIKE THEY HAVE IN KOREA WHERE
WHEN I WAS BORN IN 1981 MY DAD HAD A MARKET STORE AND MY MUM WAS AN ASSISTANT BUYER FOR A
BETWEEN THE AGES OF 24 AND 35 SUICIDE ACCOUNTS FOR ONE IN FOUR MALE
THEY SURVEYED 5000 YOUNG PEOPLE
TAKE FOR EXAMPLE LAST WEEK
IN SCANDINAVIA YOU DON'T GO TO SCHOOL UNTIL YOU ARE EIGHT
WE ALSO INCIDENTALLY TRAIL BEHIND COUNTRIES IN SCANDINAVIA IN NUMERACY AND LITERACY
SHE LOOKS LOVELY I DON'T SEE THE PROBLEM
THERE ARE SO MANY TOXIC IDEAS THAT PERMEATE OUR SOCIETY THE NARRATIVE BY WHICH WE
YOU CAN'T GET AWAY FROM THAT
AND THE PROBLEM ABOUT CONVERSATIONS SURROUNDING ADVERTISING IS THAT NOBODY EVER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE IMPACT IS CUMULATIVE
BUT THEY COULD AFFORD A MORTGAGE ON A MODEST PROPERTY THEY COULD AFFORD TO RUN A CAR AND THEY COULD AFFORD TO FEED AND CLOTHE
YOU SAY WHAT'S CAUSING THIS
AND THAT SOUNDS STUPID BUT THERE IS ACTUALLY SOME REALLY GOOD EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT THEORY THAT THE TWO ARE
SO THEY HAVEN'T HURT THEMSELVES AS SEVERELY AS US BUT FOR US IT MEANT THAT WE BROKE OUR LEGS
I'M ONE THIRD OF AN ORGANIZATION CALLED THE SELF ESTEEM TEAM AND WE TRAVEL SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES THROUGHOUT THE UK AND
WE KNOW THAT HOSPITALIZATIONS FOR SELF HARM AND EATING DISORDERS HAVE DOUBLED IN THE PAST THREE YEARS
AND OF COURSE CHANGE IS SCARY
SO MOST OF US GO BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN BEING UPRIGHT AND TENSE WHICH WE THINK IS GOOD POSTURE BUT
THIS IS LIKE YOUR FOUNDATION
DREAMS FALL INTO A RARE CATEGORY OF SUBJECTS THAT ARE BOTH NON CONFRONTATIONAL AND INTERESTING
POLITICS AND ECONOMIC ISSUES AND SOCIAL ISSUES
AND IT CREATES AN INCOHERENT STORY LINE I'M SURE MANY OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH
THERE'LL BE AN IMMEDIATE REACTION YOU KNOW PEOPLE SAYING OH WHAT WAS IT
AND SHE PULLED ME OVER AND I SAID WHAT IT IS
THINK ABOUT THEM WRITE THEM DOWN TALK ABOUT THEM WITH PEOPLE
ALL OF THEM CREATE BARRIERS BETWEEN PEOPLE RATHER THAN UNIFYING US
SO ON THE SUBJECT OF EVERYTHING BEING CONNECTED I WOULD ENCOURAGE ALL OF YOU TO GO OUT AND PUT MORE EMPHASIS ON YOUR DREAMS
SO AT FIRST I WAS LIKE THAT'S COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS
PLATO SAID THAT IF YOU PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR DREAMS THEY CAN ACTUALLY GIVE YOU INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO BEHAVE IN YOUR OWN
THAT WAS A MESS
I NEED TO ORDER THIS
LIFE HAS BEEN KIND
BUT OVER TIME I REALIZED THAT HELPING SOMEONE GET TO THAT AHA MOMENT FOR THEM TO REALIZE
I HAD AN INTERVIEW AND I GOT THE JOB
GOT IN TROUBLE
SO I PUT IN AN APPLICATION
HIS CLOTHES WERE DIRTY AND TATTERED AND EVEN THOUGH IT WAS WARM HE WAS WEARING MANY LAYERS OF CLOTHING
EVERY DAY THAT I WENT TO WORK I WAS HELPING SOMEONE HAVE ACCESS TO MATERIALS THAT THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE OTHERWISE HAD
MY FAMILY WAS WALKING THOUGH BALBOA PARK IN SAN DIEGO CALIFORNIA AND I SAW A MAN SLEEPING ON A BENCH
JUST DIDN'T REALLY CARE
SURE I'D HEARD THINGS ABOUT THE HOMELESS
THINGS LIKE THEY WERE LAZY THEY'RE DRUNKS WHY DON'T THEY JUST GET A JOB
I HAD BEEN CAST OFF FROM SOCIETY
WE KNOW WHERE IT'S GOTTEN WARMER
THE QUESTION YOU HAVE TO ASK IS WHETHER A MODEL TELLS YOU MORE INFORMATION THAN YOU WOULD HAVE HAD
WE KNOW THAT IT'S GOTTEN WARMER
ONE EXTRA ORDER OF MAGNITUDE IN SPACE IS 10000 TIMES MORE CALCULATIONS
NOW I USE THE WORD SKILL ADVISEDLY MODELS ARE NOT RIGHT OR WRONG THEY'RE ALWAYS WRONG
NOBODY DOUBTS THAT THIS IS HAPPENING IN WASHINGTON
THIS IS WHERE WE ARE AS A COUNTRY
SO FOR A LOT OF REASONS THOSE DECADES AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR WERE AN HISTORICALLY ANOMALOUS TIME
NOW THE RIGHT HAS BEEN SCREAMING ABOUT THIS ASTEROID SINCE THE 1960S AND THE LEFT HAS BEEN SAYING IT'S NOT A
IT FEELS REALLY SATISFYING
AND WE WILL NEVER AGAIN HAVE A LARGE GROUP OF CONSERVATIVE SOUTHERN DEMOCRATS AND
IT'S ALSO STABILITY VERSUS CHAOS
SOMETIMES A SINGLE THREAT CAN POLARIZE US AS WE SAW
AND TRYING TO RUN CONGRESS WITHOUT HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS IS LIKE TRYING TO RUN A CAR WITHOUT MOTOR OIL
AS I KNOW FROM WORKING WITH STREET CHILDREN IN BRAZIL MOM'S BOYFRIEND IS OFTEN A REALLY REALLY DANGEROUS PERSON FOR
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM
SOME OF US ARE SITTING THERE SAFE AND SOUND IN GIGANTIC PRIVATE YACHTS
THEY DON'T MEET EACH OTHER'S SPOUSES OR CHILDREN
THERE'S NO MORE RELATIONSHIP THERE
WE CAN DO IT
BUT IT IS A GROSS DISTORTION OF REALITY
CAN'T YOU SEE REALITY
I'M TALKING INSTEAD ABOUT THREATS THAT ARE HEADED OUR WAY BUT THEY'RE WRAPPED IN A SPECIAL ENERGY FIELD THAT POLARIZES US
TO UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS HAPPENING TO US AND WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT WE NEED TO LEARN MORE ABOUT MORAL PSYCHOLOGY
THE LEFT HAS BEEN VERY RELUCTANT TO SAY THAT MARRIAGE IS ACTUALLY GOOD FOR WOMEN AND FOR CHILDREN
WHAT ARE YOU STRUGGLING WITH
WHAT DO YOU DO
YOU HAVE A CONVERSATION
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU BEEN IN LECTURE HALLS LIKE THIS ONE
SO ONE APPROACH MIGHT BE TO TELL EVERY PROFESSOR OUT THERE YOU NEED TO SPEND A COUPLE OF HOURS WITH EACH STUDENT ONE ON
IT SOUNDS KIND OF FUNNY RIGHT
WHAT IS AGAINST THE ORDER OF NATURE IS THE ONGOING PERSECUTION OF THE SEXUAL MINORITY
BUT THESE DAYS OPEN HOMOPHOBIA IS BEING REPLACED BY MORE OF A SUBTLE HETEROSEXISM WHERE PEOPLE IN THE
THAT'S COMPLETELY UNTRUE
I MEAN GAYS HAVE 80 FEWER KIDS THAN HETEROSEXUALS
THIS IS A TRAIT THAT OUGHT TO GO EXTINCT IN A FEW GENERATIONS BUT DOWN THROUGH RECORDED HISTORY IN EVERY
THANKFULLY THE SEXUAL MINORITY THESE DAYS HAVE MANY OPTIONS FOR HAVING KIDS OF THEIR OWN AND I HAVE A
AND HOLLY MORGAN TOLD ME THAT SHE USED TO BATTLE DEPRESSION UNTIL SHE GOT INVOLVED WITH EFFECTIVE ALTRUISM
COM AND GIVING WHAT WE CAN BOTH HAVE A SOMEWHAT BROADER LIST BUT YOU CAN FIND
THERE'S ABOUT 100 PEOPLE EACH YEAR IN THE U
CHARLIE BRESLER SAID TO ME THAT HE'S NOT AN ALTRUIST
THAT IS GOOD
AND THE ANSWER IS YES WE CAN
ACCORDING TO ONE ESTIMATE THE GATES FOUNDATION HAS ALREADY SAVED 5
THINK ABOUT IT
I HAD TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT AND STOP COLLUDING
IT IS NOT HAVING A VAGINA THAT MAKES LIFE HARDER FOR WOMEN
THEY'RE BASICALLY RETAINING THEIR JUVENILE CHARACTERISTICS VERY LATE IN WHAT WE CALL
FOURTH GRADERS LOVE THEIR DINOSAURS THEY MEMORIZE THEM
I'VE DISCOVERED HOW I SHOW UP AND HOW I MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES
AND SO WE ALLOWED MULTINATIONALS INTO INDIA
OBVIOUSLY THERE WERE
THEY SAY WHAT DID THE DOCTOR SAY
OF COURSE I WAS INTERESTED IN THE OPINIONS OF DOCTORS AND
AND THE CURRENT STRATEGY SPANS THE WHOLE WORLD AND THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF HUMAN HISTORY
HOW SURE ARE YOU THAT WHAT SOCIETY PERCEIVES TO BE THE CHILD LEFT BEHIND IS WHAT'S NOT
WHAT IS HAPPINESS ACCORDING TO YOU
THIS USED TO BE SOMETHING THAT CONFLICTED MY THOUGHTS AND LIFE
SO I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF ANY OF YOU ASKED ME
AND HE STARTED TO FOLLOW HIS SPECIAL ABOUT THE PHOTOGRAPHY
BUT YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE THE JERK WHO SAYS WELL I GUESS YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE GONE SKIING THEN
BECAUSE THE PROBLEM IS NOT SEXTING THE ISSUE IS DIGITAL PRIVACY
AND WE CAN DO THE SAME THING WITH DIGITAL PRIVACY
THINK ABOUT HAVING SURGERY
RIGHT NOW IF I SEND YOU AN IMAGE YOU CAN FORWARD THAT TO ANYONE THAT YOU WANT
SO IT'S A STARTING POINT
I'M NOT ADVOCATING FOR TEENAGERS TO HAVE SEX
WHO EATS THAT
BUT WHAT DO YOU WANT
THAT WOULDN'T QUIET BE CORRECT RIGHT
REDUCTIONISM WOULD SAY
IT WAS HANDED DOWN TO US BY THE GREEKS
I'VE SEEN WAVES HAPPEN ON WATER
THE FEAR ALONE CAN BE PARALYZING
BUT IT IS THE CHOICE THAT YOU MUST MAKE
IT'S ABOUT TIME TO FULLY LIVE YOUR LIFE
FOR ME WHAT I FIND AS MOST HELPFUL IS MEDITATION
FOR ME I AM A PLANNER BY NATURE
CHECK IT OFF
AND AFTER ALL THAT THE KNITTERS ACTUALLY FAILED TO BREAK THE WORLD RECORD
HOW DID WE GET THERE
WE HAVE TO GO BACK TO 2009 WHEN ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES GOT A GREAT IDEA
HE CAME AT 9 A
BECAUSE ALL I KNEW GROWING UP WAS THAT MY DAD LOVED MY GRANDPA AND GRANDPA LOVED
WHEN I WOULD HEAR OTHER PEOPLE SAY
AND WHEN I LOOKED AROUND I BEGAN TO SEE WHAT MY TRUTH REALLY WAS
ABSQUATULATE IS A PERFECTLY GOOD WORD OF ENGLISH
MOTEL IS A BLEND OF MOTOR AND HOTEL
AND NEW WORDS GRAB PEOPLE'S ATTENTION
YOU CAN ALSO TAKE ADJECTIVES AND MAKE THEM INTO NOUNS
SO WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR A LONG TIME
NOW THESE KINDS OF NATURAL RULES THAT EXIST IN YOUR BRAIN THEY'RE NOT LIKE TRAFFIC LAWS THEY'RE
SO THESE ARE BLEND WORDS LIKE BRUNCH IS A BLEND OF BREAKFAST AND LUNCH
WE ONLY CHANGED THEIR BEHAVIOR
I DO COUPLES THERAPY AND IT CAN BE A WONDERFUL THING
WE NEED TO HELP PEOPLE GENUINELY KNOW WHAT THEY WANT AND NEED IN A RELATIONSHIP
THERE IS A LARGE BODY OF LITERATURE ON ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS THAT HAS IDENTIFIED THE FEATURES OF HEALTHY
IF I PROMISE TO PROTECT SOME TIME FOR US WILL YOU BE OK WITH ME TAKING THIS JOB
AND THEY ARE BETTER AT PROVIDING HELPFUL SUPPORT WHEN NEEDED
OR MAYBE YOU'LL REALIZE IT'S JUST THE OPPOSITE THAT YOU'RE NOT READY TO SETTLE DOWN AND YOU NEED A PARTNER WHO IS OK
IT'S TOO LATE
SO MAYBE SHE WAS FEELING KIND OF ANXIOUS
THIS IS WHAT THE NOTION OF ROMANTIC COMPETENCE IS ALL ABOUT
EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE OK
WE HAVE DATA TO SUPPORT THIS AS WELL
WHAT YOU REALLY NEED IS TO RELAX A LITTLE BIT SO IT DOESN'T BLEED OUT OVER INTO YOUR RELATIONSHIP
AND THIS BRINGS ME BACK TO MY POINT THAT WE NEED TO BE TEACHING PEOPLE HOW TO HAVE HEALTHY
INSIGHT ALSO WOULD HAVE LET HER KNOW THAT HER PARTNER WAS THE KIND OF GUY WHO WAS JUST GOING TO TAKE WHAT SHE SAID
WITH EMOTION REGULATION YOU'LL BE ABLE TO TELL YOURSELF YOU KNOW WHAT
SO MAYBE YOU'LL RECOGNIZE THAT YOU'RE THE KIND OF PERSON WHO TENDS TO JUMP IN REALLY QUICKLY YOU GET WRAPPED UP IN THE
I'VE BEEN STUDYING ROMANTIC COMPETENCE THE ABILITY FOR PEOPLE TO USE INSIGHT MUTUALITY AND EMOTION
AFTER IT'S TOO LATE
SO THEY ARE MORE WILLING TO ASK FOR WHAT THEY NEED AND USE WHAT THEIR PARTNERS GIVE THEM
WITH INSIGHT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO LEARN FROM YOUR MISTAKES IN WAYS THAT ALLOW YOU TO BEHAVE DIFFERENTLY IN THE FUTURE
BUT MANY PEOPLE COME TO COUPLES THERAPY WITH SO MANY INGRAINED PROBLEMS AND PATTERNS THAT THEY
AND BECAUSE THEY REPRESENT THE COMMONALITIES WE THINK THEY REALLY CAN HELP PEOPLE WITH ALL THE
NOW TOWARDS THIS END MY COLLEAGUES AND I HAVE DEVELOPED A SKILLS BASED MODEL OF RELATIONSHIP
I'M GOING TO FIGURE THIS OUT
I MEAN THE BEGINNING BEGINNING LIKE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
THIS IS THE WORST THING EVER
AND WOULDN'T ALL OF OUR RELATIONSHIPS BENEFIT FROM THIS
ATYPICAL SEXUAL ACTIVITIES LIKE SEXUAL INTERCOURSE WHICH CAN BE CONSIDERED PRETTY RISKY FOR A
SO YOU MIGHT THINK
WITH INSIGHT YOU MIGHT NOTICE OR REALIZE THAT IT'S NOT THAT YOUR PARTNER IS DOING ANYTHING BUT ACTUALLY YOU'RE
RESEARCHERS ALSO AGREE ON WHAT MAKES FOR UNHEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS THINGS LIKE FIGHTING SO MUCH THAT YOU
THERE IS A WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS
IF YOU BEG AND PLEAD TO GET BACK TOGETHER YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF AND YOU DON'T EVEN WANT TO BE IN A
THAT'S JUST WHO YOUR PARTNER IS
THE TEXT IS GOING TO COME
YOU KNOW THIS IS GOING TO BE STRESSFUL FOR ME
THAT TEXT ISN'T COMING YOU'RE GETTING REALLY ANXIOUS YOU'RE CHECKING YOUR PHONE EVERY TWO SECONDS
AND THIS ISN'T JUST WHAT THEY TOLD US WE ACTUALLY OBSERVED THEM DOING THIS IN OUR LABORATORY WHERE WE ASKED THEM TO
WE NEED TO HELP THEM SELECT THE RIGHT PARTNER
I'D REALLY LOVE FOR YOU TO BE THERE YOU'LL BE A REALLY GOOD BUFFER FOR ME
WE IDENTIFIED THE SKILLS BASED ON A THOROUGH REVIEW OF THEORY AND RESEARCH
IN ONE OF OUR STUDIES WE LOOKED AT 13 AND 14 YEAR OLD GIRLS EARLY ADOLESCENT GIRLS AND WE FOUND
SHE DIDN'T GET ANYTHING
WHAT IF THEY SELECTED POORLY
AND RESEARCHERS WOULD AGREE TOO
I KNOW WE ARE SAVING FOR THAT TRIP BUT I REALLY LIKE THAT NECKLACE THAT WE SAW THE OTHER DAY AND IT WASN'T THAT EXPENSIVE
THIS IS GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT
IT'S NOTHING ABOUT YOU OR THE RELATIONSHIP
YOU ARE NOT OK WITH YOUR PARTNER SEEING OTHER PEOPLE
THEY FELT COMFORTABLE BEING CLOSE TO PEOPLE THEY COULD TRUST PEOPLE THEY WEREN'T WORRIED ABOUT BEING REJECTED
I DON'T NEED TO CHECK MY PHONE EVERY SECOND I'M JUST GOING TO PUT IT AWAY AND FOCUS ON THE TASK AT
IT IS CALLED COUPLES THERAPY
THEY'RE ALSO BETTER AT SEEKING AND PROVIDING SUPPORT TO THEIR PARTNERS
HOW MANY PEOPLE KNOW I MEAN REALLY KNOW WHAT TO DO ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS TO
MY POINT IS THIS
AND GIRLS WHO WERE MORE ROMANTICALLY COMPETENT WERE ENGAGING IN FEWER
SO LET'S SAY YOU HAVE A BREAKUP
AND SHE GOT REALLY ANGRY AND THEY HAD A BIG FIGHT
SO LET'S SAY YOU GET A GREAT JOB OFFER THAT YOU'D LIKE TO TAKE BUT YOU KNOW IT MEANS YOU WILL TO HAVE TO WORK MORE AND YOU
WE MAY KNOW WHAT A HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP LOOKS LIKE BUT MOST PEOPLE HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO GET ONE AND
YOU MIGHT SAY DIRECTLY
SO GUESS WHAT
LET'S SAY YOUR PARTNER SHOWS UP LATE FOR A DATE
THAT'S BAD INTENTIONS
RESISTANCE IS FUTILE
DON'T OVEREXAGGERATE POTENTIAL SUPERPOWERS THAT DO NOT EXIST
THE BEST THING IS TO MAKE SURE THE BOX WE USE ISN'T A LIMITATION
SAM IS A TOMBOY WITH A FLAT BRIM HAT AND STRAIGHT BLOND HAIR DOWN HER BELLY BUTTON
WHATEVER THE SCENARIO THINK ABOUT WHY THE BOX IS THERE AND IF IT IS IMPORTANT
ONE TIME I TRIED TO ORGANIZE ALL OF MY BOOKS BY GENRE
WHAT HERS IS
I GUESS IT IS ME BUT NOT REALLY
ONCE I WAS SMOKING CRACK NOTHING ELSE MATTERED
NEW FRIENDS LIKE GINGER WOULD LISTEN TO ME CRY IN THOSE EARLY DAYS WHEN I COULDN'T IMAGINE TELLING
I HAVE HOPE FOR THE FUTURE
I JOURNALED ABOUT MY FEELINGS AND THINGS I WANTED TO SAY TO MY VICTIM
THAT SPARKED SOMETHING INSIDE OF ME
IT WAS GUT WRENCHING WORK BUT NECESSARY FOR MY SURVIVAL
MY FRIENDS WERE HELPING ME TO COME TO TERMS WITH WHO I WAS MY ADDICTION MY
MAY GOD BLESS YOU
AT FIRST I COULDN'T EVEN SAY MY VICTIM'S NAME BUT I KNEW I HAD TO FACE WHAT I'D DONE
MY INCREASING LEVEL OF DEPRAVITY WAS FUELED BY DRUGS AND ALCOHOL
THAT GROUP MADE ME CONFRONT THE REALITY OF WHO I AM AND WHAT I'D DONE
I FELT DEAD INSIDE LIKE MY SOUL WAS GONE
MYRNA HEARD ABOUT MY ARREST AND SHE CONTACTED ME
A LOT OF FRIENDS HELPED ME ALONG THE WAY
I COULD NEVER FORGET
OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS PEOPLE WERE PLACED IN MY LIFE FOR REASONS THAT I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND AT THE TIME
AND BEFORE SHE PASSED AWAY SHE WORKED THE STEPS WITH ME
BUT I WAS ALLOWING A WALL OF DENIAL TO BUILD UP AROUND MY CRIME AND WHY I
FORGIVING MYSELF DOESN'T MEAN THAT I FORGET
IT WASN'T UNTIL I PARTICIPATED IN A VIOLENCE PREVENTION GROUP THAT THAT WALL OF DENIAL
I HAD TO COME TO A PLACE OF ACCEPTANCE
I WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO WRITE SUCH AN HONEST INTROSPECTIVE LETTER HAD I NOT DONE ALL THE
CREATE YOUR OWN PATH OF HEALING AND REDEMPTION
MY PHYSICAL MENTAL AND SPIRITUAL HEALTH ARE VALUABLE TO ME
MANY YEARS AGO
IT BLEW MY MIND THAT PEOPLE WERE WILLING TO FORGIVE ME FOR SOMETHING THAT I CONSIDERED UNFORGIVABLE
I STARTED TO BELIEVE THAT MAYBE THERE WAS HOPE FOR ME
I'M NOT THE SAME PERSON I USED TO BE
I DIDN'T CORRECT PEOPLE WHEN THEY MADE THAT ASSUMPTION
I STOPPED BRUSHING ASIDE THE PSYCHOLOGIST'S SUGGESTIONS AND I BEGAN ACTUALLY DOING THE WORK
MAILING THAT LETTER FREED SOMETHING IN ME
THOSE TWO WORLDS STARTED CRASHING TOGETHER AND THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO TO STOP IT
I KNEW HIS HOPES AND HIS DREAMS FOR THE FUTURE
I KNEW HE LOVED ME
I'M ENGAGED IN LIFE AND I LIVE WITH INTENTION AND DELIBERATENESS
I HAD GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE
IT WAS EASY TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO THINK IT WAS ALL MY CO DEFENDANTS' FAULT
BUT TO HAVE THE GOOGLE APP YOU HAVE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET
IN THESE PROGRESSIONS THEY WERE VERY LABOUR INTENSIVE AND IT WOULD TAKE MANY YEARS TO BECOME ESTABLISHED AT WHAT YOU WERE
NO MATTER THE REVOLUTION THE MOST VALUABLE RESOURCE HAS BEEN AND ALWAYS WILL BE THAT OF HUMAN POTENTIAL
THERE IS A BRILLIANT AFRICAN PROVERB
AND ALSO THE EDUCATION ABOUT HOW A SMARTPHONE WORKS
AND THESE SKILLS AND TRADES ARE ALL IN THE PROCESS OF HAVING PRODUCTION SLOWLY MOVED AWAY FROM PEOPLE AND SLOWLY BEGINNING TO CHANGE THE
AND HERE'S WHERE I SUGGEST WE START
BUT ONLY 26 OF THOSE ON THE LOWEST INCOMES
WE NEED TO PREPARE YOUNG PEOPLE TO TAKE THEIR PLACE IN THE DIGITAL ECONOMY
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SMARTPHONE TO BE ABLE TO USE IT
WE NEED TO START TO THINK ABOUT THE HUMAN IMPLICATIONS OF THIS CHANGE
AND INVOLVED A LOT OF HARD WORK TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD
THE PRINCIPLE OF CHANGING OUR BELIEFS BASED ON WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE WORLD IS NOTHING NEW THE WORLD GOES THROUGH THIS CHANGE
FOR SOMEONE WHO CAN'T DRIVE I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT ONE
YOU'D HAVE LOW PAID YOU'D HAVE HIGH PAID AND YOU'D HAVE YOUR MIDDLE PAID
WE NEED TO START LOOKING AT HOW TO DRIVE A SHIFT IN PRINCIPLES AND BELIEFS FOR THE DIGITAL REVOLUTION
PERSONALLY I DON'T THINK ANYONE CAN SAY THEY MADE IT ALONE
WE ARE INTERDEPENDENT BEINGS IN AN INTERDEPENDENT SOCIETY AND THAT NEEDS TO BE REFLECTED IN THE VALUES WE ARE IMPARTING TO A
BUT ONCE YOU DID YOU WOULD HAVE A CAREER FOR LIFE
SO KNOWLEDGE IS ALWAYS WITHIN REACH IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO ALL THOSE THINGS
AND THAT REALLY GOT ME THINKING
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IN A DAY AND AGE WHERE WE HAVE A GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF THE HUMAN MIND THAN EVER BEFORE THE MOST VALUABLE ASSET THAT WE CAN PASS ON IS
AND IN THE SAME BREATH THEY RECKON THAT ABOUT 16 MILLION PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY LACK BASIC ONLINE
A TOLLGATE IS A BARRIER THAT STOPS PEOPLE FROM MOVING FORWARD AND THINGS LIKE ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY OR THE ABILITY TO
THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN STUCK EARLY ON ARE NOW FALLING FURTHER AND FURTHER BEHIND THOSE WHO ARE AT THE FRONT
WE MUST HELP EVERYONE TO NOT FEEL ISOLATED IN A DIGITAL WORLD
2 MILLION HOUSEHOLDS ARE NOW HOOKED UP TO THE WEB
THE MIDDLE SECTION WOULD CONTAIN JOBS LIKE BOOK KEEPING CLERICAL WORK AND THESE WOULD PROVIDE TYPICALLY
AND WHEN YOU HAVE A POPULATION OF FAST DIVIDING CANCER CELLS IF ONE OF THEM ACQUIRES NEW MUTATIONS WHICH ALLOW THEM
BUT HOW CAN A CANCER SPREAD IN A POPULATION
HER GUTS WERE SWIMMING WITH PARASITIC WORMS
HER BODY WAS RIDDLED WITH SECONDARY TUMORS
NATURAL SELECTION IS SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST
I HAD A SICK BODY THAT WAS ALL
AND IN NORWAY RESEARCHERS ARE RUNNING A PHASE 3 CLINICAL TRIAL ON A CANCER DRUG THAT IN SOME PATIENTS
THE PROBLEM IS THAT THIS CAN CAUSE REAL HARM
BUT IT GAVE ME HOPE THAT I COULD BE TREATED
IT IS A PERFECT CUSTOM PRISON
WHAT WAS STRIKING WAS JUST HOW MUCH TROUBLE WE WERE HAVING BEING TAKEN SERIOUSLY
LIKE THE HYSTERIA OF OLD THIS HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH GENDER AND WITH WHOSE STORIES WE BELIEVE
ANOTHER STUDENT MIGHT SAY
WINSTON CHURCHILL SAID
WE CAN'T SCRIPT THAT
NO I DON'T WANT TO GO THAT DIRECTION
AND YEAH IT'S PRIVATE I CAN'T GET INTO YOUR HEAD YOU CAN'T GET INTO MINE
DO YOU NEED TO ASK PERMISSION TO TALK
IF YOU'RE ENGAGING ON TWITTER INFORMATION IS SWIRLING AROUND IN THIS SPACE VIA
WHAT PERMISSIONS WILL WE GIVE YOU
HOW WILL THEY BOUNCE OFF THAT
IMAGINE YOU WERE IN THAT EVENT HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IN THAT EVENT
I DO THAT ALL THE TIME I'M A MIMIC
AND JUST WHAT AMOUNT OF ENERGY COULD ACTUALLY BE UNLEASHED AS A RESULT OF THAT
FOR ALMOST TWO YEARS WE WENT ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND EVEN VISITED REMOTE
THE COUNTRY WAS DIVIDED AGAIN SO MUCH THAT OUR PARLIAMENT RESIGNED WE
THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME I UNDERSTOOD VISCERALLY JUST FOR A FLEETING MOMENT
WHAT USED TO TAKE THEM MONTHS TO CREATE AND ASSESS A SINGLE POLICY THEY COULD NOW COME TO OUR
HOW DOES HE DO IT WHAT DO YOU MEAN MODEL
THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF ECONOMIC MODELING
WERE PEOPLES' BELIEFS CONSISTENT WITH HOW PUBLIC POLICY WOULD IMPACT THEM
I FELT THAT MOST OF US AT OUR CORE ARE MODERATES
MOST OF US AREN'T NOT GOING TO FORGO THE LIVELIHOODS OF OUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY FOR IDEOLOGY
IT'S LIKE THE BLOOD LIGHTS UP INSIDE YOUR VEINS
WELL GUESS WHAT
THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE
OUR BRAIN CAN'T WAIT ANOTHER YEAR
I ASKED ALEC HOW HE AND HIS WIFE RACHEL MET AND HE TOLD ME THE STORY OF A HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL
HE LIKED HER PURPLE HAIR
DO YOU HOLD IT OPEN FOR THEM
ANOTHER THING WHICH IS VERY PECULIAR FOR QUANTUM MECHANICS IS ENTANGLEMENT OR THE NOTION OF
THIS IS ONE OF THE PARADOXES DEVISED BY ALBERT EINSTEIN WHEN HE TRIED TO CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT THERE ARE SOME
THESE ARE THE THINGS WHY I AM SO IN LOVE WITH QUANTUM PHYSICS WHY I AM SO PASSIONATE ABOUT QUANTUM
BUT AGAIN THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING IN QUANTUM PHYSICS
IF WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND QUANTUM PHYSICS NONE OF THIS WOULD BE EXISTING AROUND US
WE CALL IT QUANTUM WAVE DUALITY
AND I BELIEVE THAT QUANTUM PHYSICS IS SOMETHING IN THAT DIRECTION THAT IT IS SO COMPLICATED
THERE IS THE VERY FAMOUS DOUBLE SLIT EXPERIMENT IN QUANTUM MECHANICS IN WHICH WE ARE CLAIMING THAT THE SAME
WHO WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSONALITY OF THE 20TH CENTURY
WHO WAS THE ONE SINGLE PERSON WHO INFLUENCED OUR ATTITUDE OUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THE
I SAID I'M GOING TO OPEN A THEATER
THIS IS WHAT THIS GROUP IS
NONE OF YOU CAME I'M OVER IT
THAT'S WHAT I DID
AND I SPECIFICALLY LOVED ONE EXPERIENCE IN GENERAL WHICH WAS MY CLASS IMPROVISATION
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER HAD A TIME IN YOUR LIFE WHERE YOU DID SOMETHING AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU
I COULDN'T MAKE A BUSINESS OUT OF THAT
WELL MORE THAN WE THINK
JS WELL IT'S NOT JUST MATHEMATICAL
SO HOW DID YOU STAY AHEAD OF THE PACK
IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME THAT IT WOULD BE APPLIED TO PHYSICS
HERMANN MINKOWSKI HAD THIS GEOMETRY AND EINSTEIN REALIZED HEY
I MEAN I THINK IT WAS PURE LUCK
OKAY NOTHING I CAN DO
I TRIED TO THINK HOW DO I RESPOND TO THAT HOPELESSNESS
WHAT IS THAT SENSE OF HOPELESSNESS
YOU KNOW THERE ARE LESTERS FROM EVERY PART OF SOCIAL SOCIETY
CLIMATE CHANGE IS MINE BUT IT MIGHT BE FINANCIAL REFORM OR A SIMPLER TAX SYSTEM OR INEQUALITY
THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO
YOU WANT TO TOUCH THEM TASTE THEM SMELL THEM YOU CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THEM
WHICH IS TO SAY YOU SHOULD BE AFRAID
A LEGACY OF WOMEN WITH OPEN MOUTHS AND RIGID SPINES
I HOPE YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE CRUNCH OF AN OCEAN PUNCHED INTO YOUR JAW
LIKE THEY TOOK ALL OF THE WICKED OUT OF MY WITCH
IT IS HARD TO BE POWERFUL WHEN YOU ARE CONSTANTLY BENDING YOUR BONES INTO MORE SWALLOWABLE SHAPES
THE SLAM OF METAL A POOR SUBSTITUTE FOR BONE AND MY SISTER DOES WHAT ALL GIRLS KNOW HOW TO DO WHICH IS TO
YOU TAKE OUT ONE EIGHTH
THEY WERE CONVINCED I WAS A TOOL IN THE HANDS OF THE ISRAELI PROPAGANDA
EVERYTHING IS IN PLACE EVERYTHING IS IN HARMONY IN FLOW
MY PARENTS ARE BOTH HIGHLY EDUCATED AND LIBERAL PEOPLE MY BACKGROUND WAS NOT RELIGIOUS NOR
I LEARNED HOW TO KEEP THE BALANCE BETWEEN WHAT IS EXPECTED FROM ME BY MY SURROUNDINGS AND WHAT I REALLY WANTED IN
I CAN FINALLY DROP THE BALANCING ACT AND START LIVING MY LIFE RIGHT
IT'S ALMOST SET IT AND FORGET IT
WHY SPECIFICALLY MAGNETIC BACTERIA
EACH OF THEM HAS ONE OR MORE CHAINS OF TINY MAGNETIC CRYSTALS CALLED MAGNETISMS
WELL THEY HELP US BOTH WITH READING AND WRITING THE DATA
LIKE ROTEM I FOUND IT FASCINATING AND SPENT THE NEXT FEW WEEKS DIGGING UP INFORMATION ON MAGNETIC BACTERIA
WITH ROTTEN I CHANGED IMPROVED AND REFINED IT UNTIL WE GOT TO A CONCEPT
AND THIS ALLOWS US THE FANTASTIC ABILITY OF HAVING OUR DATA DUPLICATE ITSELF
BUT FILM AND VIDEO DOES FLATTEN SCULPTURE SO I TRIED TO IMAGINE A WAY THAT

MOTION SENSORS WOULD BE INSTALLED INSIDE THE TILES OF BATHROOM FLOORS TO DETECT THE FALLS OF ELDERLY PATIENTS WHENEVER THEY

AND SHE LOOKED INTO HER BABY'S EYES AND SHE SAID OF COURSE I LOVE MY BABY
WE ARE SO ACCUSTOMED TO ROBBING GIRLS OF THE SUBJECT OF BEING THE SUBJECTS OF THEIR LIVES THAT WE
IT'S ALL BAD
IT'S MY BABY AND IT'S FULL OF LOVE
AND I WILL BE IN YOUR CORNER FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO SHUT ME DOWN OR TURN ME OFF
I'VE SEEN GIRLS WHO WERE BEATEN BY THEIR MOTHERS AND BROTHERS AND FATHERS AND
HOW COULD I NOT LOVE MY BABY
HE SAID YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL
JACLYN WAS 14 YEARS OLD AND SHE WAS IN HER MASAI FAMILY AND THERE'S A DROUGHT IN KENYA
YOU HAVE GROWN INTO A GORGEOUS WOMAN
THEY MAKE ME PRESENT
AND WHEN SHE GOT TO THE HOUSE SHE WAS GREETED
SO FOR YEARS AGNES WALKED THROUGH THE RIFT VALLEY
WE SELL THEM WE KILL THEM AS EMBRYOS WE ENSLAVE THEM WE RAPE THEM
I LOVE THAT I DO NOT TAKE THINGS LIGHTLY
I CAN'T STAND IT
AND I HAVE TO NOW SHARE A FEW STORIES OF GIRLS I'VE SEEN ACROSS THE PLANET WHO
WHERE WE HAVE NOW COME TO LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE THE MOST EXTREME FORMS OF VIOLENCE THE
AND I WANT TO SAY WE'VE ANNIHILATED IT IN MEN AS WELL AS IN WOMEN
I ACTUALLY REALIZED ONCE IN KOSOVO WHEN I WATCHED A MAN BREAK DOWN THAT BULLETS ARE ACTUALLY
MY BROTHERS GET EVERYTHING
I AM AN EMOTIONAL CREATURE
IT WAS AN INVISIBLE LIFE HEADING FOR A NAMELESS GRAVE
I CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY THE PEOPLE SMUGGLERS TO HELP ME WITH THE CROSSING TO BRITAIN BUT I WILL GO BUY A WETSUIT AND I WILL SWIM
FOR EXAMPLE IT WAS NOT ONLY STUDENTS BUT ALSO TEACHERS WHO DID NOT FEEL MOTIVATED
I SAT IT ON THE BAR AND I ORDERED A SCOTCH AND THAT GOLDFISH WAS THE BEST WINGMAN
THE STUDY FOUND STRONG SUPPORT FOR GROWING BODY OF RESEARCH THAT HAS LINKED SOCIAL TIES WITH LONGEVITY
THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT I REALIZED THE RIPPLE EFFECT OF THE PROJECT
PROPS ARE ALSO REALLY GOOD AT PROVIDING AN ENTRY POINT FOR CONVERSATION
PEOPLE COULD NOT HELP THEMSELVES THEY HAD TO COME UP AND TALK TO ME
BUT NOW IMAGINE YOU'RE ON AN ISLAND WITH FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE
AND AS TIME GOES ON RELATIONSHIPS OR CONNECTIONS BECOME MORE IMPORTANT
I LANDED A DREAM JOB I FOUND A GREAT APARTMENT
YOU NOW HAVE FOUR HUNDRED DATA POINTS
THE FRIEND A DAY PROJECT CAUSED ME TO DO THINGS I'VE NEVER WOULD HAVE DONE OTHERWISE
I SPENT A COUPLE OF HOURS JUST LISTENING TO BRETT AS HE TOLD ONE HORRIFIC STORY AFTER ANOTHER
AND WITH EACH STORY I COULD TELL THAT HE WAS GETTING LIGHTER AND I WAS GETTING HEAVIER WITH THIS EMOTIONAL
I ONCE BROUGHT A GOLDFISH OUT WITH ME
LIFE WAS REALLY STARTING TO TURN AROUND
BUT ABOUT A MONTH INTO THIS NEW LIFE I REALIZED SOMETHING WAS MISSING
I HAD TO KEEP GOING
I'M A VERY SERIOUS POSSIBILIST
IT CAN BE DONE
AND WHEN IT OCCURRED I WAS THE ONLY DOCTOR ON THE MOUNTAIN
HOWEVER TO THE PURISTS TO THOSE WHO ARE OF FAITH THEY WILL TELL YOU
LAST YEAR I WAS VERY SHOCKED WHEN I WENT TO A DEBATE ON WOMEN'S DAY
AND THIS IS SOMETHING I WOULD LIKE TO DRAW ATTENTION TO AGAIN TO OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM
WHY IS THIS SO
IN FACT JULIUS NYERERE HIMSELF HAD BEEN A GREAT ADVOCATE FOR SCIENCE WHEN HE SAID THAT SCIENCE
NOW WHETHER YOU CALL IT RELIGIOSITY WHETHER YOU CALL THIS GREAT SPIRIT BY ANY NAME BRAHMA
AND YOU'D BE SHOCKED THAT HARDLY ANYONE KNEW THAT ADA LOVELACE WAS THERE BEHIND COMPUTER
WE NEED TO BUILD HER SELF CONFIDENCE FROM A VERY EARLY AGE BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WE ALSO NEED TO
AND THIS IS WHERE A GREAT DEAL OF EFFORT HAS TO BE DONE TO ACTUALLY MOTIVATE THEM FROM A VERY YOUNG AGE
YESTERDAY I WAS LISTENING TO ONE OF THE TALKS IT WAS THE TALK ABOUT THE NEED FOR AFRICA TO TURN INTO A
IF YOU WANT TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT AFRICA BECOMING A KNOWLEDGE CONTINENT
I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE PAGES OF THEIR BOOK AND SEE
THEY HAD A SURVEY AND THEY WERE ASKING THESE GIRLS HOW MANY WOMEN INVENTORS WE HAVE HOW
WE HAVE TO DO AWAY WITH THIS ROTE LEARNING
WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT WE DRIVE THIS CURIOSITY IN THE CHILD AND THEY NEED TO BE CURIOUS
SO THE GOAL I'VE GIVEN MYSELF IS OK I'M LEADING MY THIRD LIFE BECAUSE I'VE BEEN AN ACADEMIC I'VE BEEN AN
I'M STILL AMAZED AT THE PERFECTION WITH WHICH THE ENTIRE ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONS TOGETHER
NOW TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION DID I HAVE ANY AMBITIONS IN POLITICS
AND THIS WAS A TIME WHEN THEY WERE HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE
WE'VE SEEN THAT FOR EXAMPLE AFRICA MUST BE FOOD SECURE AFRICA MUST BE ENERGY SECURE AFRICA MUST BE
THERE'S NO MAGIC BUTTON
PUT YOUR HAND UP
AFTER SIX OR SEVEN I'M LIKE
I CAN I'M CONFIDENT
ABOUT ALL THE THINGS THAT MAKE ME WHO I AM
REALLY NOT TRUE
HEY THIS PLANE IS GOING DOWN WHO CAN FLY
LET'S FIND THESE COMPLEX PROBLEMS
DON'T BE SCARED OF THEM
I'D LIKE TO OFFER A RADICAL THEORY OF CHANGE BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE WORKING AROUND THE WORLD WITH PEOPLE TRYING TO SOLVE OUR
YOU'LL PROBABLY RECOGNIZE YOURSELF IN MORE THAN ONE
THAT IS A POINT TO POINT REPLACEMENT OF COORDINATION WITH PLANNING
AND I USE THAT WORD ADVISEDLY
TO SAY INSTEAD OF WE MUST MAKE AN ADVANCE PLAN WE MUST HAVE A FIVE YEAR PROJECTION OF WHERE THE WIKIPEDIA IS GOING TO
A SUPPORT GROUP IS SIMPLY A SMALL GROUP THAT WANTS TO MAINTAIN A WAY OF LIVING IN THE CONTEXT OF A
YOU LOSE THE RIGHT TO SHAPE PEOPLE'S WORK WHEN IT'S VOLUNTEER EFFORT BUT YOU ALSO SHED THE INSTITUTIONAL
WE'RE NOW ABLE TO DO THAT KIND OF THING WITH GROUPS
HOW WILL THEY SHARE IDEAS AND OPINIONS
I THINK THAT THIS IS A REALLY PROFOUND CHANGE IN THE WAY HUMAN AFFAIRS ARE ARRANGED
THE FACT THAT A SINGLE PROGRAMMER CAN WITHOUT HAVING TO MOVE INTO A PROFESSIONAL RELATION TO AN
AND THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN ONE ARENA AT A TIME ONE INSTITUTION AT A TIME
WEB LOGGING IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF MASS AMATEURIZATION
YOU FOUND SOMETHING
IT'S TAKEN OVER A WIDER GEOGRAPHIC AREA
YOU RAISE SOME RESOURCES
IT CAN BE FOR PROFIT OR NOT PROFIT
I'M GOING TO ILLUSTRATE IT WITH SOME FAIRLY CONCRETE EXAMPLES BUT ALWAYS POINTING TO THE BROADER THEMES
HOW DO YOU ORGANIZE A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS SO THAT THE OUTPUT OF THE GROUP IS SOMETHING COHERENT AND OF LASTING
BUT THE POINT IS THAT IT'S GOING TO BE A MASSIVE READJUSTMENT
I HAD TO LEARN TO SIT WITH THE PAIN OF MY THOUGHTS
I BELIEVED ALL THE NEGATIVE THINGS THAT PEOPLE TOLD ME
I STOPPED WAITING FOR PEOPLE IN MY LIFE TO GIVE ME THAT ATTENTION AFFECTION APPRECIATION AND
MY SHRINK SAYS I'VE GOT MARIJUANA PSYCHOSIS
I WAS BULLIED SO MUCH THAT I BEGAN BULLYING MYSELF TO THE EXTENT I FIRST
I WAS TAKEN AWAY BY THE POLICE 18 MONTHS LATER
THIS IS A PULSE OF LIGHT THAT'S ONLY ABOUT ONE WAVELENGTH OF LIGHT LONG SO IT'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF PHOTONS ALL
NOW IN OUR COMPANY THIS IS WHAT WE CALL THE PINKY SUCK MOMENT
WE HAVE FOUND THE MILLER'S CHILD WAS THE MESSAGE
AND I SAID SOMETHING SO AWESOME AND GREAT
ALL HE WANTED WAS A MOM ALL I WANTED WAS A CHILD
MY LOVE HAS GROWN BUT IS MY LOVE THAT GREAT
AND ISN'T THAT WHAT WE WANT TO SEE
YOU WILL FIND PEACE
A FATHER SHARED HIS JOURNEY WITH HIS DAUGHTER ABOUT HIS EXPERIENCE IN HOW HE'D NEVER THOUGHT HE'D BE ABLE TO GET IT BUT
I KNOW IT FEELS HARD RIGHT NOW BUT YOU WILL GET STRONGER
AND BECAUSE OF FAMILY BREAKDOWN LGBT HOMELESSNESS IN YOUTH IS AT A RECORD NUMBER BUT WE
BUT THE THING IS I DIDN'T GET HERE BY MYSELF AND I CERTAINLY DIDN'T GET HERE OVERNIGHT
WE NEED TO CREATE A SPACE TO TALK ABOUT THE THINGS IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT HAVEN'T BEEN SPOKEN ABOUT TO TALK ABOUT THE HOMOPHOBIC
WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THOSE THINGS THAT WE'RE AFRAID OF WE NEED TO CREATE A SPACE WHERE WE CAN BE WHOLE
HE WAS A FIRST CENTURY B
THEN SHE WENT BACK AND FORTH
YOU'RE ALL DONE
I GREW UP WITH A MOM WHO TAUGHT ME THIS DAY IN AND DAY OUT
AND I'M GOING TO BREAK IT DOWN FOR YOU FOR JUST A SECOND
I MEAN WHAT DOES SOMEBODY WITH ALL THESE OUTFITS BRING WITH HER
JUST BE WHO YOU ARE
AND IF YOU DON'T THINK YOU LOOK GOOD IN SOMETHING YOU'RE ALSO PROBABLY RIGHT
AND THAT NUMBER HASN'T REALLY CHANGED IN RECENT YEARS
THEY ARE MAKING LOTS OF DISTINCTIONS ALL THE TIME
IN FACT WE ARE NOT REALLY VERY GOOD LETTING THEM WALK TO SCHOOL ANYMORE BY THEMSELVES EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE FEWER
WHAT ABOUT THE POLITICAL SYSTEM
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU'RE A BAD BASKETBALL PLAYER
THE WHOLE COUNTRY WENT MAD
AND THEY ALL TELL YOU YES WE HAVE WON THE LOTTERY
BUT CHINA IS A SUPERSTAR IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH
COMPARING WITH A SUPERSTAR IS THE WRONG BENCHMARK
HOPEFULLY FIVE YEARS FROM NOW I'M GOING TO REPORT TO TEDGLOBAL THAT POLITICAL REFORMS WILL HAPPEN IN CHINA
IT'S VERY RARE AMONG COUNTRIES TO HAVE THIS KIND OF PATTERN
THE PICTURE THERE IS KHRUSHCHEV
AND WHICH ONE IS A DEMOCRACY
THAT'S BECAUSE THE TWO COUNTRIES HAVE ABOUT THE SAME POPULATION SIZE
YOU DON'T VACCINATE A FEW CHILDREN
OUR VAGINAS AREN'T CARS THAT WE CAN WALK AWAY FROM AND LEAVE
I DON'T WANT TO BE IMPRISONED BY IT AND THIS IS WHAT I THINK
THAT'S THE ONLY THING WE CAN SAY CAUSES RAPE
WE THE WOMEN HAVE TO PROTECT OURSELVES AGAINST THEM
AND I THINK THAT'S AN ACT OF TERRORISM AND I WILL NOT NEGOTIATE WITH TERRORISTS ON THOSE TERMS
IT'S MADE THEM REALIZE IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT
BOYS THINK THAT IT'S SO MUCH THEIR RIGHT TO TREAT A WOMAN'S BODY AS THEY PLEASE THAT NOT ONLY WOULD THEY
IN ALL OF THE TIME THAT I'VE BEEN WRITING AND WRITING ABOUT RAPE IN ALL THE EMAILS THAT I'VE GOTTEN
IT'S PEOPLE PREFERRING TO BELIEVE THAT THE WOMEN IN THEIR LIVES ARE POTENTIAL VICTIMS RATHER THAN ACCEPTING THAT THE
IT MEANS THAT WE TAKE UP LESS SPACE THAN WE'RE ENTITLED TO
BUT THE WORLD THAT PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT BECAUSE RAPE IS NOT NICE
THAT'S WHAT RAPE CULTURE LOOKS LIKE
WE LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE WOMEN ARE TAUGHT THEY DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO WALK DOWN THE STREET AT NIGHT BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE ACCESS
SO I DO NOT ENGAGE PEOPLE IN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHY WOMEN NEED TO PROTECT THEMSELVES OR
BECAUSE THE RESULT OF THAT IS THAT THEY ACTUALLY DO START TO CHANGE
AND THE WAY WE TALK ABOUT RAPE AS IF IT'S SOME KIND OF ARBITRARY THING THAT JUST HAPPENS TO WOMEN
AND I BELIEVE THAT TO FIX THE PROBLEM YOU HAVE TO NAME THE PROBLEM
BECAUSE WHAT IT DOES IS THAT IT FORCES US TO DIMINISH OURSELVES
I AM NOT SAYING THAT RAPE IS GOOD GIRLS I'M JUST SAYING CAN'T YOU JUST LEARN TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELVES
GIRLS WHEN WILL YOU LEARN THAT THE WORLD IS FULL OF EVIL MONSTERS AND YOU HAVE TO PROTECT YOURSELVES
I AM UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE FACT THAT BECAUSE OF THE WORK THAT I DO I STAND IN FRONT OF AN AUDIENCE LIKE THIS AND I AUTOMATICALLY THINK
AND THE RAPISTS WAS IN RED AND THE WHOLE VENN DIAGRAM WAS IN RED BECAUSE THE ONLY THING COMMON TO ALL EXPERIENCES OF RAPE
THEY'LL ACTUALLY DOCUMENT THE EVIDENCE AND PUT IT ON THE INTERNET FOR EVERYONE TO SEE WHAT A BIG MAN THEY ARE
IN REGARDS TO THE SEGMENT ON KERRIE ANNE'S SHOW THIS MORNING WHAT SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT WHEN SHE TALKED ABOUT
AND THAT IS HOW THINGS LIKE STEUBENVILLE OHIO HAPPENS
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ENGAGED IN THESE TOPICS BECAUSE SOCIETY ENABLES HIM TO NOT BE ENGAGED IN THEM
THAT IS HOW THINGS LIKE THE ROAST BUSTERS IN AUCKLAND HAPPENS
AND ONLY A HANDFUL OF THEM WILL EVER SEE JUSTICE PREVAIL
NOW THREE LIVES WASN'T THE BAD PART OF IT
I INVENTED THE FIRST WORLDWIDE JEWELRY INCLUDING THAT ANCHORING TECHNIQUE AND THAT
ALL THAT JUST WITH THE POWER OF OUR THOUGHTS ISN'T THAT GREAT
OFF COURSE I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT ANY NECESSARY THINGS I'M TRYING TO KEEP IT SERIOUS TODAY EVEN IS GOING TO BE A LITTLE DIFFICULT
BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT THE FEELING OF WINNING
JUST WHEN THINKING OF A LOVELY PERSON OR OF THE PROCESS ALL YOU GUYS LOVE I KNOW THAT
AND AND WHAT CAN WE DO TO KIND OF CHALLENGE THAT
AND THE MORE THE MORE THAT WE HAVE THOSE INTERACTIONS THE MORE IT DEVELOPS A KIND OF OF A VALUE OR AN EXPECTATION OF BEHAVIOR
AND I THINK PARKOUR DIRECTLY KIND OF CHALLENGES THAT
WE SORT OF MAKE THE RULES ON WHAT THESE THINGS MEAN
IT DOES HOWEVER CALL INTO QUESTION THE LINE THAT'S POSITED BETWEEN THOSE WHO
GOOD AND BAD CLEAN AND DIRTY ACCEPTABLE AND TABOO THERE EXISTS A GREAT DEAL OF OVERLAP BETWEEN AND IN FACT
WHY STUDY TROLLS
AFTER ALL EVEN INTERNET USERS WHO DON'T THINK THEY KNOW MUCH ABOUT TROLLING HAVE LIKELY ENCOUNTERED A WHOLE
IT CAN TAKE MANY FORMS FROM HARMLESS PRANKS ALL THE WAY TO BEHAVIORS THAT MEET THE LEGAL
I WANT TO BE A PART OF THIS
WE MARRIED THOSE IDEAS AND WE CREATED THIS MEYERHOFF SCHOLARS PROGRAM
WE NEED TO TALK TO HIM
SHE AND HER ADVISER HAVE A PATENT ON A SECOND USE OF VIAGRA FOR DIABETES PATIENTS
AND THEY DECIDED TO DO IT
AND SO WE REDESIGNED CHEMISTRY WE REDESIGNED PHYSICS
THAT'S A BIG DEAL
WHEN I WAS A 12 YEAR OLD CHILD IN THE JAIL IN BIRMINGHAM I KEPT THINKING I WONDER WHAT MY
HE RETOOK THE COURSE
AND I SAID TO MY PARENTS I'VE GOT TO GO
EVERY FOUNDATION MAKES THE DIFFERENCE IN THE NEXT LEVEL
AND THEY SAID ABSOLUTELY NOT
AND THE QUESTION IS THIS HOW IS IT THAT NOW WE LEAD THE COUNTRY IN PRODUCING AFRICAN AMERICANS
ROBERT MEYERHOFF SAID WHY IS IT THAT EVERYTHING I SEE ON TV ABOUT BLACK BOYS IF IT'S NOT ABOUT BASKETBALL IS NOT POSITIVE
AND WHAT WE LEARNED WAS THAT WE NEEDED TO THINK ABOUT REDESIGNING COURSES
S IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING AND M
GIVE ME A HAND FOR THAT
YOU'RE EXCITED ABOUT LEARNING AND YOU WANT TO ASK GOOD QUESTIONS
NUMBER ONE HIGH EXPECTATIONS
I HAD NO IDEA THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR THIS LITTLE BLACK BOY IN BIRMINGHAM TO
THEY WERE LOOKING AT THIS AMAZING PROTEIN DESIGN
IF YOU DON'T KNOW IT THERE'S BEEN A 79 PERCENT DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF WOMEN MAJORING IN
I'LL NEVER FORGET A FACULTY MEMBER CALLING THE STAFF AND SAYING I'VE GOT THIS YOUNG MAN IN CLASS A YOUNG BLACK GUY AND HE SEEMS LIKE HE'S
AND WHAT IS SIGNIFICANT ABOUT THE PROGRAM IS THAT WE LEARNED A NUMBER OF THINGS
IT SIMPLY MEANS THAT THEY BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT TO DO IT
AND AS A RESULT OF THAT EXPERIENCE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK WHILE I WAS THERE IN JAIL DR
WHAT WAS SIGNIFICANT WAS THAT THE FACULTY MEMBER WAS OBSERVING EVERY STUDENT TO UNDERSTAND WHO WAS REALLY INVOLVED
WE NEED TO FIND WAYS OF MAKING IT HAPPEN
SHE'S ON THE FACULTY TENURE TRACK IN PSYCHIATRY PH
I WANT TO GO
AND I LOOKED UP AND SAID WHO IS THAT MAN
AND THEY SAID HIS NAME WAS DR
HE'S NOT TAKING NOTES
MARTIN LUTHER KING
SO BUILDING COMMUNITY AMONG THOSE STUDENTS VERY IMPORTANT
AND THE NUMBER ONE REASON WE FIND QUITE FRANKLY IS THEY DID NOT DO WELL IN FIRST YEAR SCIENCE COURSES
IT WAS DIFFICULT TO FUNCTION NORMALLY AT HOME AND IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO GO BACK TO WORK
AT SOME POINT EACH ONE OF US WILL BE PROFOUNDLY AFFECTED BY ILLNESS BE IT IN
BUT IT WAS ALSO THE MOMENT WHEN I LEARNED MY NEXT LIFE GIVING LESSON FROM MY
I WAS WITH HIS FAMILY IN HIS FINAL MOMENTS BEFORE WE WITHDREW HIS LIFE SUPPORT
WHEN I SPEND AN ENTIRE 12 HOUR SHIFT WITH A PATIENT WHO JUST A FEW DAYS
BUT FOR THIS PATIENT HIS FAMILY AND FOR ALL OF US WHEN WE FIND OURSELVES IN THIS KIND OF
MARION CONTI O'HARE IS A NURSE RESEARCHER WHO DEVELOPED THIS PERSPECTIVE INTO A THEORY KNOWN AS THE
THERE ARE NO EXAMPLES
THAT WAS HOW MUCH EFFORT IT
WE WERE FAIRLY ALONE ON THIS JOURNEY FOR QUITE A WHILE
IT'S AN INCREDIBLE ACCOMPLISHMENT BUT IT'S ONLY THE FIRST STEP
IT TOOK DEDICATION
WE'RE NOT TALKING POLITICS TODAY
NO IT WASN'T
IT WAS A TOUGH DECISION
TO TYPE IT IN ITS ABBREVIATED FORM AND THEN ONLY ABOUT SIX LINES OF CODE IS THE TEST FOR
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BOOK I READ THE ARTS
THEY KEEP GOING ON FOREVER
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BREAKTHROUGH
I WAS TORN BETWEEN MATHEMATICS AND MEDIA
HE WENT ON AND ON AND CALCULATED 67 POWERS OF TWO
THERE WAS A TWEET ADAM HAVE YOU SEEN THE NEW LARGEST PRIME NUMBER
FRANK NELSON COLE DID NOT STOP THERE
THAT FILLS ME WITH ALMOST SEXUAL EXCITEMENT
WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT ROBOTS IN THIS TED
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A POLITICIAN
DS I'M AS DUMB AS A BOX OF HAMMERS
MY SKILL IS NOT IN THE MATHEMATICS
I WAS ASKED IN AN INTERVIEW LAST YEAR IN MY CAPACITY AS A LOWER CASE C CELEBRITY IN AUSTRALIA WHAT WAS YOUR
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOMETHING MY TWO GORGEOUS DAUGHTERS HAD DONE
IT TOOK FOCUS
SO SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS WE MADE AS TO WHAT WE MIGHT WANT TO DO AFTER LUNCH WERE A LITTLE BIT IMPRACTICAL AND AFTER A WHILE SOMEONE MADE A
I JUST POLITELY RAISED MY HAND AND WHEN MS
IT IS SUCH A THRILL FOR A HUMBLE BREAKFAST RADIO ANNOUNCER FROM SYDNEY AUSTRALIA TO BE HERE
THAT'S WHAT IS SO EXCITING FOR ME ABOUT THIS PRIME NUMBER
WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT WHAT THEY CAN AND CAN'T DO
WHERE WOULD YOU GO
WHERE YOU HAVE TO COMPARE THE BENEFITS AND COSTS OF DIFFERENT CITIES NOW YOU HAVE TO COMPARE THE REPUTATIONS OF
I THINK EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM WAS A CHILD AT SOME POINT
AND THIS IS TRUE FOR EMPLOYEE EMPLOYER RELATIONSHIP AS WELL
HOW WELL DO WE MAKE DECISIONS
BECAUSE IF IT SENDS AN IMAGE TO THE EARTH IT TAKES ABOUT 12 MINUTES ON
SO IT WOULD BE TOO LATE
AND BY THE WAY A REPORTER CALLED ME THE OTHER DAY AND HE SAID HE LOOKED ON WIKIPEDIA AND HE SAID HE SAW MY BIRTHDAY WAS AUGUST 22ND
AND I WANT TO LIVE EVERY DAY OF THE REST OF MY LIFE THAT WAY SWIM OR NO SWIM
SO THAT WAS AT EIGHT O'CLOCK AT NIGHT
AND THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF PROBLEMS
AND HE IS DOWN
I CAN FEEL PROUD
IF I GET STUNG I'LL JUST GRIN AND BEAR IT
SO I SWAM THROUGH THE NIGHT AND AT DAWN THEY GOT THERE AND THEY STARTED WITH PREDNISONE SHOTS
AND THIS TIME I DON'T LIKE IT I DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE INTO IT BUT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A NON STOP
THEY WERE PREPARED
AND WHEN I STARTED IN WITH THE EIGHT HOURS AND THE 10 HOURS AND THE 12 HOURS AND THE 14 HOURS AND THE 15
IT'S 14 HOURS 58 MINUTES
WHO CARES THE LAST TWO MINUTES
WE NEED ACTIVE SYSTEM
AND HOW DO WE DO THAT
EVERYBODY GOT ONE
AND I TOOK MY BASKET OF CHOCOLATES AND EVERY SINGLE PERSON I SAW THAT DAY I SAID TO THEM THE THING I
WORE SOMEBODY ELSE'S CLOTHES DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY
WE ARE GOING HERE WE ARE GOING TO TALK DIRECTLY TO THE SCIENTIST AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK TO OTHER PARENTS ABOUT WHAT HAS TO
AND SO BY THE TIME I WAS EIGHT I'D SCREWED UP MY COURAGE ENOUGH TO GO TO THE NUNS AND SAY THE THING THAT HAD BEEN IN MY HEART
WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT
THE STORY THE CATHOLIC CHURCH THE SON OF GOD THE MYSTERY THE RITUAL THE RITE THE INCENSE THE WHOLE THING LOVED IT ALL
WHEN WE TRY AND LIVE SOMEONE ELSE'S LIFE HAVE YOU EVER TRIED THAT
WHEN I WAS A EHM
I DON'T CARE
WE DON'T NECESSARILY MOVE FROM ALL OF THOSE VOICES WE CHOOSE THE ONES MOST WISELY OF COURSE THAT WE LIVE FROM AND
I KNOW ABOUT OBESITY I'M A MEDICAL DOCTOR BUT I ALSO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE HUMAN CONDITION AND I CAN UNDERSTAND
REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE SIX
AT LEAST IN BERKSHIRE COUNTY
AND THIS WOMAN IN HER MID 50S LATE 60S STOOD UP AND SAID FROM TORONTO STOOD UP AND SAID
WOULD YOU NOT
WHAT WAS RUMI TRYING TO TELL US
YOU HAVE A DUTY TO PERFORM
DO ANYTHING ELSE DO ANY NUMBER OF THINGS
YOU HAVE A DUTY TO PERFORM AND YET IF YOU DO NOT DO THIS ONE TASK YOUR TIME HERE WILL HAVE BEEN WASTED
WHEN WE ARE AUTHENTIC WE ARE FREED UP TO CREATE BECAUSE WE AREN'T DAMPED DOWN
THEY HADN'T WON A NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP SINCE 1975
BUT LOSING WEIGHT ALONE WILL NOT GET YOU ACROSS THE FINISH LINE WITH A WINNING TIME
DURING GAMES HE WOULD OFTEN ASK WHAT ARE YOU SEEING THAT I'M MISSING
TO ENABLE ITS PEOPLE TO TAKE THAT TRANSFORMATION FIRST OF ALL THEY INVESTED IN NEW TOOLS
THAT SOUNDS EXHAUSTING
AND SECOND HOW DO WE FIX IT
MOST TRANSFORMATIONS HAVE FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL GOALS
SO I SOON REALIZED THAT THEY WERE THINKING ABOUT THE ETHICS OF THE WORK BUT THE LAB DIDN'T CREATE A SPACE
THE FIVE OFFICIAL NUCLEAR POWERS HAVE NO PLANS TO ABOLISH THEIR NUCLEAR WEAPONS
PRESIDENT GEORGE H
THEY DIDN'T SAY WELL I REALLY WANTED TO DESIGN NUCLEAR WEAPONS
THIS RESULTED IN A COUPLE OF BOOKS
THERE'S A REAL DANGER IN THAT ABSTRACTION
THEY LOOK PRETTY AND PSYCHEDELIC LIKE THIS
I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH THREE THOUGHTS
NOW THEY'RE NOT EVEN TESTED UNDERGROUND
I INTERVIEWED A PROFESSOR AT A UNIVERSITY WHO TRAINED A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WENT ON TO WORK AT THE WEAPONS LABS
I ALSO MOVED INTO HOUSING THAT I SHARED WITH PEOPLE WHO WORKED AT THE LAB
OVER A COUPLE YEARS I LIVED IN THREE DIFFERENT HOMES WITH DIFFERENT PEOPLE WHO WORKED AT THE LAB
SO THEY WEREN'T POLITICAL IDEOLOGUES THEY DIDN'T DO THIS BECAUSE THEY FELT PASSIONATELY HOSTILE TO COMMUNISM
WHEN I LOOK BACK NOW I THINK THAT THAT WAS THE MOMENT THAT SET ME ON THE PATH WAS TO WRITING A BOOK CALLED YOUR
SINCE THAT TIME MR
AND SHE SAID I KNOW THAT BUT I CAME TO YOUR FESTIVAL WITH MY MOTHER WHEN I WAS THEIR AGE AND I
THEY'RE NOT CONSERVATIVE OR TRADITIONAL APPROACHES
AS FAIZAN SAID AT THE TIME IF WE BOW DOWN TO THE ISLAMISTS WE'LL JUST BE SITTING IN A DARK CORNER
IN FACT AMEL'S SISTER LAMIA OVERCAME HER GRIEF WENT TO LAW SCHOOL AND PRACTICES AS A LAWYER IN
FAR AWAY IN THE AMERICAN MIDWEST I HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE OF MEETING SOMALI AMERICANS WHO WERE WORKING TO COUNTER THE
AN AFGHAN PROSECUTOR HAS BEEN ASSASSINATED
YOU AND FATHER MUST KEEP YOUR HEADS HELD HIGH
WE HAVE TO BE HERE
AND IT IS SIMPLY THAT FOR HER A BETTER FUTURE FOR ALL THE MARIA BASHIRS TO COME IS WORTH THE
THEY'RE MOST OFTEN ABOUT CHANGING PEOPLE'S RELATIONSHIP WITH ISLAM RATHER THAN PRESERVING IT
SOME USE AND ADVOCATE VIOLENCE
SOME DO NOT THOUGH THEY'RE OFTEN INTERRELATED
BUT IN ANY CASE THESE ARE ALL RADICAL PROJECTS
IT WAS AN ADIDAS MARKETING CAMPAIGN BACK IN 2014 CALLED THE IMPOSSIBLE
NOT ONLY THAT WE'VE CHANGED THE WAY WE DO THINGS
SO HOW DID WE GET THERE
NOW WE SPEND MOST OF OUR TIME IN WHAT WE CALL THE ART OF ATTENDING
SO THAT BRINGS US TO 2014 AND WHY WAS 2014 IMPORTANT TO ME
NOW HERE'S WHAT MARCUS WELBY WAS
SO WE TOOK SOME OF THE BEST PEOPLE DOING MATHEMATICAL MODELING AND CREATED A PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS AND MATHEMATICAL MODELING
SO AT JEFFERSON FOR EXAMPLE IN 2014 WE STARTED THE CENTER FOR HEALTHCARE ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND SCIENTIFIC SOLUTIONS
WE MEASURE INDIVIDUALS' PROFESSIONAL AND PERSONAL HAPPINESS AT VARYING INTERVALS AFTER GRADUATION
FOR THOSE OF YOU FROM THE 2010S IT'S SORT OF LIKE A RED BOX FOR YOUR DNA
SO THE BIG TIP TELEVISION SHOW IN THE 70S WAS MARCUS WELBY
I'D LIKE TO
AND NOW WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE CAN TAKE THINGS FROM OTHER INDUSTRIES
WHAT DID THAT DO FOR US OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS
THIS TIME THOUGH THE INSURERS AND GOVERNMENT SAID
I'M STEVE KLASKO
WELL AMAZINGLY THE DOCS SAID NO
AND THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN
BECAUSE AFTER ALL THAT'S WHY THEY CAME TO OUR UNIVERSITY
DOESN'T THAT SOUND LIKE EVERY DRUG YOU HAVE EVER HEARD OF
HOW MANY TIMES DO I ACTUALLY CHECK LIKES
BUT I DON'T
WHY AM I JUST SITTING HERE IN MY PJ'S WATCHING NETFLIX
HEARING WHAT I'VE SAID TODAY MIGHT MAKE YOU THINK I WANT YOU TO GET OFF OF IT
WE ARE TAUGHT TO RESPECT OTHERS AND TREAT THEM HOW THEY DESERVE
DID THAT FACEBOOK SCROLL MAKE ME FEEL BETTER OR WORSE OFF
THAT DARK SIDE THAT LOOKS AT A PICTURE OF A HAPPY FAMILY AND WONDERS WHY YOURS DOES NOT LOOK LIKE THAT
IT'S JUST ONE PHOTO IT'S FUNNY
I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING ANYWHERE SO I'M NOT GOING TO WASTE MY TIME TELLING YOU TO SPEND LESS TIME ON
IT'S JUST THE MOST RECENT TOOL WE USE TO DO WHAT WE HAVE ALWAYS DONE
WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THESE EVERYDAY INSTANCES AS WELL
I WAS DISTRACTED IN CONVERSATION
I WAS SEEING THESE GORGEOUS SIGHTS JASPER HAD TO OFFER AND MY FIRST REACTION WAS TO TAKE OUT MY PHONE AND POST IT ON
ANYTHING WE DO THIS OFTEN IS WORTHY OF CRITICAL OBSERVATION
BUT I'D LIKE TO PUT THE NEXT 15 MINUTES OR SO INTO PERSPECTIVE FOR YOU AND I'M GOING TO NEED YOUR HELP FOR THAT
ONE IS BASIC HUMAN OBSERVATION SOMETHING WE ALL SHARE
SERIOUSLY CITIES AROUND THE WORLD CAN'T PUT IN A SIMPLE DECENT CYCLE TRACK OR WIDEN THE SIDEWALKS TRAFFIC CALM A
PHYSIO SOCIO PSHYCO IDEAL PLEASURE IN EVERYTHING THEY DO
SIMPLE RATIONAL LOGICAL
FIRSTLY WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE STREETS THEMSELVES
AS WE SPEAK THERE ARE CITIES IN THE NETHERLANDS WHO ARE INSTALLING RAIN SENSORS ON THEIR BICYCLE TRAFFIC LIGHTS SO THAT WHEN IT RAINS
NOW A LOT OF PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE THIS PERCEPTION THAT STREETS ARE THE EXCLUSIVE DOMAIN OF AUTOMOBILES
IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW HILLY HOW HOT HOW COLD CITIZEN CYCLISTS WILL RIDE SEDUCED BY THE GOOD DESIGN THE
I THINK THERE'S A PRETTY GOOD CHANCE IT'S GOING TO WORK AGAIN
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT IT WORKED FOR ABOUT 7000 YEARS
GOOD DESIGN CAN ALSO IMPROVE HUMAN BEHAVIOR
IN COPENHAGEN IN THE MORNING RUSH HOUR WHEN A COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE RIDE THEIR BIKES TO WORK IT'S DIFFERENT
THE GLASS ROOFS WERE A FUNNY IDEA BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT'S HOW DESIGNING CITIES FOR PEOPLE SHOULD BE
IT'S THE PEOPLE WHO DEFINE THE CITY
SHOULDN'T WE STUDY THEIR BEHAVIOR THEIR PATTERNS THEIR MOVEMENTS THEIR DESIRES THEIR NEEDS IN ORDER TO FIGURE
LULU SOPHIA HAS A BROTHER HIS NAME'S FELIX HE'S 10
WHAT ARE STREETS
A DESIGNER THINKS ABOUT THE END USER OF THE PRODUCT
THAT HUMAN BEING ON THE OTHER END OF THE DESIGN PROCESS IS EVERYTHING
WHY ARE CARS SILLY
AND BY VALUES HERE I DON'T MEAN TOUCHY FEELY GOODY GOODY VALUES
MOST OF WHAT WE WRITE ABOUT IS HUMAN BEINGS DOING THINGS AND OTHER PEOPLE GETTING UPSET ABOUT IT
THEY ONLY TALK ABOUT KINGS AND PRINCES AND ELITE WHITE MALE PEOPLE DOING STUFF
SOMEONE MIGHT SWITCH ME OFF
LET'S SEE HOW THAT APPLIES TO THIS QUESTION OF CAN YOU SWITCH THE MACHINE OFF
STUART CAN I JUST SAY I REALLY REALLY HOPE YOU FIGURE THIS OUT FOR US
WELL IT REASONS IN A DIFFERENT WAY
IN FACT IT'LL JUST HELP YOU SEND YOUR KIDS TO SCHOOL
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT TALK
THAT WOULD BE A TERRIBLE IDEA
I SNEAK DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND TAKE STUFF FROM THE FRIDGE
AND THERE ARE MANY MANY DIFFICULTIES INVOLVED IN DOING THIS I DON'T EXPECT THAT THIS IS GOING TO GET SOLVED VERY QUICKLY
I WILL DISABLE MY OFF' SWITCH
SO IS THAT A GOOD THING
SO IF WE THINK ABOUT THIS PROBLEM THE PROBLEM OF CREATING SOMETHING MORE INTELLIGENT THAN YOUR OWN SPECIES WE
WHAT EXACTLY IS THE PROBLEM
THE THING THAT'S TOTALLY AMAZING THE REASON I'M ON THIS STAGE IS BECAUSE WHAT THAT TELLS US IS SOMETHING DEEP ABOUT THE
FOR GOOD REASONS WE THOUGHT WE'D NEVER SEE KILLER EVIDENCE AND THIS IS KILLER EVIDENCE
BUT IT'S NOT EXACTLY 2
IT'S ONLY 2
THOSE GRAVITATIONAL WAVES IN THE STRUCTURE OF SPACE ARE TOTALLY INVISIBLE FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES
THINK ABOUT THAT
WHY AREN'T WE CHANGING THE BEHAVIOR IN THE ACTUAL CYBERBULLY
I'M A GLOBAL FINALIST
WOULD THEY STILL BE AS WILLING TO DO IT
WE'RE TALKING 1
THE NUMBER DIDN'T SURPRISE ME
OUR BRAINS ARE KIND OF WEIRD
I WAS GREEDY
ME WAS A FLOATING HEAD
IF I WAS TIRED I DRANK MORE ESPRESSOS
IT WAS MY HEAD THAT WAS BALD AND COMFORTABLE NOW WITHOUT A HAT
IT HAD NO LIMITS
I KNOW THAT THE ABSCESS THAT GREW AROUND MY WOUND AFTER THE OPERATION THE
I TOOK MORE THAN MY BODY HAD TO OFFER
AND SHE SANG I MEAN HER WHOLE BODY SANG
MY BODY WAS OFTEN IN THE WAY
I HEARD STORIES THAT GOT INSIDE MY BODY
AND THE OTHER WOMEN SANG AND THEY PRAYED FOR ME AND MY MOTHER
IT WAS THE CONTINUING DEVASTATING WAR IN THE CONGO AND THE INDIFFERENCE OF THE WORLD
IT WAS ALL THESE THINGS
AND I SAID BUT WHAT'S THE WATER PART
IF I WAS AFRAID I WENT TO MORE DANGEROUS PLACES
OH SURE SURE I HAD MOMENTS OF APPRECIATION OF MY BODY THE WAY AN ABUSIVE PARENT CAN SOMETIMES HAVE A MOMENT OF
IT WAS A THOUSAND HALLELUJAHS AND A MILLION OMS
IT WAS INVINCIBLE
IT WAS A WAY OF LOCATING MYSELF
I WORRIED THAT IF I TOOK MY HAT OFF I WOULDN'T BE HERE ANYMORE
I BEGAN TO SEE MY BODY LIKE AN IPAD OR A CAR
IT WAS THE REALIZATION THAT I HAD COME VERY CLOSE TO DYING IN THE SAME WAY THAT
WHAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING I CAN DO TODAY
A COUPLE OF YEARS AFTER THAT KEVIN ADOPTED ME AND I CHANGE MY LAST NAME FROM RORY MACLACHLAN TO RORY VADEN AND THEY
I HAD BEEN STUDYING MARTIAL ARTS SINCE I WAS 5
WAITING TO DO SOMETHING BECAUSE WE'RE DECIDING THAT NOW IS NOT THE RIGHT TIME THAT ISN'T PROCRASTINATION
I FEEL LIKE IT WAS PRETTY MUCH SINGLE HANDEDLY USHERED IN BY THE LATE GREAT DR
BUT A MULTIPLIER REALIZES THAT IF I SAVE 30 MINUTES A MONTH FROM PAYING MY BILLS BY SETTING UP ONLINE BILL
IT'S WHY SOME PEOPLE CREATE EXTRAORDINARY EXPLOSIVE EXPONENTIAL RESULTS AND OTHER PEOPLE
YOU MULTIPLY TIME BY GIVING YOURSELF THE EMOTIONAL PERMISSION TO SPEND TIME ON THINGS TODAY THAT CREATE MORE TIME TOMORROW
SOON KEVIN CAME OVER ON THE WEEKENDS AND WE WOULD PRACTICE OUR FORMS
PROCRASTINATION IS THE FOUNDATION OF ALL MEDIOCRITY
LIKE CHECKING EMAIL 24 HOURS A DAY 7 DAYS A WEEK
WELL RORY WAIT A MINUTE IN THE TAKE THE STAIRS BOOK YOU SAID
HOWEVER IF YOU ASK THE QUESTION
ANOTHER GENTLEMAN WHO WALKED IN IT WAS HIS FIRST DAY ALSO
WE ADVANCED THROUGH THE BELT LEVELS TOGETHER AND SO KEVIN STARTED BRINGING ME HOME FROM CLASS EVERY ONCE IN
OR SOMEONE RISES UP TO THE CALL OF LEADERSHIP
HOW DOES IT FEEL TO KNOW THAT REALLY ALL WE ARE IS A BUNCH OF JUGGLING HAMSTERS SPRINTING TOWARDS AN INEVITABLE CRASH
NO WORK DADDY
WHAT I REALIZED IN THAT MOMENT FROM A 2 YEAR OLD IS THAT TODAY TIME MANAGEMENT IS NO LONGER JUST
SO THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS TIME MANAGEMENT
AND WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT IF SOMETHING CAN CONTINUALLY WAIT OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU DEVELOP THE COURAGE TO DO WHAT YOU
AND THAT'S GOING TO POSE AN ENORMOUS PROBLEM
DON'T TREAT SOMEONE LIKE THAT
I CAN DO IT IT'S FINE
CAN I JOIN IN
I'M TELLING YOU MY STORY TODAY BECAUSE I'D LIKE YOU TO GET INTO MY LIFE JUST FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES
AND THEY ONLY WENT OUT FOR A GOOD NIGHT NOT TO BE PERSECUTED FOR WHO THEY ARE
IT'S NOT FAIR THAT I HAVE TO WAKE UP AND FEEL LIKE THAT EACH DAY
NOW HOW YOU CAN HELP
AND IT'S LIKE MY SEXUALITY ISN'T UP FOR GRABS IT ISN'T UP TO CHANGE
AND THAT'S LIKE I SAID WHEN I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING IT'S A NATURAL STATE OF MIND OF CAUTIOUSNESS
WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THE TYPICAL TWO WOMEN AND THE POSTMAN COMES IN OR THE TWO WOMEN AND THE
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
BECAUSE IT MAKES ME OUT SOMETHING I'M NOT
AND ONE STUDY ACTUALLY PUT FIGURES ON THAT SO IT LOOKED AT CHILDREN GROWING UP IN PERSISTENT POVERTY AND HOW WELL THEY WERE
IN ONE STUDY SCIENTISTS LOOKED AT ABOUT 17000 CHILDREN WHO WERE BORN IN 1970
NOW AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THE ANSWERS AREN'T QUITE AS SIMPLE AS THAT
MANY CHILDREN IN THIS STUDY WERE BORN INTO POOR FAMILIES OR INTO WORKING CLASS FAMILIES THAT HAD CRAMPED
I'VE GOT THREE BOYS THEY'RE THREE NINE AND 12
LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF THAT
WELL WHAT IS A CURVATURE
OH YEAH NOW THAT'S GREAT
SO I TRIED I HAD TO SLOW DOWN THIS EXPONENTIAL GROWTH AND MAKE THIS RATIO CLOSER TO ONE
IF I WOULD BE IN A HYPERBOLIC PLANE I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO IT BECAUSE IF I WOULD TRY TO FOLD IT AND GET
AND THEN SHE SAID
CROCHET INSTRUCTIONS IN A MATH JOURNAL
IT'S THE BEST IF YOU CAN MAKE IT YOURSELF
HOW COULD I IMAGINE SOMETHING WHICH I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO IMAGINE
THIS LOOKS LIKE A CROCHET PATTERN
THE SAME NIGHT I STARTED TO CROCHET
I DON'T LIKE MY JOB
THE THINGS IS EVERYONE WAS IMPOSSIBLE UNTIL SOMEBODY DID IT
AND THE THING IS THAT NO ONE IS GOING TO DO THIS FOR US
AND ONE OF MY FRIENDS NOW HE HAS A FAMILY OF EIGHT AND HE SUPPORTS HIS WHOLE FAMILY
I'M GUESSING THIS ROOM IS DIFFERENT BUT THAT'S THE AVERAGE THAT DELOITTE HAS DONE WITH THEIR STUDIES
IN 1898 NORMAN TRIPLETT DID THIS STUDY WITH A BUNCH OF CYCLISTS AND HE WOULD MEASURE THEIR TIMES AROUND THE
BUT I WOULD HAVE TO WARN THEM BECAUSE AT THIS POINT MY QUIT RATE WAS ALSO 80 PERCENT
EITHER WE GIVE UP OR WE NEVER START IN THE FIRST PLACE
EITHER WAY WE START TO BELIEVE IT
I'M TERRIFIED OF DEEP DARK BLUE WATER
YOU ARE THE AVERAGE OF THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU SPEND THE MOST TIME WITH
MOST THINGS ARE TOTALLY OUT OF OUR HANDS
AND THAT'S ALREADY STARTING TO HAPPEN
EVERY INVENTION EVERY NEW THING IN THE WORLD PEOPLE THOUGHT WERE CRAZY AT FIRST
IT'S ALL ABOUT JUST BUILDING YOUR RESUME
YOU KNOW BEFORE THIS A PASSION COULD COME AND HIT YOU IN THE FACE OR MAYBE IN YOUR POSSIBLE LINE OF WORK YOU MIGHT THROW IT AWAY
I JUST HAD NO IDEA HE WAS GOING TO SWIM
THIS BLEW MY MIND
SO I WANTED TO FIND OUT WHAT IS IT THAT SETS THESE PEOPLE APART THE PEOPLE WHO DO THE PASSIONATE WORLD CHANGING WORK THAT WAKE UP INSPIRED
AND I HEARD THAT AND THAT WAS ALL I NEEDED
THAT'S HOW TOUGH IT WAS
WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE
I WANTED TO HAVE SOME TYPE OF IMPACT
AND THOSE PEOPLE HAVE MADE UP THAT COMMUNITY OF PASSIONATE FOLKS WHO INSPIRED THAT POSSIBILITY THAT I
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SINK
CHANGE THE WORK WEEK
I LOST ALL HOPE
I CRIED THE ENTIRE WAY HOME
MANY PEOPLE WHO CONTRACT POLIO IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME MEDICAL CARE
BY 4PM I HAD MADE IT TO MILE 94 AND I DID THE MATH AND I REALIZED
AND WITH HIS ENCOURAGEMENT AT AGE 34 I DECIDED TO GO AFTER KONA
THAT'S RIGHT IT'S A TOTAL DISTANCE OF 140
THERE WAS NO WAY I WAS GOING TO MAKE THAT SWIM IN MY TIME LIMIT OF 10 AND A HALF HOURS BECAUSE I WAS
WE NEED TO STOP EATING SO MUCH PROCESSED FOOD AND SUGAR
IT'S NOT JUST CANDY AND SWEETS AND SODAS
IT'S SAVORY THINGS IT'S UNEXPECTED ITEMS IT'S DRESSINGS IT'S BREAD PRODUCTS IT'S DAIRY PRODUCTS
NONE OF IT WAS PROCESSED
NONE OF IT WAS MANUFACTURED
AND THE MOST DETRIMENTAL ELEMENT OF THAT UNREAL FOOD THAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TODAY IS SUGAR
SO WE HAD TO THINK ABOUT IS THERE A MORE GENERAL WAY IN WHICH WE CAN START TO UNDERSTAND THE WORLD AND MAKE A VISUAL FIELD
AND PROJECT TANGO IS A PROJECT BY GOOGLE
BUT FAR FROM BEING INNATE THE RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT THESE DECISIONS AND THESE
THAT THEY CAN IMAGINE SUCCEEDING IN THOSE ROLES
THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO FEEL THAT THEY HAVE A POOR WORK LIFE BALANCE
I THINK THE FIRST OF THESE IS THAT WORK LIFE BALANCE IS NOT JUST ABOUT WOMEN
AND THAT THEY CAN BE CONFIDENT THAT THE SACRIFICES THAT THEY MAKE AND INDEED WE ALL MAKE WILL BE WORTH IT IN THE
AND THEY ARE LESS LIKELY TO MAKE SACRIFICES IN THEIR CAREERS
LONG HOURS NIGHT SHIFTS AND YOU DON'T GET ANYMORE UNPREDICTABLE HOURS THAN MIDWIFERY
WHO IS WILLING TO MAKE SACRIFICES FOR THEIR CAREER
SO IT SEEMS THAT MAYBE IT'S JUST QUITE SIMPLE WOMEN JUST DON'T MAKE THESE SACRIFICES
SO I DECIDED TO CHANGE THAT
I BELIEVE THAT EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO CREATE
THE MORE PEOPLE MEET THE MORE THEY DISCUSS THE MORE THEY CREATE
SO WHEN YOU SEE A WOMAN WITH BRAIDS OR LOCKS DRAPING DOWN HER BACK
THE METRO IN BRUSSELS NOT IN PARIS WERE SHUT DOWN FOR FIVE FULL DAYS
LET'S DO SOMETHING
I'VE BEEN IN PRISON ONLY ONCE IN MY LIFE BEFORE
THE MAYOR BOURGMESTRE WAS ASKED WHAT HE THOUGHT ABOUT IT
AND THEY ARE VERY FRUSTRATED
NO I DON'T LIKE IT
THREE DAYS AND NIGHTS LATER HE RETURNS TO THE BAR PRESENTS THE PLAY TO THE ACTRESS AND THE SEDUCTION
AND THE PROBLEM WITH THE MODERN WORLD AND WEBSITES TINDER AND APPS IS THAT IT'S KIND OF DOING AWAY WITH THE WHOLE
THEY ALWAYS TELL ME WHAT THEY WANT AND WHAT THEY'RE NOT GETTING
WELL LET'S LOOK AT BETWEEN THE LINES
THEN MAYBE AFTER A FEW DAYS OR WEEKS YOU MIGHT TRANSITION INTO THE MAINTENANCE PHASE WHICH IS A LONG TERM
WHAT DOES THE PLAY WITH NO WORDS WITH THE LETTER R SAY
AND THE ATTENTION INTEREST AND MAINTENANCE MODEL IS REALLY HELPFUL IN UNDERSTANDING THAT
I HAVE NO PERSONAL INTEREST IN THIS SUBJECT
LIFE IS A SEDUCTION EVEN LONG TERM MARRIAGES ARE A CONSTANT SEDUCTION
THEY MAY WANT A DATE THEY MAY WANT A FERRARI IN THEIR GARAGE OR THEY MAY WANT A MILLION POUNDS IN THEIR BANK ACCOUNT
SO IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO PLAY THE GAME OF LIFE THAT'S FINE BUT BE AWARE THAT YOU MIGHT RUN INTO TROUBLE IF
WHY IS THAT
I REALLY LIKE THIS RESTAURANT
THEN YOU GO OVER AND TALK TO THEM GET TO KNOW THEM AND YOU'RE ENTERING THE INTEREST PHASE
WE ALL KNOW PEOPLE WHO WE THINK
IT'S THE PLAY THAT'S SEXY
AND THAT CONSTANT CYCLING MEANS THAT LIFE AND EVEN LONG TERM COMMITTED RELATIONSHIPS ARE A LONG TERM
WHAT IT SAYS IS DON'T CHANGE A THING
HE SPENDS THE NEXT THREE DAYS AND NIGHTS WRITING A PLAY
IT'S KIND OF WHAT WE'RE SAYING TO A LOT OF PEOPLE A LOT OF THE TIME
AND THIS PLAY HAS A VERY SPECIAL FEATURE
SO FAR SO OBVIOUS
I FIND THAT MOST PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE RATHER LOW SELF ESTEEM WHEN IT COMES TO SEDUCTION
AND THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT HAVING AN IMPACT WHICH IS VERY SEDUCTIVE
WHAT THEIR EXPERIENCE OF YOU WAS THAT YOU WERE RATHER DIFFICULT IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE DATE AND THEN YOU WARMED UP TO THEM
AND THEY THINK THEY HAD AN IMPACT ON YOU
YOU SEE YOU CAN'T GO TO A PETROL STATION AND BUY A PLAY OFF THE SELF THAT HAS NO WORDS IN IT WITH THE
I SAID DARLING THE PUBLISHERS HAVE JUST RUNG ME UP AND THEY HAVE COMMISSIONED ME TO WRITE THE VERY NEXT BOOK THEY
BUT BECAUSE IT'S A BIG AND COMPLICATED SUBJECT I'M GOING TO FOCUS JUST ON ONE ASPECT IN THE SHORT TIME I'VE GOT TO TALK TO YOU
AND THAT ASPECT IS GOING TO BE
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT LEAVING YOU WANTING MORE IS A KIND OF SEDUCTION
IT HAS NO WORDS IN IT WITH THE LETTER R
I WAS WORKING IN THE OUTPATIENT DEPARTMENT AT MY PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL I WAS CONSULTING WITH A YOUNG LADY WHO WAS PRETTY
SHE CAN'T SAY WORDS PROPERLY THAT HAVE THE LETTER R IN THEM
THIS IS A WONDERFUL PERSON HOW COME THEY ARE SINGLE
SO I PACKED EVERYTHING IN THE BOX AND I PUT IT IN A CLOSET
SO I NEEDED TO SOLVE THAT BECAUSE GOING AND DOING LIKE FREELANCE FOR FULL TIME ONCE AGAIN I COULDN'T HAVE TIME TO DO
AND I REALIZED THAT PERSONAL PROJECT LETS YOU EXPRESS YOURSELF
HE'LL PROBABLY TELL YOU THAT IT'S THE ONE THAT HE'S WORKING ON RIGHT NOW AND IT'S NOT IN HIS PORTFOLIO
SO I STARTED THINKING WHAT CAN I MAKE
AND THESE ARE POINTS THAT DON'T RELATE ONLY TO DESIGN THEY RELATE TO ANYTHING
AND AFTER A FEW WEEKS FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE A WEEKEND PROJECT BUT ACTUALLY IT WASN'T
SECOND TIME I DIDN'T
WE WORKED WITH SOME FAMOUS MUSEUMS IN BAY AREA
BUT ACTUALLY WAS PROBABLY THE BEST YEAR OF MY LIFE BECAUSE I GOT TO DO SO MANY THINGS
AND IT WAS BASICALLY THE ONLY THING I WAS TALKING ABOUT TO ANYONE
I WOKE UP THINKING ABOUT THIS PROJECT
I GOT TO LEARN SO MANY NEW THINGS
I GOT TO PLAY
THE FIRST TIME I FAILED
THERE ARE NO COMPROMISES
SO IT SOUNDS LIKE A REALLY BIG SACRIFICE LIKE NO DINING OUT NO GOING OUT NO BUYING STUFF
SO I HAD THIS PROBLEM
I WENT TO BED THINKING ABOUT THIS PROJECT
WHAT'S SO POWERFUL ABOUT PERSONAL PROJECTS
IT HAPPENED TO ME
AND AT THAT POINT I JUST GAVE UP
I STARTED RECEIVING E MAILS LIKE CRAZY
AND AMONG THOSE E MAILS I RECEIVED SOME REALLY INTERESTING JOB OFFERS ALSO
AND THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE I HAD LIMITED EXPERIENCE
AND AFTER A FEW DAYS I REALIZED THAT MAYBE THE BEST THING TO MAKE IS A DIGITAL CLOCK BECAUSE THERE'S THIS NOTION AND FLOW OF
BUT EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM HAS A STORY
IT TOOK US 13 DAYS TO REACH THE CZECH REPUBLIC
SHE HAD TO STAY AT HOME
SHE COULDN'T GO OUTSIDE
EVEN THOUGH IT WAS NIGHT AND EVERYONE WAS TRYING TO CALM US DOWN WE COULDN'T STOP LAUGHING
WHAT WE NEED ARE PEOPLE WHO SEE THE VALUE IN INVESTING IN THESE TYPES OF LOCAL ENTERPRISES WHO WILL
THE SUM OF THE LOCAL IS THE GLOBAL
AND READING THAT BOOK MADE ME REEXAMINE THAT THEORY BECAUSE I NEED TO EXPLAIN WHAT I MEAN BY THAT
HAS ITS ISSUES
BUT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT L
IT'S NOT A COMPETITION WITH RURAL FARM IT'S ACTUALLY REINFORCEMENTS
THIS WAS BLASPHEMY
WE REALIZED THAT WE NEEDED SOMETHING THAT SCRAPED EVERY SURFACE OF ITSELF SO THAT ALL
WELL IT'S A LONG STORY BUT I'LL DO MY BEST TO TELL IT IN ABOUT 9
I STILL BELIEVE THAT BY THE WAY
AND I REALIZED
WHAT A POWERFUL MESSAGE TO THEIR CHILDREN
SOME PARENTS ASK ME WHAT IF WE SHARE ABOUT INTEGRITY AND THEN WE FAIL OR WE FALL
NINE YEARS AGO I CO FOUNDED A WOMEN'S ENTREPRENEUR ORGANIZATION IN PENANG TOGETHER WITH MY GOOD FRIEND
I BELIEVE SOMETHING POWERFUL HAPPENS WHEN WE PUT PEN TO PAPER
AND I'M JUST AMAZED AT THE OPENED DOORS
WE CAN HAVE SPEAKING ENGAGEMENTS CREATE WORKSHOPS
WHAT CAN WE DO
THERE WERE PAPERS EVERYWHERE
OUR CREATIVE TEAM CAME UP WITH THIS CONCEPT
AND I ALWAYS BELIEVE THAT WHEN WOMEN CAN HELP OTHER WOMEN IT IS SO EMPOWERING
AND THIS GIANT INFORMATION SYSTEM CAN BE SEARCHED IN MANY WAYS
THAT WILL NOT GUARANTEE THAT WE ACTUALLY CONVERGE TOWARD A SINGLE STORY OF VENICE
THIS IS PRETTY AMAZING
MAYBE WE CAN JUST SAY
NO IT'S NOT POSSIBLE
YOU HAVE EVERY BOAT THAT GOES OUT EVERY BOAT THAT COMES IN EVERY CHANGE THAT WAS MADE IN THE CITY
I THINK THE MAIN SHIFT IS THAT COMMUNITY WORK IS MORE
BUT THEY'RE NOT
I BELIEVE WE CAN CHANGE IT FOR THE BETTER
I HAVE TAKEN PART IN EXPEDITIONS THROUGHOUT THE BALTIC SEA
AND YOU NEVER KNOW YOUR BRONZE MIGHT JUST BE THE GOLD THAT YOU WERE SEARCHING FOR
WE ALSO SAW MOMENTS OF DISAPPOINTMENT ON THE PODIUM WHEN ATHLETES HAD COME SO CLOSE TO GOLD BUT
AND IF YOU ARE I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE EVEN OLYMPIC ATHLETES SPEND A LOT OF TIME OUT OF FIRST
I WON STUFF
MAN DID I LOVE IT
OVER THREE THESE DAYS
IT HAS FUSION OF VERTEBRAE IN THAT TAIL
IT'S A RATHER HORRIBLE DEBILITATING DISEASE AND IT LOOKS A LOT LIKE THE FUSION OF BONES AT THE END OF THE
CAN I FIX WHAT'S WRONG
THEY'VE TIED IT TO SOMETHING THAT THEY REALLY VALUE
LASTLY YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE IT EASY
SHE'S LOST 75 POUNDS ON THREE SEPARATE OCCASIONS
NO ONE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT WEIGHT LOSS MAINTENANCE NO ONE WANTS TO PREPARE FOR WEIGHT LOSS MAINTENANCE AND NO ONE IS GOING TO BUY OR USE A
SO IN COLORADO WE ALSO HAVE A GREAT MINDSET
AND WHEN SHE COMES IN SHE HOPES THAT WHEN SHE SPRINKLES IT ON HER FOOD TONIGHT SHE ACTUALLY WILL EAT A LITTLE
IT CREATES WHAT WE CALL A METABOLIC FLEXIBILITY AND IT REALLY ALLOWS YOU TO BE ABLE TO EAT AND MATCH WHAT YOU'RE BURNING
A VERY UNIQUE GROUP
WHAT I FOUND ACTUALLY CHANGED THE COURSE OF MY CAREER
THEY'VE TIED IT TO A HIGHER PURPOSE
THEY'VE DECIDED THAT THESE LIFESTYLES MEAN SO MUCH MORE
SO WHAT DID WE LEARN
AND PART OF THIS I THINK IS BECAUSE PEOPLE REALLY LIKE TO LOSE WEIGHT
THEY'RE THE ONES THAT NO ONE CAN DO THIS
BUT IT DOES
WHEN YOUR KIDS HANG AROUND PEOPLE THAT SMOKE GUESS WHAT HAPPENS
THEY ALL COME TO MY OFFICE AND THEY WANT TO KNOW WHY
I THOUGHT OKAY I'M GOING TO TAKE THIS
I WAS ABLE TO REALLY STUDY WHY THESE BEHAVIORS STICK IN THESE PEOPLE WHEN THEY DON'T STICK IN OTHER
AND IT'S YOUR BODY AND MIND
BUT IN COLORADO GUESS WHAT
I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT I LOVE IT
THE RELATIONSHIP WITH HER HUSBAND ISN'T WHAT IT SHOULD BE
AND SHE REALLY PAINTS A PICTURE OF SOMEONE THAT'S JUST GETTING BY SOMEONE THAT'S JUST DOING THE MINIMAL SOMEONE THAT JUST IS
IT CAN TOTALLY CHANGE OUR SOCIETY
MAINTAINING THE WEIGHT LOSS IS HARD
YOU LOOK WONDERFUL
HERE IS ONE OF HIS MESSAGES
WHAT IF I GIVE IT A SHOT
BUT JUST LIKE THE INNOVATIONS IN TECHNOLOGIES THAT STARTED IN GARAGES AND DORM ROOMS IN THE PAST MY PROJECT REALLY PICKED UP
YOU'RE ALSO PAYING FOR THEM TO BE CREATIVE
IT'S NOT A PERMANENT CONDITION
DEFINED BY YOUR STAMINA SO YOUR ABILITY TO RUN THE MARATHON NOT THE
THEY INSPIRED ME SO MUCH THAT I DECIDED TO PUT MY MONEY WHERE MY MOUTH IS
I WAS AT THIS POINT IN MY LIFE WHERE I HAD TO MAKE A DECISION
THANK GOD THEY DID THAT BECAUSE PIECE BY PIECE I STARTED GETTING A LITTLE BIT OF MYSELF BACK
SHE SPEAKS ABOUT GRIT
SO THAT INFORMATION COULD TELL ME IF THAT SHAMPOO IS GOOD FOR MY CURLY HAIR
SO IT MEANS THAT THE MOMENT WE DECIDE TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION WE'RE ABLE TO GET REALLY
SO FOR EXAMPLE WE ALREADY HAVE WATCHES WRISTBANDS CARS
IF YOU DON'T KNOW SAY THAT YOU DON'T KNOW
IT IS NEVER THE SAME
THERE'S THIS GREAT PIECE IN THE ATLANTIC
AND I DON'T MEAN JUST SET DOWN YOUR CELL PHONE OR YOUR TABLET OR YOUR CAR KEYS OR WHATEVER IS IN YOUR HAND
SO OUR MINDS ARE FILLING IN THOSE OTHER 275 WORDS
WE'VE HAD THEM BEFORE
ERR ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION
DON'T EQUATE YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH THEIRS
SHE WON A PULITZER PRIZE
IF YOU WANT TO STATE YOUR OPINION WITHOUT ANY OPPORTUNITY FOR RESPONSE OR ARGUMENT
WHAT THEY CARE ABOUT IS YOU
I CAME TO REALIZE
ONE MORE RULE NUMBER 10 AND IT'S THIS ONE
SOMEBODY ASKED STEPHEN HAWKING ONCE WHAT HIS IQ WAS AND HE SAID I HAVE NO IDEA
THE FAMED THERAPIST M
SO I WANT YOU TO FORGET ALL OF THAT
SO FORGET THE DETAILS
YOU NEED TO LET THEM COME AND LET THEM GO
WE GET DISTRACTED
BUT I STILL HAVE A GREAT CONVERSATION WITH THEM
NOW PEOPLE ON THE RADIO ESPECIALLY ON NPR ARE MUCH MORE AWARE THAT THEY'RE GOING ON THE RECORD AND SO THEY'RE MORE
AND HE GAVE HIS KIDS A COMMUNICATION PROJECT
AND MANY OF THEM ALMOST MOST OF THEM ARE MORE LIKELY TO TEXT THEIR FRIENDS THAN THEY ARE TO TALK TO THEM FACE TO
DON'T THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE FOR DINNER
ACCORDING TO PEW RESEARCH ABOUT A THIRD OF AMERICAN TEENAGERS SEND MORE THAN A HUNDRED
AND LOOK I KNOW IT TAKES EFFORT AND ENERGY TO ACTUALLY PAY ATTENTION TO SOMEONE BUT IF YOU
ALL EXPERIENCES ARE INDIVIDUAL
I CAN BOLSTER MY OWN IDENTITY
PEOPLE WHO BRAG ABOUT THEIR IQS ARE LOSERS
AND HE SAID THIS
NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS TRUCK DRIVERS BILLIONAIRES KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS HEADS OF STATE
DON'T THINK ABOUT YOUR ARGUMENT YOU HAD WITH YOUR BOSS
THEY'RE THE ONES THAT KNOW
I TALK TO SOME PEOPLE THAT I DISAGREE WITH DEEPLY ON A PERSONAL LEVEL
SCOTT PECK SAID THAT TRUE LISTENING REQUIRES A SETTING ASIDE OF ONESELF
THE KIND OF CONVERSATION WHERE YOU WALK AWAY FEELING ENGAGED AND INSPIRED OR WHERE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'VE MADE A REAL
STICK TO THE WEATHER AND YOUR HEALTH
STEPHEN COVEY SAID IT VERY BEAUTIFULLY
HE WAS THE MAYOR OF SACRAMENTO
THERE IS NO REASON WHY MOST OF YOUR INTERACTIONS CAN'T BE LIKE THAT
IT WAS WRITTEN BY A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER NAMED PAUL BARNWELL
LEAVE THEM OUT
BECAUSE THEN THEY MIGHT HAVE TO STOP FOR A MOMENT AND THINK ABOUT IT AND YOU'RE GOING TO GET A MUCH MORE
AGAIN THAT MEANS WE'RE NOT LISTENING TO EACH OTHER
A CONVERSATION REQUIRES A BALANCE BETWEEN TALKING AND LISTENING AND SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY WE LOST THAT BALANCE
THEY DON'T CARE
I MEAN BE PRESENT
I TALK TO PEOPLE THAT I DON'T LIKE
LEARN TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITHOUT WASTING YOUR TIME WITHOUT GETTING BORED AND PLEASE GOD WITHOUT
AND CALVIN COOLIDGE SAID NO MAN EVER LISTENED HIS WAY OUT OF A JOB
YES I WAS VERY ANGRY
PEW RESEARCH DID A STUDY OF 10000 AMERICAN ADULTS AND THEY FOUND THAT AT THIS MOMENT WE ARE MORE POLARIZED WE ARE MORE
BUT THERE'S ANOTHER REASON
WE'VE HEARD INTERVIEWS OFTEN IN WHICH A GUEST IS TALKING FOR SEVERAL MINUTES AND THEN THE HOST COMES BACK IN AND
AND WE DO THE EXACT SAME THING
I'M THE CENTER OF ATTENTION
LET THEM DESCRIBE IT
THAT MEANS THOUGHTS WILL COME INTO YOUR MIND AND YOU NEED TO LET THEM GO OUT OF YOUR MIND
SO I HAVE 10 BASIC RULES
WE'RE SITTING THERE HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH SOMEONE AND THEN WE REMEMBER THAT TIME THAT WE MET HUGH JACKMAN IN A COFFEE
WE KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY IT IS NOT ABOUT YOU
TRY ASKING THEM THINGS LIKE WHAT WAS THAT LIKE
I TALK TO PEOPLE THAT I LIKE
THAT'S A TON OF POWER
SO I'M REALLY EXCITED
IT'S STILL THERMALLY HOT BUT IT'S NOT RADIOACTIVE
IT'S A WAY TO BRING POWER TO THE DEVELOPING WORLD BECAUSE IT'S PRODUCED IN A FACTORY AND IT'S CHEAP
THAT'S SOMEONE WHO IS DESIGNING A HABITAT ON ANOTHER PLANET'S DREAM
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE MESSAGE WE SEND IS WHEN WE DO THAT
WE ARE SENDING THE MESSAGE HEY KID
ONCE UPON A TIME A CHILD CAME UPON A BUTTERFLY STRUGGLING TO EMERGE FROM ITS CHRYSALIS
CAN PEOPLE SHIFT BACK AND FORTH OR DO THEY GET STUCK IN ONE WAY OF THINKING ABOUT IT
WE TEND TO THINK RIGHT THAT MISERY LOVES COMPANY THAT VENTING WILL HELP GET RID OF OUR NEGATIVE EMOTIONS
WE CAN BE MORE AWARE THAT BAD TENDS TO STICK
YOU WILL EXPERIENCE DROUGHT
ATTITUDE MATTERS OK
ONE MORE ANALOGY TO THE STOCK MARKET
NOW WE CAN HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT OUR DIFFERING VALUES AND HOW WE SHOULD ADDRESS THIS BUT THE BASIC
WE CAN SEE THAT WITH GLOBALIZATION THE QUESTION WHERE ARE YOU FROM
A PROJECT OF THIS NATURE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT SOMEONE OF DELIA'S STATURE SPEARHEADING OUR EFFORTS
HENCE OUR GUIDING PRINCIPLE AND THEME FOR THE DAY
SO THANK YOU FOR THAT
A TRUE VISIONARY BY THE NAME OF DELIA COHEN INTRODUCED US TO THE TED PHILOSOPHY
A PHILOSOPHY ROOTED IN THE BELIEF THAT FREELY SHARED AND WORTHY IDEAS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CHANGE LIVES
I MEAN AT FIRST YOU THINK THESE PEOPLE ARE BAD THAT'S WHY THIS IS HAPPENING
THEY CAN ONLY BE PRODUCED BY SLAVED LABOUR
WHY ARE THEY SCARED
I DID THAT FOR YEARS
WE'VE DOCUMENTED CASES IN OVER 160 COUNTRIES ALL 50 US STATES OVER
WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT CHILD SEX TRAFFICKING WHAT WE'RE BASICALLY SEEING ARE REPEAT RUNAWAYS AND PRIOR VICTIMS OF
GO TO A TRUCK STOP LATE AT NIGHT OR A BUSY TRUCK STOP SIT DOWN IN A PARKING LOT STARE OUT AND WATCH THE PARKING
OR GO TO THE NAIL SALON
BABBLING THROUGH EVERY SILENCE IN THE CONVERSATION TALKING ABOUT THE WEATHER AND THE TERRAIN
IT IS NOT RE REWRITING HISTORY
AND THE SECOND TYPE OF FEEDBACK I GET IS
ARE YOU SAYING THAT I AM A RACIST
I REALLY APPRECIATED THE PERSPECTIVE YOU GAVE ABOUT STAYING FOCUSED ON WHAT YOU ARE CONVERSATION
BUT WHEN YOU ASK SOMEONE OR YOU RE ASKED LIKE WHAT S YOUR PASSION
IF YOU RE NOT PAID TO DO SOMETHING YOU RE NOT GOING TO BE THERE VERY LONG
AND HE WAS TAUGHT SPECIFICALLY
EXCEPT I KNEW I HAD A REASON TO GET UP IN THE MORNING GET SHOWERED LEAVE THE HOUSE PEOPLE WHO WERE WAITING FOR ME WHEN I GOT
IT S LIKE OH MY GOD I HAVE TO CAME OUT WITH A GOOD ANSWER FOR THIS
I MEAN HONESTLY MY EARRINGS COST 20
IT ALWAYS HAD
THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THIS WOW COMPELLING ANSWER
AND THAT YOUR LIFE ISN T WORTH LIVING
MY MOTHER BEGGED ME SHE SAID PLEASE TAKE A JOB ANY JOB
BOOKS COACHING WEBINARS WHATEVER
I TOLD HER WHAT I NEEDED THE DRESS FOR WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT AND SHE SAID OH MY GOSH I REALLY NEED TO HEAR THIS TALK BECAUSE I JUST
I M SUPPOSED TO PURSUE THIS PASSION
I MEAN I LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY
AND I HAD NO PASSION FOR JEWELRY
SHE S READY TO HIRE A TEAM OF PEOPLE
IT S JUST BUGGED ME
AND IF YOU DO THAT EVERYTHING WILL FALL INTO PLACE AND IF YOU DON T YOU FAILED
SHE SAID IT S LIKE TUPPERWARE BUT WITH BRACELETS
BECAUSE THE MOST FULFILLING RELATIONSHIPS THE MOST FULFILLING CAREERS ARE THOSE THAT STILL HAVE THE POWER TO
THE WOMAN WHO SOLD ME THIS DRESS
AND IT S NOT TRUE
ONE OF MY FAVOURITE COLUMNS IS A PIECE BY DILBERT CREATOR SCOTT ADAMS
YES I COULD DO THAT
HE WROTE A PIECE IN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL A FEW YEARS AGO ABOUT HOW WE FAILED HIS WAY TO SUCCESS
BUT THIS IDEA THAT I HAD TO KNOW WHAT I SUPPOSE TO DO NOW RIGHT
LOOK FOR PROBLEMS THAT NEED SOLVING
ONE OF MY FRIENDS IN HER MID FORTIES AND SHE S LOOKING WHAT S HER LIFE GOING TO BE NOW
AND SHE S LEGITIMATELY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS
ON THE DAY OF MY LAST SHOW I GOT ONTO THE ELEVATOR AT THE 36TH FLOOR AND AS IT STARTED TO DROP I
I LOVED THE JOB I REALLY DID
AT THE TIME I VE BEEN ALSO HOSTING A RADIO SHOW FOR THE MARTHA STEWART BRAND ON SIRIUS XM
IT IS THE FULL FORCE OF YOUR ATTENTION AND ENERGY THAT YOU GIVE TO WHATEVER IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU
AND THEIR HEARTS IN THE RIGHT PLACE IT S GREAT I M ALL ABOUT SELF DISCOVERY
I WAS SO AWKWARD AND AFRAID OF SELLING
BECAUSE IT PLANTED AN ENTREPRENEURIAL SEED I DIDN T KNOW WAS THERE
YOU KNOW WHY
THAT WHEN SOMEONE ASKS YOU AT A PARTY ON A DATE AT A JOB INTERVIEW WHAT ARE YOU
AND ONE OF HIS JOBS WAS A COMMERCIAL LOAN OFFICER
AND THAT BEARS FRUIT TO THIS DAY
AND THEN NOT LONG AFTER THAT GOT CANCELLED TOO
AND AS FOR THE THINGS YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO DO
THE PRESSURE STARTS REALLY YOUNG AND IT GOES YOUR WHOLE LIFE BUT IT S PERHAPS MOST PRONOUNCED WHEN YOU RE
BUT STILL FROM THE BACKGROUND RESEARCH I READ IN CONVERSATIONS I HAD WITH PROFESSIONALS WORKING WITH SIMILAR
MY WORK WAS OF THE CONCEPT CALLED ENERGY INDEPENDENCE
IF THEY HAD A SYSTEM WHERE THEY COULD COLLECTIVELY UTILIZE SOLAR AND OTHER RENEWABLE FORMS OF ENERGY AND STORE IT WITHIN
AND A WHOPPING 81 OF AMERICANS DO ACCORDING TO THE
THESE ARE CALLED REDOX FLOW BATTERIES
THIS WOULD GREATLY REDUCE OUR DEPENDENCY ON FOSSIL FUELS AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC COSTS
THERE ARE A VARIETY OF FREE ONLINE TOOLS THAT CAN HELP YOU GAUGE IF YOUR HOUSE AND ROOF
MOVING FROM A BIG PICTURE VISION TO A DOABLE RESEARCH PROJECT I WANTED TO STUDY HOW ENERGY STORAGE COULD BE
WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THESE NEXT GENERATION ENERGY SOURCES PEOPLE OFTEN LIKE TO PIT THEM AGAINST EACH OTHER IN A COMPETITION OF
BUT IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE TO USE PLANT MATTER THAT WE ARE ALREADY PRODUCING SUCH AS AGRICULTURAL
SO I DECIDED TO PUT IT TO USE BY MAKING IT INTO A PLANT BASED FUEL CALLED BIODIESEL WHICH CAN BE
AND THERE'S AN INFINITE WAY THAT YOU CAN DEFINE YOUR LIFE
THERE'S ACTUALLY 2 ON THAT SIDE 2 ON THIS SIDE
AND IT'S IN THOSE SPACES THAT WE RECLAIM CONTROL OF OUR LIVES
OF COURSE WELL HOW DO I DO 4
WE FIND WHAT WORKS AND THEN WE PROTECT IT WE DEFEND IT AGAINST EVERYTHING ELSE
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
I'VE HAD SOME AMAZING EXPERIENCES WITH AMAZING TEACHERS WHO OPENED MY EYES
RESULTS DOMINATE SCHOOLS AND SCHOOLS DOMINATE US THE
THAT IS CODE FOR UNEDUCATABLE
JUST LIKE THAT
IT KNOWS HOW MUCH IT'S MOVING
I ACTUALLY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT MY ROBOT IS GOING TO DO TODAY
SO IF WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE ROBOTS THAT CAN BE MORE EXPRESSIVE AND THAT CAN CONNECT BETTER WITH US IN SOCIETY
AND THEN THAT GOT ME THINKING
I BELIEVE THE YOUTH OF TODAY SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO OPPORTUNITIES LIKE THIS
WELL YOU KNOW YOU FAKED IT IT'S ALL FALSE IT'S NOT REAL
AFTER SHE WATCHED IT SHE CALLED HER DAUGHTER UP AND SAID HEY DON'T YOU WANT TO COME OVER AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS
AND WHY DID SO MANY WANT TO SHARE THEIR PERSONAL EXPERIENCES WITH ME
OFF SUSTAINABLE ARCHITECTURE TO PORTRAIT SCIENCE FICTION
WHY DO I HAVE TO KEEP LOSING ALL MY LOVED ONES
HOW COULD IT BE HURTING ME
IN FACT IT MIGHT EVEN MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER IN THE MOMENT
BUT YOU CAN'T DO THAT WHEN YOU'RE BUSY HOSTING YOUR OWN PITY PARTY
DO YOU INVEST EVERYTHING THAT YOU HAVE ALL OF YOUR MONEY POTENTIALLY GOING EVEN FURTHER INTO DEBT INTO AN INVESTMENT IN
WHY IS THIS SUCH A COMPLEX PROBLEM
WHY IS THAT
AFRICA IS THE LARGEST ARABLE LAND MASS ON THE PLANET
A LACK OF PROGRESS IN THIS AREA HAS NOT BEEN FOR A LACK OF TRYING
I'M SURE YOU'RE GUESSING WHERE I'M GOING NOW
I WANT SOMEONE TO LOVE ME AND MAKE ME FEEL SPECIAL
I ASKED HER WHY DO YOU THINK PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY NEED A RELATIONSHIP TO BE HAPPY
YOU CAN BE IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH ANYONE BUT IT DOESN'T ALWAYS MEAN THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE YOU HAPPY
BECAUSE HIS THEORY WAS
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM
AND LET ME TELL YOU WHY
WHERE IS ALL OF THIS MONEY GOING
SO THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT STUDENTS FIRST AIMS TO TRY TO DO IS BALANCE THAT EQUATION OUT AND MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE
AND THE WHOLE IDEA BEHIND STUDENTS FIRST IS A SIMPLE ONE AND IT IS THAT
IS THAT REALLY RIGHT
NOW SKIPPING SEEMS SO EASY
BUT I PROMISE YOU THAT YOU WILL LOOK BACK ON YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND REALIZE THAT THESE HAD IMPACTED YOU
FROM A YOUNG AGE I WAS TAUGHT THAT TO SUCCEED IN LIFE YOU HAVE TO FIND SOMETHING YOU LOVE AND FOLLOW THAT DREAM
AFTER HOURS OF PRACTICING AROUND MY HOUSE I FINALLY MASTERED THE ART OF SKIPPING
GREAT BUT HOW DOES THIS AFFECT ALL OF YOU
NOW THIS MAY MEAN MISSING OUT ON SOME LEISURELY ACTIVITIES THAT WE ALL LIKE TO DO
I STUDIED PHYSICS IN COLLEGE
AND THE ASTRONOMER I INTERVIEWED HIM AND HE EXPLAINED WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN AND HOW TO VIEW IT
I MEAN THE DAY REMAINED BRIGHT
I USED TO BE A SCIENCE CORRESPONDENT FOR NPR
YOU MIGHT CHASE SOMETHING ELSE
UNFORTUNATELY FEW AMERICANS HAVE SEEN ONE BECAUSE IT'S BEEN 38 YEARS SINCE ONE LAST TOUCHED THE
I DON'T BELIEVE IN GOD
WELL SOON IT WAS OBVIOUS IT WAS GETTING DARK
BUT IT GOT MY ATTENTION AND SO I DID SOME RESEARCH
SO I TALKED TO MY HUSBAND AND WE THOUGHT WELL FEBRUARY
WELL THE DAY OF THE ECLIPSE FOUND US AND MANY OTHER PEOPLE OUT BEHIND THE HYATT REGENCY ON THE BEACH
SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT YEAH IT STARTED WITH MARKETING BUT IT BECAME A REALITY
AND SO AS THE WATER CYCLES DEPICTED IN THIS SLIDE LARGELY SPEAKING THE WATER EVAPORATES IT GOES INTO THE
AND I'LL LEAVE YOU WITH A QUOTE
PATENTS ARE AROUND THE LEGAL PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
IF WE COULD BREAK SOME INTERNATIONAL RANKINGS THAT WOULD BE GREAT AS WELL BUT WE CAN WORK STEP BY STEP
BUILD A COMMUNITY
WHEN I LOOK FORWARD 20 YEARS
THAT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT
I'LL GIVE YOU THREE EXAMPLES OF WHAT THAT MEANS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE
AND IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE I THINK IT'S HUMAN NATURE
SO FOR EVERY SUPER SPECTACULAR SUCCESS THERE'S 2 OR 3 COMPANIES THAT ACTUALLY FAIL
I THINK WE'RE THERE
I WORK FOR A MULTINATIONAL COMPANY
AND IN FACT IT WAS LARGELY FREE
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE THAT WANT TO GROW THEIR COMPANIES
I THINK BY ANY MEASURE IT ABSOLUTELY IS
TALENT LIKES TO BE THERE
WE HAD NO MONEY IT WAS JUST AN IDEA
AND REMEMBER THAT THE COMPETITION IS NOT WARSAW OR WROCLAW AS A PREVIOUS SPEAKER SAID
ANT THAT'S THE CONCEPT I HAVE IN MY MIND
BECAUSE WE ALREADY HAD SOME CRITICAL MASS BUT AS WE TAKE THAT FORWARD WHY IS THAT EVEN IMPORTANT WHY IS THAT RELEVANT
AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS SILICON VALLEY AT LEAST IN MY CONTEXT
AND I THINK SOME OF THE ELEMENTS WE'LL TALK ABOUT BUT I THINK THAT ONE IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE IS THAT IT
YOU CAN'T HAVE ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER
NOW ADD TO THIS RESEARCH FROM THE NGO BIOVERSITY INTERNATIONAL THAT SHOWS A NARROWING OF VARIETY IN
AND ONE EIGHTH OF THAT POPULATION ABOUT 1 MILLION PEOPLE DIED WHEN A PATHOGEN WIPED OUT
WITHIN THIS MODEL SEEDS BECOME NON RENEWABLE RESOURCES INVENTIONS
AND THAT SAME COMPANY IN 2005 ACQUIRED THE WORLD'S LARGEST DEVELOPER AND GROWER OF
I WOULD CHALLENGE YOU THAT WHEN THESE EVENTS DO HAPPEN YOU WOULD CONTINUE TO SET HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR YOURSELF
BASED ON WHAT YOU SEE ON TV YOU WOULD THINK THAT THREE OF US WOULD BE IN SOME SORT OF LEGAL TROUBLE OR BARELY
SHE SAID IT WAS EXPECTATIONS
AND THESE EVENTS WILL INEVITABLY HAPPEN
JORDANIANS HAVE LARGER FAMILIES THAN WE TEND TO HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY VERY COMMON TO HAVE
THEY KNOW THAT
AND DAVID WAS ABLE TO GO ALONG ON THESE TRIPS WITH ME SO WE WERE ABLE TO EXPLORE AND
WE WERE ALSO ABLE TO MEET MORE PEOPLE BECAUSE THE WOMEN WHO COME FROM THE UNIVERSITY ARE
FOR US IT WAS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF OUR LIVES THAT WE TREASURE
SO WHY ARE WE TELLING YOU ALL OF THIS
WHAT'S THE VALUE IN IT FOR YOU
I WOULD FREQUENTLY BE BECKONED MR
KENNEDY AND HAS OPERATED OVER THE LAST 54 YEARS IN WELL OVER 100
IT ALSO DOES HEALTH EDUCATION AND SECONDARY HEALTH CARE
WITH MORE CONTACTS THAT WE'RE ABLE TO MAKE WE CAN FIND OUT WHAT OTHER
EVERYONE IS ON EQUAL FOOTING AND EVERYONE SHARES THE FRUITS OF OUR COLLECTIVE LABOR
BUT ONCE YOUR TEAM IS DEVELOPED CREATE GOALS AND DETERMINE WHAT KIND OF IMPACT YOU WANT TO MAKE
SO WE REACHED OUT
WE HOLD THE GENIUS BAR TO REACH OUT TO THE COMMUNITY AND MORE TEACHERS
THE TECHXPERTS THE IWIZARDS THE TECH CLUB
WHAT ELSE ARE ALL OF THE UNSEEN MICROBES DOING TO KEEP US AND OUR OCEANS HEALTHY
HOW DO WE HELP THE REEF THAT LOOKS LIKE THE RIGHT BACK TOWARDS SOMETHING THAT LOOKS MORE LIKE
BUT MICROBIAL ECOLOGISTS HAVE DESPERATELY NEEDED BREAKTHROUGHS IN TECHNOLOGY SUCH AS WITH THIS FAST
THERE'S ALSO SOME EVIDENCE THAT THE HEALTHY MICROBES ON THE CORAL CAN FIGHT OFF THE
I FIND THAT ASTOUNDING
THERE MAY BE LESS OXYGEN PRESENT THERE MAY BE MORE PATHOGENS THERE AND THERE MAY BE TOXINS PRODUCED BY SOME OF
MY GOAL IS THAT AFTER THIS SHORT JOURNEY YOU'LL SHARE MY AMAZEMENT AT HOW DEEPLY CONNECTED OUR LIVES
WE HAVE MANAGED TO MAKE THE NAME OF THIS THING REMARKABLY COMPLICATED
BUT AS YOU MAY HAVE DISCOVERED SOMETIMES WE SEE WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR
BUT I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT THIS EXAMPLE
I THINK SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE MAY HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THAT
WE CALL IT E
AND I HEAR A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT ON THE WEST COAST WHO SAY OH EL NI O IS COMING WE ARE GOING TO GET RAIN
HOW PEOPLE PERCEIVE US
I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU TO TELL HUMANITY WHAT YOU THINK
WELL MY THINKING WAS WELL SELF DISCOVERY SEEMS TO BE INFINITE
LET ME ASK A QUESTION
PURSUING YOUR PASSION THAT TAKES COURAGE
NOW LET'S REALLY NAIL DOWN PASSION BECAUSE THE IDEA OF NOT EVEN BOTHERING TO SEARCH FOR IT IS STILL RINGING IN MY HEAD
LET'S DO THIS
IF WE ALL FELT STRONGLY ABOUT THE SAME THINGS WE'D ALL BE SOLVING THE SAME PROBLEMS AND IGNORING THE SAME PROBLEMS
IF HUMANITY HELD A TEAM MEETING I WOULD SAY OK
SO I DECIDED TO MAKE MPI THE WORLD'S FIRST OPEN SOURCE PHILOSOPHY
AND I COULD RELATE AND I FELT STRONGLY ABOUT IT
WHAT WAS THE POINT OF IT ALL
WHAT SHOULD I DO NEXT
MY GOAL WAS TO FIND A DUSTY PIECE OF BREAD IN THE TRASH
I WAS FOUR YEARS OLD
AT THE SAME TIME SLEEP DOES
INSTEAD WHAT YOU ACTUALLY SAY
LOOK AT EVERYTHING ELSE WE DO
WE ACTUALLY HAVE ADDICTIVE LIKE HABITS AROUND FOODS
WHAT WE DECIDED TO DO WAS JUST SOMETHING FUN
I TOLD YOU THAT YOU MOST PROBABLY HAVE ADDICTIVE LIKE BEHAVIORS AND YOU DON'T EVEN
DO YOU WANT A BELLY THAT EXTENDS FROM HERE TO THE NEXT STATE
SHE FOUGHT HER FOOD ADDICTION
WE CAN PEER IN THERE WITH SCANS
ENDING UP IN THE GUINNESS BOOK OF WORLD RECORDS FOR HOLDING UP THE LONGEST PLANK
GOD YOU FEEL REALLY GOOD TOO
WE'RE GOING TO GET INTO THAT
YOU'RE CHANGING GENE EXPRESSION
WE FEEL SO GOOD WHEN WE PUT MIND MOUTH AND MUSCLE TOGETHER
YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU NEED TO DO
WHAT DO THEY SPEND IT ON
EVERYONE STAND UP
IT DIED OF EVERY DISEASE VERY EARLY
NOW LISTEN UP
WHAT ABOUT ZZZ'S
ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT
ALL OF THE FALSE FIXES WE ARE USED TO IN LIFE
YOU SEE IT'S NOT A BLACK BOX ANYMORE
NONE OF GROWTH HORMONE ON BOARD WHEN YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT TIME WHEN YOU'RE IMPAIRED THIS WAY
IT'D PICK THEM UP EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU'D HAVE GREENS AND GOOD WHOLE FOODS
SHE FOUGHT HER EVERY SINGLE ADDICTIVE PRACTICE SHE HAD
THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT WORKS ANYMORE
WHEN WE CHANGE GENE EXPRESSION
AND WHAT DO YOU EAT
THESE ARE WHAT WE CALL FALSE FIXES
BUT THEY DO A NUMBER ON YOUR BRAIN
WHAT IT WAS
AH THE MIND
I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING YOU'VE PROBABLY NEVER SEEN BEFORE
IS IT REVERSIBLE
AT THE SAME TIME WHEN YOU DO PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AT THE SAME TIME WHEN YOU MEDITATE THE SAME THING IS HAPPENING
THIS IS WHAT SHE ENDED UP DOING
THAT'S WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE
WHAT ABOUT GETTING TO WORK AT FIVE IN THE MORNING AND LEAVING AT MIDNIGHT
HERE'S THE SOLUTION
YOU HAVE TOO MUCH STRESS HORMONE BIG BELLY
THAT'S A GREAT WAY TO DO IT
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SLEEP
BUT THERE'S ONE OTHER PIECE OF THIS TOO
SURPRISINGLY IT'S NOT KALE
WE'RE GOING TO START WITH THE MIND
WE'RE ETERNAL CAREGIVERS TO OUR OWN DETRIMENT
HOW MANY OF YOU EVER HEARD ABOUT EPIGENETICS
IT'S A KEEN GRASP OF THE OBVIOUS
WHAT ELSE HAMMERS THIS
WHEN THINGS GET A LITTLE TOUGH OUT THERE IT'S USUALLY THAT NATIONAL M NAGE TROIS' ESPECIALLY FOR WOMEN
DO YOU KNOW THAT RATS BAGGED THE MORPHINE AND THE COCAINE AND WENT RIGHT FOR THE FILLING
WHATEVER YOU'RE BORN WITH HONEY THAT WAS YOUR DESTINY
ACTUALLY I DID A NICE LITTLE PIECE ON THIS AND IT WAS FABULOUS
YOU CAN'T MOVE YOUR BLOOD SUGAR
LOOK AT THE OTHER BRAINS
LATE AT NIGHT
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU'RE FILLING THAT VOID WITH THIS
GUESS WHAT SHE ENDED UP DOING
THEY TOOK RATS AND THEY INJECTED THEM WITH MORPHINE AND THEY INJECTED THEM WITH COCAINE AND THEN THEY
OH SURE THEY FIX SORT OF FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND THEN THEY BOOMERANG RIGHT BACK IN YOUR FACE
BUT NOW A FEW MONTHS ON HOWEVER GOOD POLITICIANS ARE AT SWALLOWING FROGS WITHOUT PULLING A FACE AS SOMEONE ONCE PUT IT
NOW THE IDEA THAT ALL OF THIS REPRESENTS I THINK IS RAPIDLY BECOMING A COMMON SENSE AND PART OF
AND I THINK MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE ALSO ASKING WHY BOOST CONSUMPTION RATHER THAN CHANGE WHAT WE CONSUME
IT'S ALREADY IMMERSED IN SOCIAL NETWORKS
THERE WILL BE A MILLION UNEMPLOYED YOUNG PEOPLE HERE BY THE END OF THE YEAR THOUSANDS LOSING THEIR JOBS
I'M NOT SUGGESTING THE CROWDS ARE ABOUT TO STORM THE BARRICADES AND STRING UP EVERY INVESTMENT BANKER FROM THE NEAREST
AND EVERYWHERE AS PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THE UNPRECEDENTED SUMS WHICH ARE BEING SPENT OF OUR MONEY AND OUR CHILDREN'S MONEY
PERHAPS WE'D ACHIEVE SIMILAR PRODUCTIVITY GAINS IN SOCIETY TO THOSE WE'VE HAD IN THE
AND SOME ARE QUITE STRUCTURAL LIKE SOCIAL IMPACT BONDS WHERE YOU RAISE MONEY TO INVEST IN DIVERTING
EDUCATION SIX SEVEN EIGHT PERCENT OF THE ECONOMY AND GROWING
I THINK WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT THIS WHOLE MOVEMENT WHICH IS GROWING FROM THE MARGINS REMAINS QUITE SMALL
IN RECENT YEARS A LOT OF INTELLIGENT PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT CAPITALISM HAD BASICALLY WON
THAN BEING EXPLOITED BY MULTINATIONAL CAPITALISM IS NOT BEING EXPLOITED BY MULTINATIONAL CAPITALISM
AND JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO PRESIDENT OBAMA LAUNCHED THE OFFICE OF SOCIAL INNOVATION IN THE WHITE HOUSE
IT WON'T BE THE ONES LINING UP FOR HANDOUTS LIKE CARS AND AEROSPACE AND
SOME OF THE IDEAS ARE STRANGE
WE WERE NATURALLY DEFERENTIAL
AND I'M HERE TO HELP
AND THEN AS NOW IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL PLACE OF BALLS AND PUNTS BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE MANY OF WHOM
AND I SPENT QUITE A LOT OF TIME WITH THEM RATHER THAN IN PUNTS
AND EVER SINCE THEN I'VE WONDERED WHY IT IS THAT CAPITALISM IS SO AMAZINGLY EFFICIENT AT SOME THINGS BUT SO
HISTORY WAS OVER AND SOCIETY WOULD INEVITABLY HAVE TO TAKE SECOND PLACE
HI MY NAME IS MARYAM ELASSAR
ALLOW ME TO SHARE THIS WITH YOU AS WELL
MY DAD IS A FARMER
IF CONFIRMED THIS WOULD HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON OUR DEFINITION OF LIFE ON HOW WE LOOK FOR LIFE
THE GREAT EMISSARY OF WEST AFRICAN DRUMMING TO NORTH AMERICA BABATUNDE OLATUNJI
BOTH MODES OF EXPRESSION ARE INTIMATELY CONNECTED
I THINK WE'RE HARDWIRED FOR IT
SPEAKING IN THE MOUTH THE DRUMMER EMULATES THE SOUNDS OF THE DRUM AS A STREAM OF SYLLABLES AND
AND A WAY TO THINK OF THIS IS TO IMAGINE YOURSELF FLOATING DOWN A RIVER WITH YOUR FRIENDS SHARING THE SAME
NOW IN WEST AFRICAN SOCIETIES ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT SPEAK TONAL LANGUAGES LIKE BAMBARA
NOW A TRAINED DRUMMER CAN JUST AS EASILY SPEAK THE RHYTHM WITH THEIR MOUTH AS THEY CAN WITH THEIR HANDS ON THE DRUM
I WAS MAD AND DISAPPOINTED
I KNEW I HAD TO VALIDATE IT
YOU'RE TAKING THAT STEP FORWARD FOR EVERY ONE AROUND YOU THAT YOU'RE SUPPORTING
A SECOND CHANCE TO RECONSIDER THEIR DECISION
AND YOU SAY WHAT CAN I DO
YOU CAN BE YOUR DREAMS AND YOU CAN MAKE YOUR DREAMS HAPPEN
I HAD NO IDEA IF KIDS WERE GOING TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY IF IT ACTUALLY HAD ANY KIND OF SCIENTIFIC VALIDATION
AND THE NEXT DAY TYLER JUMPED OFF THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE TO HIS DEATH
AND RATHER IRONICALLY ADULTS THAT CONTROLS DECISION MAKING AND IMPULSE CONTROL
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT
WHAT DO THEY LOOK LIKE
THAT'S TOO LONG IF YOU'RE POOR
IT WILL LAY WASTE TO SOCIAL CONFIDENCE
HE WAS GOING TO BE DEAD BY THE AGE OF 25
MOST OF OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM IS PUSH
BUT IT WILL ALSO LAY WASTE TO IMAGINATION
EVERY CHILD UP TO THE AGE OF 15 WHO WANTS A PLACE IN SCHOOL WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE ONE IN 2015
AND THERE WILL BE NO MISTAKES
IT WILL STRATIFY SOCIETY AS MUCH AS IT LIBERATES IT
IT WILL BRING SKILLS AND LEARNING AND READING
WELL YOU CREATE YOUR OWN TEACHERS
IT'S THE LARGEST NGO IN EDUCATION IN THE WORLD
THERE IS AN AMAZING SCHOOL IN NORTHEN QUEENSLAND CALLED JARINGAN
NOW THEY'RE NOT MARRIED AND THEY WANT TO GO ON TO STUDY FURTHER TO HAVE A CAREER
WE'LL GROW BY SIX CITIES OF 12 MILLION PEOPLE A YEAR FOR THE NEXT 30 YEARS
ALMOST ALL OF THAT GROWTH WILL BE IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD
HE EMPLOYED 200 PEOPLE
AND WE ARE BEQUEATHING TO THE DEVELOPING WORLD SCHOOL SYSTEMS THAT THEY WILL NOW SPEND A CENTURY
I ACTUALLY STARTED FIRST GRADE WITH A BIG CAST ALL OVER MY TORSO
YOU WOULD THINK THAT BECAUSE THESE IMPLANTS ARE OPTIMIZED FOR SPEECH THEY WERE DESIGNED FOR SPEECH
THE BRAINS REMAIN HARDWIRED FOR MUSIC
YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO HEAR IT
BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN
BUT YOU COULD SAY THIS IS STILL RATHER ACADEMIC
DO WE HAVE TO GO AND DIG IN NORTH AFRICA OR SOUTHEAST ASIA
I'D LIKE YOU TO THINK ONE OF YOUR SECRETS
I'LL EXPLAIN TO YOU WHY
LIKE THE BRAIN IMAGE YOU CAN'T KNOW
SO WE CAN'T TRAIN OUR MACHINE ON ONE PERSON AND USE IT FOR ANOTHER PERSON
WHERE IS IT
WHAT IS SHE HEARING
ALL WE NEED TO DO IS TO FIND THE ROSETTA STONE FOR THE BRAIN RIGHT
SO HOW CAN WE READ THESE OUT
IT'S A VERY SIMILAR PROBLEM
BUT INSTEAD OTHERS MIGHT HAVE SAID I THINK IT ACTUALLY MEANS SOMETHING
BUT THIS SAYS IT'S QUITE DIFFERENT
IT DOESN'T SAY ON THERE THIS PERSON IS THINKING ABOUT THE BRANDENBURG GATE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN
BUT HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS
WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE'S BEHAVIOR THEIR DECISIONS THINGS THAT ARE RELEVANT
DOES THAT MEAN NOW YOU OPEN TO MANIPULATION
THIS NOW MAKES THE TASK VERY SIMPLE
IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WELL ON THE SECOND PERSON
WE TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE THOUGHTS ARE A PERSON HAS
BUT YOU COULD SAY IF SOMEONE'S IN A BRAIN SCANNER LOOKING AT AN IMAGE I JUST HAVE TO LOOK AT THE IMAGE THEY'RE LOOKING AT AND I'LL KNOW WHAT
HOW DOES THIS WORK IN DETAIL
WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS MEANS
FOR EXAMPLE POTENTIAL LIE DETECTORS OR BRAIN MARKETING LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN
FOR THIS WE USE SO CALLED BRAIN SCANNERS
SO THAT'S WHAT WE DO
LET'S LOOK FOR SOMETHING EVEN MORE INTERESTING
IT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE STUMBLED ON THE TRANSLATION
WHERE DO WE HAVE TO GO AND DIG
IS THAT HOW WE MEASURE THE BRAIN ACTIVITY PATTERNS FOR ALL THESE THOUGHTS THEY MIGHT HAVE
WE CAN'T TELL THIS FROM THE SURFACE OF THE BODY FROM THE BODY LANGUAGE OR FROM FACE WE SOMEHOW NEED TO
ON THE RIGHT ARE THE CORRESPONDING PATTERNS OF THE BRAIN ACTIVITY
BUT WHAT IS SHE SURPRISED ABOUT
WHAT COULD THAT BE
THIS WORKS INCREDIBLY WELL AS WELL
WHAT IS SHE LOOKING AT
WHERE IS THE ROSETTA STONE FOR THE BRAIN GOING TO BE
NOW THERE ARE A NUMBER OF TECHNICAL ISSUES ENSUING FROM THIS
HOW DO I KNOW THIS
WE MUST CEASE TELLING PEOPLE THAT THEY HAVE TO ACT A CERTAIN WAY THAT THEY HAVE TO BEHAVE A CERTAIN WAY
THE ANTIBIOTIC PRODUCERS THAT'S ONE WEAPON
OUR LITTLE MINIATURE DINOSAURS
LAST NIGHT I WENT ONLINE AND DID SOME RESEARCH
THINGS ALMOST DIDN'T WORK OUT
IT WORKS FOR DECADES
I WORK A LOT
PHYSICS IS REALLY FIGURING OUT HOW TO DISCOVER NEW THINGS THAT ARE COUNTERINTUITIVE LIKE QUANTUM MECHANICS
IT'LL WORK FOR PROBABLY A CENTURY
SO WE HAD A 100000 SPORTS CAR WHICH WAS THE ROADSTER
IT'S MUCH LIKE ON A JET
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WE DID A SURVEY OF SOME OF THE WORLD'S LEADING A
BUT EVEN A PRESENT DAY TRANSISTOR OPERATES AT THE GIGAHERTZ
COULDN'T FIND A BUG
YOU UNDERSTOOD EXACTLY WHAT I JUST SAID IN ENGLISH
EXCUSE ME WOULD YOU MIND IF I PERUSE YOUR STOCK PORTFOLIO
CHINESE DOESN'T LET ME IGNORE IT
4 BILLION DIFFERENT WAYS THAT A FAMILY CAN FIND ITSELF
LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE
IF WE WERE SPEAKING MANDARIN CHINESE WITH EACH OTHER THOUGH I WOULDN'T HAVE THAT LUXURY
DO YOU MIND TELLING ME
AND JUST IN SUMMARY NO MATTER HOW FAR I PUSH THIS I CAN'T GET IT TO BREAK
COULD HOW YOU SPEAK ABOUT TIME COULD HOW YOUR LANGUAGE FORCES YOU TO THINK ABOUT TIME AFFECT YOUR PROPENSITY TO
WOULD YOU MIND SQUEEZING AS HARD AS YOU CAN IN YOUR DOMINANT HAND THIS DEVICE SO I CAN MEASURE YOUR GRIP STRENGTH
DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW HOW MUCH YOUR HOUSE IS WORTH
WHAT I'M HERE TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT TODAY IS AN INTRIGUING NEW HYPOTHESIS AND SOME SURPRISINGLY POWERFUL NEW
SO MANY OF YOU KNOW IN THIS ROOM THAT ENGLISH IS A GERMANIC LANGUAGE
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE FIND
SUPPOSE I WERE TALKING WITH YOU AND I WAS INTRODUCING YOU TO MY UNCLE
THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC FINANCIAL CRISIS HAS REIGNITED PUBLIC INTEREST IN SOMETHING THAT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF THE OLDEST
LINGUISTS AND COGNITIVE SCIENTISTS HAVE BEEN EXPLORING THIS QUESTION FOR MANY YEARS NOW
NOW HOW MIGHT THAT BE
WHAT WE SHOULD EXPECT THEN IS THE OPPOSITE EFFECT
IN THIS CASE WE'VE GROWN A CORNER BLOCK
YOU DON'T NEED A LOT OF EQUIPMENT TO SET UP A PRODUCTION FACILITY
THIS IS CRAZY
THEY CAN ACTUALLY PUT THIS IN THEIR NATURAL ECOSYSTEM WITHOUT ANY PROCESSING AND IT'S GOING TO IMPROVE THE LOCAL SOIL
IT JUST DROPS THEM THE SHORTEST DISTANCE POSSIBLE TO THE FOREST FLOOR WHERE THEY'RE ACTUALLY
AND THIS ISN'T JUST FOUND IN PACKAGING
THEY'RE NOT BIOLOGICALLY COMPATIBLE
SECOND OF ALL WE SHOULD REALLY STRIVE TO USE FAR LESS ENERGY IN CREATING THESE MATERIALS
YOU CAN THINK ABOUT RENAISSANCE FLORENCE YOU CAN THINK ABOUT PARIS IN THE YEARS JUST BEFORE AND AFTER WORLD WAR
IT WOULD JUST BE IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THE DATA
BUT WE KNOW FROM NUMEROUS SOCIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDIES THAT IQ ITSELF IS IN FACT HIGHLY
EACH GROUP SAW THE OTHER AS AN ATTACK ON THEM AS SOMETHING THAT MADE THEM QUESTION WHETHER THEY
YOU SEE LANGUAGE IS MORE THAN JUST NAMING THINGS
IF YOU APPROXIMATE YOU'LL BE PRONE TO AN OVERESTIMATION
IMAGINE BEING IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH CHARLIE SHEEN
THAT'S BECAUSE THE RAT DOESN'T HAVE SELF AWARENESS OR A LINGUISTIC ABILITY TO
NOW YOU SEE HOW I USED THE WORD APPROXIMATE
YOU SEE MATHEMATICS LIES RIGHT AT THE ROOTS OF HUMANITY
SO IF YOU GET PEOPLE TO THINK ABOUT LOVE AND THEN SOLVE PROBLEMS THEY'LL BE BETTER AT THE GLOBALIZATION
EASY AS THAT
SO WITH PARTNERS WE CAN BEHAVE A BIT LIKE PROUD PARENTS
BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY A MINI TESTOSTERONE PEAK EVERY 2 TO 2
MAYBE THE BEST WAY OR THE MATHEMATICS REVEALED THAT HAVING HIGH STANDARDS AND FINDING WAYS TO REACH FOR THOSE
WE GAVE THEM OUR GAME AS A TRAINING TOOL AND WE CREATED A COLLABORATIVE QUEST
DID YOU JUST FEEL IT
EVERYONE HAS MORE
JUST THINK ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW THAT STARTED A BUSINESS AND FAILED
THE STUDY AT THE EINSTEIN MEDICAL COLLEGE SAID BALLROOM DANCING TWO OR THREE TIMES A WEEK
ASKING THESE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THESE BOYS AND GIRLS TO DANCE TOGETHER BALLROOM STYLE
NOW BEING PALESTINIAN MEANT WE WERE UPROOTED FROM OUR HOME IN 1948 FOR THE CREATION OF THE STATE
YOU SIT UP STRAIGHTER YOU FEEL POSITIVE AND CONFIDENT AND YOU SEND OUT WITH YOUR BODY LANGUAGE AND YOUR POSTURE
MY FATHER WAS FROM BELFAST NORTHERN IRELAND AND HE WAS PROTESTANT MY MOTHER PALESTINIAN
THIS WAS THE HARDEST PROJECT I HAVE EVER EVER DONE YET THE MOST
I RETURNED TO JAFFA AND I WORKED WITH JEWISH AND PALESTINIAN
HE WAS NINE YEARS OLD
THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER SIMILAR STORIES BUT BALLROOM DANCING ISN'T ONLY FOR CHILDREN
THIS IS THE MAGIC OF BALLROOM DANCING
EINSTEIN SAID I FEAR THE DAY WHEN TECHNOLOGY TAKES OVER OUR HUMAN INTERACTION
YOU MIGHT ASK
WHEN I CALL YOU LADIES AND GENTLEMEN YOU FEEL DIFFERENTLY ABOUT YOURSELF
IF TWO PACKS OF EQUAL SIZE MEET THE PACK WITH THE OLD WOLF WINS 2
SO WE'RE DOING TWO THINGS HERE
THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD GOAL
WHAT IF I'M MISSING SOMETHING IMPORTANT
AND THAT'S THAT WE'RE CHANGING THE QUESTION THAT WE'RE ANSWERING
MAYBE LIKE IN MEDICINE WHERE WE HAVE A HIPPOCRATIC OATH TO RECOGNIZE THE RESPONSIBILTY AND THIS
IMAGINE YOU HAD WEB BROWSERS THAT HELPED ROUTE YOU TO THESE KINDS OF DESIGN PRODUCTS
BUT THAT WOULD KIND OF BE LIKE OUR GOAL WITH MESSAGING BEFORE WHERE WE'RE JUST TRYING TO DELIVER A MESASGE
WHATEVER THAT WAS FOR THEM BY THE WAY
DESIGN CAN FIX THIS PROBLEM
BECAUSE IT LEAVES US WITH THIS ALL OR NOTHING RELATIONSHIP WITH TECHNOLOGY RIGHT
MY FRIENDS THINK I DO
NANCY MIGHT WANT TO DISCONNECT BUT THEN SHE'D BE WORRIED
I ALREADY HAVE A HISTORY OF DEPRESSION I'VE BEEN HOSPITALIZED FOR BEING SUICIDAL I
I WAS AN INNOCENT CHILD AND THE ABUSE WAS NOT MY FAULT
MY STORY TODAY IS A STORY OF RESPONSIBILITY
I HAVE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FACT THAT MY ABUSE HAPPENED
WHEN YOU TAKE RESPONSIBILITY YOU WILL HAVE THE POWER TO CHANGE THE WHOLE WORLD
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE WE SAID OH I CAN'T
LET GO OF ANGER AND TOXIC PEOPLE
GROOMING IS HOW A CHILD'S SEX PREDATOR WEEDS OUT THE STRONG KIDS WITH HIGH SELF
THAT FEELING OF HAPPINESS DOESN'T COME FROM THE ACTUAL MOMENT BUT INSTEAD HOW WE DECIDE TO
THAT'S CALLED OUR EMOTIONAL RESPONSE
IT'S CALLED RESPONSIBILITY
IT COMES FROM WHO YOU GET TO BE WHILE YOU'RE DOING THAT JOB
ALL THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED WHICH MADE THAT RESUME THAT MADE YOUR LIFE STORY THAT'S WHAT REVEALS YOUR BLUEPRINT
I NEEDED TO ALLOW THE DREAM TO CHANGE FORM
I THINK IT'S BECAUSE WHEN WE ARE IN DOUBT WE LOOK TO OUR RESUME
THE ANSWER CAME TO ME IN A FLASH
BUT IT'S AN EPIDEMIC THAT HAS A CURE
SHE WAS A TOP SALESPERSON SHE WON ALL THE CARS ALL THE TRIPS BUT SHE STARTED TALKING ABOUT HOW SHE WAS
BUT AT THE TIME WE MET HE WASN'T SURE WHAT HE WANTED TO DO NEXT
AND THEN WHAT DO YOU DO
EVERYONE'S UNIQUE WE DON'T CROSS OVER WE DON'T HAVE TO COMPETE
BUT WHEN WE GO TO PICK THAT COLLEGE MAJOR THE QUESTION CHANGES FROM WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE WHEN YOU GROW UP
BUT WHEN I THINK ABOUT THIS SUBJECT I THINK OF MY GRANDFATHER MY IMMIGRANT GRANDFATHER WHO LEFT POLAND
THAT'S WHAT DETERMINES HOW EACH EGG IS UNIQUE
HE WOULD SAY
HAPPY AT WORK
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT HAPPY
WHETHER IT'S SECULARIZED OR A SPIRITUAL ONE
AND WHERE'S THIS ANGST COMING FROM
IT WAS MUCH LATER WHEN I STARTED TO STUDY IT FORMALLY THAT I UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD WHEN
THERE'S A LOT OF BRUTALITY GOING ON BUT THERE'S STILL THIS MUSIC
HOW CAN I NOW CALL MY MOMMA A BITCH AND THINK OF HER AS ANYTHING LESS THAN THE POWERFUL WOMAN SHE WAS WHO MADE HER
I FALL IN LOVE WITH MY BEST FRIEND
SO WHY IS THIS MUSIC NOT SPEAKING TO MY CONDITION
THEY WEREN'T TALKING ABOUT A QUEER LITTLE BLACK BOY IN LITTLE ROCK ARKANSAS
BUT I WAS ABLE TO TAKE THIS MUSIC SOMEHOW WHICH HAD BEEN A GIFT FROM MY FATHER I DON'T THINK HE KNEW IT WAS A GIFT
GOSPEL IS ABOUT A COMMUNAL SHARING OF AN EXPERIENCE
MEANTIME I AM THIS ADOLESCENT PRETEEN TRYING TO FIND MY WAY HERE
AT THE CAR PARTIES MY PARENTS HAD OR WHEN RELATIVES HAD BARBECUES IF AN AL GREEN SONG A MARVIN GAYE SONG
THERE'S A CALL AND RESPONSE TO MUSIC
AND THIS IS TRUE FOR EVERY SINGLE CANCER
EVENTUALLY THESE INNOVATIONS WILL GET OUT AND FIND EVERYONE
TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION BEHAVES A LOT LIKE WEALTH AND CAPITAL
IS THEIR EXPERIENCE CHANGED
AND SO THERE WAS A BIG MOVEMENT TO PUT ALL THIS INFORMATION ONLINE TO TRACK ALL THE
WE HAVE THESE GREAT NEW PARTNERS IN OUR DREAM FOR A BRIGHTER FUTURE
THINK OF THINGS THAT COULD BE AT RISK OF DYING OUT LIKE SMALL AGRICULTURE OR SKILLED TRADES
THAT'S THREE TIMES AS MANY AS NEW YORK CITY TAKES
I HAD A LOT OF
THEY ARE HARD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER AS THEY ARE
AND MY BROTHER TURNED AROUND TO ME AND SAID I'M REALLY CONCERNED THAT YOU CAN'T KEEP A NORMAL JOB FOR MORE
EVERYTHING WE'VE BEEN TRAINED TO DO
BUT YOU SPENT SEVEN YEARS TRAINING TO BE A DOCTOR
WE HAVE SET GUIDELINES
MEDICINE IS COMPLICATED
POTENTIALLY THEY HAVEN'T REPRESENT OUR HUMAN BODY
I DON T BLAME THEM
IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT I'VE GONE A LITTLE BIT OFF TRACK
THIS WASN'T EASILY ACCEPTED BY EVERYBODY AROUND ME
I ALSO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE WORD BIMAR
SO I WENT THROUGH ALL THE USUAL QUESTIONS
I ASKED HIM ABOUT PRESENTING COMPLAINT HIS MEDICAL HISTORY HIS DRUG HISTORY ALLERGIES
ABED WOULD SAY I'M SORRY
NO I WAS QUIET
BUT I ALSO SAW IN MY REFLECTION THAT HAD ABED NOT INJURED ME I WOULD NOW IN ALL LIKELIHOOD BE A
WHEN ONE MORNING YEARS AFTER THE CRASH I STEPPED ONTO STONE AND THE UNDERSIDE OF MY LEFT FOOT FELT THE FLASH OF
A FRIEND POINTED OUT TO ME THAT ALL OF MY BIG STORIES MIRRORED MY OWN EACH CENTERING ON A LIFE THAT HAD
I THEN BEGAN TO WONDER AS I HAD MANY TIMES BEFORE HOW MY LIFE WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT HAD THIS MAN NOT INJURED ME HAD MY
AND IT WAS THEN I UNDERSTOOD THAT NO MATTER HOW STARK THE REALITY THE HUMAN BEING FITS IT INTO A NARRATIVE THAT IS
IT WAS THIS YOUTH WHO ON MAY 16 1990 HAD BROKEN TWO NECKS INCLUDING MINE AND BRUISED
THE PERPETRATOR BECOMES THE VICTIM
BUT I DIDN'T SAY THESE THINGS TO ABED
I WAS QUIET BECAUSE I HAD NOT COME FOR TRUTH
I WOULD BE LESS MINDFUL OF TIME AND OF DEATH AND OH I WOULD NOT BE DISABLED WOULD NOT SUFFER THE THOUSAND
I SUPPOSE THEY WERE TRUE
BUT WHAT TO GET THE MAN WHO BROKE YOUR FUCKING NECK
I DIDN'T SEE ABED COMING
MY SHOES FLEW OFF
I MEAN LOOK AT THE ELEPHANT
SIR DAVID ATTENBOROUGH HE'S COME OVER
WHY SHOULD IT BE THERE
IT'S WHAT WE OUGHT TO BE DOING
THAT CRAZY WOMAN
I'LL GO AHEAD WITH THAT
HE'S COME OVER
THERE WAS PROFESSOR TOBIAS
YEAH WELL WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THAT
THEY CAN ALL BE WRONG
SOME OF THEM HAVE COME OVER
AND HE CALLED IT HYPOTHESIS FREE SCIENCE
NOW 50 YEARS AGO THAT WAS A LAUGHABLY SIMPLE QUESTION
EVERYBODY KNEW THE ANSWER
IT WAS WRONG
IT'S SIMPLY NOT GOING TO HAPPEN UNLESS THE FEMALE IS ON BOARD WITH THE ACTION
BUT SOME ANIMALS HAD IT GOING ON QUITE A BIT BEFORE THAT
NOW WHEN HUMANS THINK ABOUT SEX MALE AND FEMALE FORMS ARE GENERALLY WHAT COME TO MIND BUT FOR MANY
SIMPLY INSERT PART A INTO SLOT B AND WE SHOULD ALL BE GOOD TO GO
AND QUITE FRANKLY THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT IS
BUT ORGASM DIDN'T ACTUALLY EVOLVE UNTIL ABOUT 65 MILLION YEARS AGO WITH THE ADVENT OF MAMMALS
I COME BACK TO THE PRISON NOT BECAUSE I HAVE ISSUES
I MUST ADMIT WHEN I FIRST WENT TO MY CEREMONY I WAS NOT QUITE SURE WHAT TO EXPECT
BUT IT WAS UNBELIEVABLY MOVING
EVERYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD CAN AND WILL CONTINUE JUDGING AND EVALUATING YOU
I'VE TAKEN TO CALLING THIS THE WILLENDORF EFFECT AND ONCE AGAIN WE SEE IT REINFORCED IN MANY ASPECTS OF HER
THEY EXPERIENCE LESS SEXISM
SHE WAS AN OBJECT
WE SEE IT IN ADVERTISEMENTS
WHAT ARE THE FIRST WORDS THAT COME TO MIND WHEN YOU PICTURE A PREGNANT WOMAN
I ALSO ASKED HETEROSEXUAL MEN TO IMAGINE A WOMAN THAT THEY'RE PARTNERED WITH IS PREGNANT AND THEN ASKED WOMEN TO
THIS IS MAINLY BECAUSE IT IS REQUIRED THAT EVERY STATE SENDS THIS FATAL CRASH INFORMATION TO THE FEDERAL
THEY REPRESENT OUR SAFETY AND THE SAFETY OF ALL OUR LOVED ONES
IT'S THE SAME THING IN BANGLADESH
THAT'S A TOUGH REALITY
NOW LET'S SEE IF WE CAN PAY FOR THE FUNERAL
THEY HAD NEVER HEARD THAT BEFORE
AND I GOT THE CALL THAT HE PASSED AWAY
I HOPE YOU THINK ABOUT THAT FOR THE REST OF THE DAY
WHY WOULD WE PUT THE GUY IN THE GROUND
WHY WAS HE JUST LAYING ON THE TABLE
I TELL THESE STORIES NOT TO MAKE YOU SAD SO I HOPE AS THE FIRST SPEAKER THIS DOESN'T GET YOU DOWN FOR THE REST OF
SO WE RING UP BANGLADESH AND SAY HEY WHATEVER YOU PAID FOR THE FUNERAL PLEASE LET US KNOW WE'LL PROVIDE YOU WITH THAT AS WELL AS A
THAT'S REALLY HARD TO DEAL WITH
THAT YOU CAN BE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO BE YOU CAN BE WHOEVER YOU WANT TO BE BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE ANY VALUE
IN SEPTEMBER 2007 I WENT TO BANGLADESH WORKING WITH HABITAT FOR HUMANITY
WALKING THROUGH LAND THAT USED TO HAVE VILLAGES ON IT
LITERALLY GRABBED THE KIDS BY THE EARS DRAGGING THEM OFF THE COURT
THE FLOWERS ARE NAMED AFTER HIM THE MOUNTAINS ARE CARVED WITH HIS SLOGANS
I LIVE IN AMERICA THEIR OTHER ENEMY
BUT THAT TURNED OUT TO BE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE
AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT WHEN YOU COMBINED THE VIRTUAL LABORATORIES WITH TEACHER LED COACHING AND
IT'S AN EXPRESSION OF LOVE
HE JUST COULDN'T CAPTURE THE PICTURE
BUT EVERY OTHER MEDIUM DOES IT
THE SHIPS START IN ENGLAND THEY COME DOWN FROM ENGLAND THEY GO TO AFRICA THEY GO ACROSS THE OCEAN THAT'S THE MIDDLE PASSAGE PART THEY COME TO AMERICA
THEY RECORD WHEN SOMEBODY PRESSES PLAY WHEN SOMEBODY PRESSES PAUSE WHAT PARTS THEY SKIP WHAT PARTS THEY WATCH AGAIN
IN 2009 GOOGLE ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WERE ABLE WITH DATA ANALYSIS TO PREDICT OUTBREAKS OF
WHAT KINDS OF SHOWS THEY LIKE WHAT KIND OF PRODUCERS WHAT KIND OF ACTORS
THEY USE DATA TO FIRST UNDERSTAND LOTS OF PIECES ABOUT THEIR AUDIENCE THAT THEY OTHERWISE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO UNDERSTAND AT THAT
AND SO WHEN AMAZON IS GIVING OUT FREE STUFF YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE IT RIGHT
SO INSTEAD OF HOLDING A COMPETITION WHAT HE DID AND HIS TEAM OF COURSE WAS THEY LOOKED AT ALL THE DATA THEY
TAKING APART AND PUTTING BACK TOGETHER AGAIN
EVEN THE MOST DATA SAVVY COMPANIES GET IT WRONG
AND THAT'S NOT BECAUSE A COMPANY LIKE MULTI HEALTH SYSTEMS DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH DATA
THERE'S ANOTHER TOOL THAT CAN DO THAT AND WE ALL HAVE IT AND THAT TOOL IS THE BRAIN
BUT THAT DOES NOT CHANGE THE BASIC SETUP
AND OF COURSE THAT'S A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE SPACE
THAT'S THE TV PRODUCTION COMPANY OF AMAZON
OK THAT'S GOOD ACTUALLY
AND ALL OF THAT GOES BACK TO A DECISION THAT ROY HAD TO MAKE ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO
THEN YOU HAVE A TOP TWO PERCENT SHOW
HE MAY HAVE ALSO BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR 22 VERY ENTERTAINING MINUTES BUT NOT VERY MANY OF YOU
HE WANTS TO ENGINEER SUCCESS
THE FIRST ONE IS YOU TAKE THAT PROBLEM APART INTO ITS BITS AND PIECES SO THAT YOU CAN DEEPLY ANALYZE THOSE BITS AND
BUT IT'S NOT ONLY WATER WHICH IS THE PROBLEM
LIKE MANY OTHERS AT THE SAME TIME WE CAME UP WITH THE IDEA OF SOURCE SEPARATION
AND WE CAN EXTRACT RESOURCES
THE OIL IS PRICED OFF THE MARGIN
SOMEBODY THE OTHER DAY SAID I WAS THE SECOND LARGEST NATURAL GAS PRODUCER IN THE UNITED STATES
THERE IS NO QUESTION
AND I SAID BRIDGE TO WHAT
I WITNESSED MY FIRST FRACK JOB AT BORDER TEXAS IN 1953
I'M NOT SURE
I GOT OUT OF SCHOOL IN 51
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE ENERGY
BUT NO I'M NOT
IT'S MY LIFE
THIS STUFF IS EVERYWHERE
I OWN STOCKS
WHERE ARE WE HEADED
I THINK IT'S PROBABLY 175 BILLION BARRELS
THERE HAD TO HAVE BEEN 800000 WELLS FRACKED IN OKLAHOMA TEXAS KANSAS
WORTH T HAS BEEN ON IT FOR 25 YEARS
DON'T I WISH
SO I THINK I'VE MADE MY POINT THAT WE HAVE TO
IF WE DID WE COULD SEE THAT OUR OWN RESOURCES ARE EASIER TO USE THAN ANYBODY
YOU'VE MADE THE MONEY YOU NEED
FRACKING CAME OUT IN 47 AND DON'T BELIEVE FOR A MINUTE WHEN OUR PRESIDENT GETS UP THERE AND SAYS
I'M TALKING ABOUT OPEC OIL
IT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO USE IN THE FUTURE
NOW THAT INCLUDES THE COST OF MILITARY AND THE COST OF THE FUEL BOTH
WHY ARE ALL THE TRASH TRUCKS TODAY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ON NATURAL GAS
ARE WE SMARTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE
I SAW MY FIRST ONE IN 53
SEE BUT AGAIN I TOLD YOU I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY WITH THAT
IT'S ALMOST LIKE A SCENE OF WASTED POTENTIAL
WHO IS IT THAT MANUFACTURES THESE PRODUCTS
I FOCUS ON SYNDROME FROM THE INCREDIBLES
I'LL GET TO THAT IN A MINUTE
I SPECIALIZE IN TEACHING ALGEBRA TO THE BOTTOM 25 OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND I WORK MOSTLY WITH THOSE
SHE HAD TO MULTIPLY 2 X 9 AND GOT STUCK
WE TAKE THE BLAME FOR A STUDENT WHO CAN'T STAY AWAKE IN CLASS BECAUSE SHE SPENDS HER NIGHTS ON A DIFFERENT COUCH DEPENDING ON WHICH FRIEND TAKES
NOW SHE TRIED AND FAILED FOUR DIFFERENT TIMES ON HER FINGERS ON PAPER IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH
THAT MOMENT WHEN A STUDENT SAYS THANK YOU FOR HELPING HIM GRADUATE WITH A 2
HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE THEY'RE GETTING ENOUGH SLEEP GETTING ENOUGH TO EAT SHOWING UP FOR CLASS
FIRST WORDS IN THE RESPONSE THAT'S NOT RIGOROUS
WHY NOT STOP JUDGING THE FISH ON HOW THEY CLIMB TREES
BUY THE NEXT TEXT BOOK
ALL SHE HAD TO DO IS COUNT BY TWOS NINE TIMES
THE ONLY WAY TO FEED A BUSINESS MODEL IN THIS TOXIC CULTURE OF EDUCATION IS TO
I'VE GOT STUDENTS THAT WANT TO BE TATTOO ARTISTS MECHANICS BARBERS THEY WANT WORK
THERE I WAS WORKING WITH A STUDENT NATALIE ON SOLVING EQUATIONS
NATALIE WAS 16 YEARS OLD AND IN THE 9TH GRADE AND SHE'S NOT ALONE NOT BY A LONG SHOT
I TEACH AT A HIGH SCHOOL WITH A STUDENT POPULATION OF NEAR 3000
AND THEN WHAT ABOUT THE NATALIES
I'VE SEEN MY DAUGHTER'S KINDERGARTEN AND FIRST GRADE ASSIGNMENTS
125 GIRLS WILL NOT BE MARRIED WHEN THEY ARE 12 YEARS OLD
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WHAT DO YOU NEED
WE ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE
EVERYBODY WERE TELLING US ANGELENE HAD BEEN MOVING FROM ONE PLACE BECAUSE SHE'S AN ORPHAN SHE HAS NO MOTHER SHE HAS NO FATHER MOVING FROM
THE REASON WHY IF I RAN AWAY MY FATHER WILL HAVE A STIGMA PEOPLE WILL BE CALLING HIM THE
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING
AS I WENT BACK I STARTED TALKING TO THE MEN TO THE VILLAGE AND MOTHERS AND I SAID I WANT TO GIVE BACK THE WAY I HAD
THE ONLY THING WORSE IS ABSOLUTE TYRANNY WHERE YOU ARE RULED BY A DESPOT
HOW MANY OF YOU SAID THAT
YOU COULD SUPPORT YOURSELF AND YOUR FAMILY AND YOU WOULD BE HAPPY
EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN UNIQUE TALENTS AND IDEAS THAT THEY WANT TO SHARE BUT IT STARTS WHEN WE LISTEN TO
THERE'S JUST A RUSH DAY
NUMBER ONE NEVER SWIM IN ANYTHING THAT ENDS IN CREEK OR CANAL
BUT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE CITIZENS WALKING AROUND WITH HARD DRIVES PICKING UP DATA FROM CITY AGENCIES TO MAKE IT PUBLIC IT WAS ALREADY KIND OF PUBLIC
YOU PUT IN YOUR ADDRESS YOU GET LOCAL COMPLAINTS
WHEN IS RUSH HOUR EXACTLY
AND THAT'S WHERE THIS DATA CAME FROM
WE CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT AS A CITY
IT'S NOT THE BEST USE OF OUR CITIZENS' TIME AND WE AS A CITY CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT
I'M GOING TO WRITE A PROGRAM
NYC THAT ALLOWS YOU TO SUBSCRIBE TO 311 COMPLAINTS AROUND YOUR OWN HOME OR AROUND YOUR OFFICE
AND IT WASN'T JUST ME WHO FOUND A PARKING TICKET
AND WE CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT AS A CITY
WE DON'T NEED OUR CITIZENS WALKING AROUND WITH HARD DRIVES
AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF THESE CABS AREN'T JUST NUMBERS THESE ARE GPS RECORDERS DRIVING AROUND IN OUR CITY STREETS RECORDING EACH AND EVERY
IT'S ON THE OTHER SIDE
AND THIS IS NOT THE KIND OF FACT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE BOASTED IN A CITY REPORT RIGHT
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE FRONT PAGE ON NYC
THE GOAL WAS TO DEVELOP A PRICE GUIDE A REAL DATA DRIVEN VIEW OF THE MARKET
SOMEONE IS MAKING THE RULES
BY LAST COUNT THERE WERE 48 DIFFERENT ONLINE MARKETS THAT I KNOW OF
I LOST BALLS ALL THE TIME
SHE WAS AFRAID SOMETHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO HIM
I COULDN'T REBOUND
I FELT UNWANTED
WE WERE MORE FLEXIBLE
EVEN THOUGH HE WAS FROM SERBIA HE WAS A MUSLIM
THEN WE GO TO REPAIR
THIS IS VERY UNLIKE HIM
AND I CAN TRACE ALL OF MY BIGGEST WINS AND ALL OF MY BIGGEST DISASTERS AVERTED
I WENT FROM DECIDING TO FULL BLOWN PLANNING VERY QUICKLY
ANY FURTHER OUT IT STARTS TO SEEM INTANGIBLE
I SENT HIM A TEXT A FEW WEEKS AGO ASKING HIM HAD HE EVER READ ANY STOIC PHILOSOPHY
HE AND HIS WIFE HAD TO FLEE POLAND BOUNCE FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY UNTIL THEY LANDED IN THE US WITH NEXT TO NOTHING
WHAT MIGHT BE THE BENEFITS OF SAY A BASE HIT
HE LOST HIS CAREER AS A FIREFIGHTER
HE WAS THEN THREATENED
FOR THE IRS BIT I COULD CHANGE THE MAILING ADDRESS ON FILE WITH THE IRS SO THE PAPERWORK WOULD GO TO MY ACCOUNTANT
IT RUNS IN MY FAMILY
THIS DECREASES EMOTIONAL REACTIVITY WHICH CAN BE A SUPERPOWER
I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS DOING
THOUGH I EVENTUALLY CAME TO THE REALIZATION THAT I NEEDED TO RAISE THIS COMPANY ON MY OWN
AS DAUNTING AS IT MAY BE IT'S ABOUT DOING SOMETHING BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU'VE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE
I HAD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT
WE ALL WANT LOVE
WE WOULD RETIRE AND I WOULD GO OFF INTO THE SUNSET MAYBE DO MINISTRY FULL TIME LOVE MY WIFE A LONG TIME
THAT'S A GREAT ARM PROTECTION
WE ALL WANT RESPECT FOR ONE ANOTHER
BECAUSE WE HAVE THE SAME GOAL WE ALL WANT PEACE
AND I BELIEVE WE ARE BACK ON THAT ROAD AND I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT IT
FORTY YEAR CRIME LOW SO MUCH SO I HAD OTHER COMMANDERS CALL ME HEY MEL WHATCHA DOIN' MAN
SO I'M VERY EXCITED NOW
YOU KNOW WHAT
AND SO THAT'S THE REASON FOR ME SEVERAL YEARS AGO
I WAS JUST SO TIRED
THE SECOND HALF WAS JUST ONE BIG NAP PRETTY MUCH IN CLASS
GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE MY NAME IS ZAHER BARAKY I'M HERE STUDYING MY EXECUTIVE MBA AT ECOLE H TELI RE
PEOPLE COMING FROM THE SAME LOCAL COMMUNITY FROM THE SAME BACKGROUND FROM THE SAME STRUGGLES
WITHIN THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS 30000 MORE FUTURE RESIDENTS WILL OUTLIVE THEIR PARENTS THEIR PRIMARY
THAT WOULDN'T STOP MY GRANDPARENTS FROM TRYING TO GIVE HIM A MEANINGFUL LIFE EVEN THOUGH THERE WEREN'T
HOW DO WE DISRUPT THIS
JUST BY ASKING THAT SIMPLE QUESTION OF WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE A MAN
I AM FINE I AM WITHIN THAT CONCEPT
I WAS KIND OF CAUGHT IN LIMBO
MY NERVES TOOK OVER EVERYTHING
REGARDLESS WHEN WE REVEAL OUR AUTHENTIC SELVES WE CREATE A TRUSTING WORLD A WORLD WHERE IT FEELS
SEE IT'S THAT YOU'RE LIKE ME MOMENT A MOMENT OF CONNECTION OF EMPATHY OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF A
I WAS TRYING TO ESCAPE HIM AND HERE HE WAS LAUGHING AT MY STUPIDITY SHOUTING OBSCENITIES AT
SO I QUIETLY LIVED IN MY CAR IN MY SHAME AND THEN LIVED IN MY SHAME FOR YEARS
WE HELP VICTIMS BECOME SURVIVORS AND OUR COMMUNITY CAN RESPOND TO OUR NEEDS IN A PROFOUND
THINK ABOUT THAT
WHAT HAPPENED AFTER MY SPEECH THAT DAY WAS THE ONES LIKE ME CAME OUT OF THE WOODWORK
I WAS A WORK IN PROGRESS NOT TO BE HELD TO THE TIMELINE OF SOMEONE ELSE'S ACCOMPLISHMENT
WHAT I REALIZED WAS THAT DENYING THE DARK PARTS OF MY HISTORY I WAS SUPPRESSING A PART OF ME THAT MATTERED AND A PART THAT
SO I DID IT
THAT WAS MY FIRST MOMENT OF AUTHENTICITY ABOUT MY PAST
YOU MIGHT WONDER WHAT I DID ONCE I ESCAPED
BUT IT WASN'T THAT TIME
YOU BECOME A MEMBER OF A GROUP THAT HAS TRULY SURVIVED
YOU COULD HAVE LIVED WITH US
THERE'S NO CENTRALIZED BANK
IT HAS SOME WAY TO GO IN TERMS OF USABILITY AND IN PARTICULAR WITH STORING AND KEEPING BITCOIN
THIS IS GOING TO OBLITERATE TODAY'S BANKING
BUT THIS IS GOING TO CHANGE
WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT BITCOIN
I SENT A VALUE OF A CUP OF COFFEE
BUT THEY'RE NOT USING COURTS THEY'RE USING SELF ARBITRATING CONTRACTS WITH ETHEREUM TECHNOLOGY
IT ROUGHLY DOUBLES THE PROFIT MARGIN
AND THAT'S IT
THIS IS A MATTER OF SEEING THAT TECHNOLOGIES IN THE PIPELINE ARE ACTUALLY OUTCOMPETING THE GOVERNMENT AND THE CORE
IT WAS RIDICULOUS
WHO OWNS THAT FORTUNE
EARLY 2011 IT WAS KIND OF LIMITED
YOU CAN BUY THAT WITH BITCOIN TODAY
WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY THE FIRST IDEA YOU GET WHEN YOU CREATE SOMETHING RIGHT
BECAUSE I LOVE SEEING MY NAME ON TWITTER ESPECIALLY WHEN I SAY SOMETHING DUMB THAT'S FUNNY
SO A BIT OF MY BACKGROUND
THERE'S A SMALL ASTERISK THERE
AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW
YOU PASS THOUSANDS OF CARS TO AND FROM WHEREVER YOU ARE GOING EVERY DAY
NOW THIS IS WHAT WE CALL THE THINKING MINDSET
IT INFLUENCES HOW WE APPROACH CHALLENGING OR PROBLEMATIC SITUATIONS OR TO HOW WE COMMUNICATE TO OTHERS BUT
I MEAN THAT'S YOUR BELIEF
BETWEEN WHAT BRAIN SCIENCE KNOWS AND WHAT PEOPLE DO AND WHAT BUSINESSES DO
AND WHAT HAPPENS THEN
NOW OTHER COGNITIVE OR HIGHER THINKING SKILLS THAT CHARACTERIZE THIS MINDSET ARE
IF THE SECOND GATEKEEPER TENDS TO TAG POSITIVE OR CONSTRUCTIVE MEANING TO THAT RAW FEELING IT
WE USE A NUMBER OF FILTERS ON THESE THINGS
EMOTIONALLY INSTEAD OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT OUR EMOTIONS ARE TELLING US WE BECOME HIJACKED BY THOSE SAME EMOTIONS WE
WHAT WE'RE LEFT WITH ARE CHOICES THAT TEND TO BE IRRATIONAL AND REACTIVE IN NATURE
AND THAT'S IF WE EVEN CAN MAKE CHOICES BECAUSE A LOT OF THE TIMES WE BECOME INDECISIVE WE JUST
WHAT IS THE HIDDEN STRUCTURE UNDERLYING THE GEOMETRY OF SPACE TIME WHICH WAS SMOOTH
IS THERE SOMETHING BELOW IT THAT WE ARE NOT SEEING NOT EXPERIENCING BUT WHICH ACTUALLY HOLDS THE WHOLE THING
I WANT TO EXPLAIN TO YOU ACTUALLY WHAT THIS THEORY IS
WHAT IS THE HIDDEN STRUCTURE
MUCH BEFORE WE ACTUALLY KNEW REALLY OF THE EXISTENCE OF ATOMS
THAT IS A BLACK HOLE
I WILL TELL YOU WHAT A BLACK HOLE IS
SO THEY FALL IN THE SAME WAY INDEPENDENT OF THEIR MASS
THAT'S A GREAT LAW OF NATURE
TO ONE PART IN 10 10 ACTUALLY
IT'S NOT THAT I'LL DO SOMETHING HERE AND THEN THIS RESPONSE
SO THEY DECIDED TO CALL IT OIL SANDS
IN FORT CHIPEWYAN THE 800 PEOPLE THERE ARE FINDING TOXINS IN THE FOOD CHAIN THIS HAS BEEN SCIENTIFICALLY
THAT'S NOT A BAD SIZE HOME
AND THE ATHABASCA RIVER DRAINS DOWNSTREAM TO A RANGE OF ABORIGINAL COMMUNITIES
THIS MIGHT BE WHAT
THANK YOU SO MUCH
THE OTHER METHOD OF EXTRACTION IS WHAT'S CALLED THE IN SITU
NOW YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD ABOUT THE PORCUPINE CARIBOU HERD IN THE CONTEXT OF ITS BREEDING GROUND IN ARCTIC NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE
WELL THE WINTERING GROUND IS ALSO CRITICAL AND IT ALSO IS NOT PROTECTED AND IS POTENTIALLY
I DID THE MATH
I LOVE THAT STORY
INSTEAD I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO AT LEAST SOMEHOW THE YEAR OF THE INSURANCE
JAMES WANTED TO USE BUS RAPID TRANSPORT FOR THAT RATHER THAN LIGHT RAIL
IN THE 1930S HARRY BECK APPLIED THE PRINCIPLES OF
SO THAT'S WHAT I DID
IT'S ESSENTIALLY THIS VIRTUAL MAP THAT ONLY EXISTS IN YOUR BRAIN
ALL ANIMAL SPECIES DO IT EVEN THOUGH WE ALL USE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TOOLS
MAYBE YOU'VE HAD THAT EXPERIENCE AS WELL
HAVE YOU HEARD OF THIS
AS IMPROVISERS WE TRAIN OURSELVES TO LISTEN WHOLLY TO LISTEN WITH THE WILLINGNESS TO
BUT THE PROBLEM IS WHEN FEAR IS THE PRIMARY REACTION THAT WE TEACH AND ENCOURAGE IN GIRLS WHENEVER
NOW THE ANSWER BEGAN TO COME WHEN A FRIEND OF MINE LAMENTED TO ME THAT HER YOUNG DAUGHTER WAS A BIG SCAREDY CAT
MOST OF WHAT THEY SAID TO HER WHEN SHE WAS OUTSIDE BEGAN WITH BE CAREFUL WATCH OUT
I WAS GETTING OUTSIDE MY COMFORT ZONE I WAS CALLING UPON MY RESILIENCE AND I WAS FINDING
SO ONE DAY A CALL CAME IN FOR A FIRE AND SURE ENOUGH WHEN MY ENGINE GROUP PULLED UP THERE WAS BLACK SMOKE BILLOWING
AND I WAS WITH A BIG GUY NAMED SKIP AND HE WAS ON THE NOZZLE AND I WAS RIGHT BEHIND AND IT
AND SOME OF THE IMPLICATIONS ARE QUITE AMAZING
BY THE WAY WE'RE NOT PATHOLOGIZING PEOPLE TO WHOM WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS
90 PERCENT OF CANCERS ARE CURABLE IF CAUGHT IN STAGE ONE
95 PERCENT IN SOME CASES
IF WE CAN'T DO IT OURSELVES OR SEE IT BEING DONE YOU'RE HARD PRESSED TO MAKE US BELIEVE
IT DISCOVERED THE HIGGS BOSON A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO
THIS IS WHY IT'S A BIG MYSTERY IN PHYSICS
WHAT IS DARK MATTER FOR INSTANCE
WE THINK THAT ANTIMATTER DID PLAY A VERY IMPORTANT PART MUCH EARLIER IN THE
IN A SENSE WE ARE THE LEFTOVERS OF THOSE LAST COLLISIONS
THIS DETECTOR MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR US TO ISOLATE THE SAMPLES OF MATTER AND ANTIMATTER THAT WE NEED TO
IT'S A REALLY BIG PROBLEM
AND SO FAR WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING UNTOWARD
WELL WE'VE MADE MEASUREMENTS OF MATTER WE'VE MADE MEASUREMENTS OF ANTIMATTER AND AS I'VE SAID WE DON'T HAVE A THEORY THAT
HOW DOES GRAVITY BEHAVE AT VERY SMALL SCALES
IT'S AN EXPERIMENT CALLED LHCB AND WE WORK ON THIS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LIVERPOOL
UNLESS WE KNOW THIS THERE'S NO WAY OF UNDERSTANDING HOW THE UNIVERSE GOT FROM THE BIG BANG TO NOW
WE HAVEN'T BY ANY MEANS LOOKED AT THE FULL DATA SET YET
WE DON'T HAVE A THEORY THAT PREDICTS IT OR THAT DESCRIBES ITS BEHAVIOUR TO US
AND I SAY AT LEAST BECAUSE THEY'RE SO SMALL WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY BEEN ABLE TO MEASURE THEIR SIZE
THEY DON'T DIFFER BY VERY MUCH
SO IF I HAVE A QUARTER OF A GRAM OF NORMAL MATTER MEETING A QUARTER OF A GRAM OF
AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THIS ENABLES US TO LOOK AT THE UNIVERSE IN A REGIME WHERE WE HAVE NEVER
WE WITNESSED THE ERUPTION OF VIOLENCE IN THE STREETS
AND I ASKED ONE OF THE VOTERS I SAID WHOM ARE YOU GOING TO VOTE FOR
I MEAN AT THE ABSOLUTE TIME FOR THE ABSOLUTE NEED OF DEMOCRACY THEY DID NOT ABUSE THEIR POWER
AND HE SAID I'M SORRY I CAN'T TELL YOU
I WANTED TO DOCUMENT ON FILM THE 2008 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS
NOW IN 1957 GHANA WAS THE FIRST SUB SAHARAN COUNTRY TO GAIN ITS INDEPENDENCE
AND THEY HAD TRAVELED FROM NEAR THEY HAD TRAVELED FROM FAR BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO MAKE THEIR VOICES HEARD
THAT WON'T WORK
SO THIS ONE IS THE REAL ONE
THOSE NEUTRONS HIT THE WALL OF THE MACHINE
BUT YOU HAVE TO COMPARE THAT TO THE COST OF MAKING MOORE'S LAW
NOW YOU SAY THAT'S NOT MUCH USE BUT IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY CLOSE CONSIDERING WE CAN GET ABOUT 10000 TIMES MORE THAN WE
NOW THAT'S NOT QUITE GOOD ENOUGH BECAUSE THE LASER TO PUT THAT ENERGY IN WAS MORE ENERGY THAN THAT BUT IT
ENTER DETROIT VEGAN SOUL
THEY NEVER GAVE UP
THEY ALWAYS KEPT FIGHTING
NO I'M GOING TO TAKE THAT BACK
5 MILLION DOLLARS AND THEY PROVIDED 252 JOBS
THEY HELD ON TO HOPE
WELL AT THE SAME TIME I WAS STILL RUNNING MY BLOG
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE WE AS HUMAN BEINGS HAVE A RIGHT TO PRODUCTS THAT ARE SAFE FOR OUR HOMES AND OUR BODIES
NOW ZERO WASTE THAT'S A PRETTY BIG IDEA
I ONLY HAVE WHAT I REALLY NEED
THE SECOND WAS PRODUCT PACKAGING AND SO I LEARNED HOW TO MAKE ALL OF MY OWN PRODUCTS
IT'S MORE POWERFUL
THIS IS A POEM ABOUT MARK ANTONY
YOU KNOW THEY SAY THAT THE INTERNET DEMOCRATIZES INFORMATION
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
I MEET SO MANY OF THESE PARENTS IT'S THE MOST HEARTBREAKING PART OF MY JOB
WE'RE MARCHING ACROSS THE COUNTRY STATE BY STATE MARRIAGE EQUALITY STYLE
FOR SOMEBODY LIKE ME WATCHING PEOPLE WAVE AROUND THEIR NEGATIVE NRA
WHAT DO HUNTERS WANT
WELL THEY WANT TO HUNT
THEY LOVE THEIR GUNS
THAT'S KIND OF INTERESTING
THE REASON I CAN BORROW HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
WHEN I WAS NINE YEARS OLD I CROSSED AND WENT TO MY RICH DAD'S OFFICE BEING AN ENTREPRENEUR HE STARTED TEACHING HIS
BUT IT WAS A GREAT LEARNING EXPERIENCE
YOU CAN'T LEARN TO RIDE A BICYCLE UNTIL YOU FALL OFF THE BICYCLE
I WENT HOME AND ASKED DAD I SAID HEY DAD
THEN THEY ARE TURNING PRO
THAT'S A LIE
SO ALL OVER THE WORLD TODAY I ASKED WHAT DR
NOW YOU HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL TO BE A DOCTOR A LAWYER AN ENGINEER BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL TO BE RICH
THEY BAILED OUT THE RICH
YOU MAKE MISTAKES YOU'RE CONSIDERED STUPID
WE'RE JUST LITTLE PEOPLE IN MANY WAYS
THIS IS FINANCIAL LITERACY
HOW DO YOU UNDERSTAND NUMBERS
THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT IS WHEN THEY LEAVE SCHOOL EVEN COLLEGE GRADUATES
I SAID WHY NOT
I SAID I DON'T WANT A JOB
WENT TO STANFORD THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO NORTHWESTERN
EVERY TIME YOU SAY YOU CAN'T AFFORD IT AND YOU SAY I'M A POOR I'M A LOSER I CAN'T DO SOMETHING I'M HELPLESS THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD TAKE
SO A PERSON HAS GOT TO FIND A PLACE TO MAKE MISTAKES
IT'S AVAILABLE 24 7 FOR FREE AND PROFESSIONAL COUNSELORS ARE HAPPY TO HOOK PEOPLE UP WITH THE SERVICES THEY
THESE ARE PRECISELY THE SAME ORGANIZATIONS THAT MOST OF US TRUST WHEN IT COMES TO OTHER IMPORTANT SCIENTIFIC
FARMERS THERE CANNOT AFFORD THE SEED
THAT'S BECAUSE THESE INSECTICIDE SPRAYS ARE DIFFICULT TO FIND THEY'RE EXPENSIVE AND THEY DON'T PREVENT THE INSECT
LET'S CELEBRATE SCIENTIFIC INNOVATION AND USE IT
FOR EXAMPLE THE SEED THAT'S BEING DISTRIBUTED THE FLOOD TOLERANT RICE THIS IS DISTRIBUTED FREELY
THERE'S NO ORGANIC METHOD
THESE SEEDS ARE NOT BEING SOLD
THIS IS THE HEROIN STRATEGY
MORE THAN HALF WILL DIE
THE REASON IS THAT SOMETIMES IT'S THE CHEAPEST SAFEST AND MOST EFFECTIVE TECHNOLOGY
THERE'S NO CONVENTIONAL METHOD
BUT THIS APPROACH DOES NOT WORK WELL IN BANGLADESH
SO THE MORE PEOPLE EXPERIMENT WITH MATERIALS THE MORE RESEARCHERS ARE WILLING TO SHARE
BUT THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE
BUT NOW THE MAKER COMMUNITY AND THE OPEN SOURCE MODEL ARE BRINGING THIS KIND OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HOW
WELL FIRST OF ALL BECAUSE I AM A MAKER
THE OBJECTS WE USE THE CLOTHES WE WEAR THE HOUSES WE LIVE IN ALL HAVE A PROFOUND
SO MANY TIMES AMATEURS NOT EXPERTS HAVE BEEN THE INVENTORS AND IMPROVERS
ONE DAY I WAS DRIVING HOME FROM WORK LISTENING TO THE RADIO AND I REMEMBER LISTENING TO ALL THESE
AND THIS IS THE IMPORTANT STEP
THAT'S YOUR JOB
THINK ABOUT IT WHAT'S YOUR GOAL
WHY IS THIS RIVER ORANGE
KNOW THAT PETTY RULES STIFLE CURIOSITY AND CREATIVITY SO HAVE LESS RULES AND
I TAKE THAT JOB SERIOUSLY I WORRY 24 7
OR YOU WRITE AN ESSAY AND YOU TELL ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE DONE WITH IT
AND TO MENTOR KIDS SO THAT EVENTUALLY THEY CAN DIRECT THEIR OWN LEARNING
WE SAID IF IT WAS EASY EVERYBODY WOULD BE DOING IT
NOW IT'S TIME TO PUT THEM TO USE
YOUR JOB IS TO UNCOVER YOUR CHILD'S TALENTS AND HELP THEM DEVELOP THEM AND HELP
OH MY GOSH THIS IS GREAT
HE LOVED THE HISTORY THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND POLITICAL ISSUES BEHIND IT AND THE CHEMISTRY
OR YOU WANT TO WRITE VIDEO ABOUT YOUR PROJECT AND ITS IMPACT
TAKE THE TIME TO HELP YOUR KID DISCOVER WHAT HE'S GREAT AT
AND WE PRAISED THE EFFORT WE PRAISED THE PROCESS AND NOT THE RESULT
I TALK TO A LOT OF PARENTS IN THE U
AND IF YOU WANT TO DO EVEN BETTER THEN YOU SHOW UP WITH A GOAL
BECAUSE THEN YOU'RE MOTIVATED TO IMPROVE FOR THE NEXT TIME AND YOU'RE INSPIRED BY THE OTHER PEOPLE'S
BECAUSE IF YOU LIVE IN THE BOX IT'S REALLY HARD TO THINK OUTSIDE OF IT
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
WHAT DO I HAVE TO TALK ABOUT
I'M A PROUD MOM
ESPECIALLY NOW MY OLDEST SON IS OFF TO UNIVERSITY
SO TAKE THE TIME TO RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUR KIDS
NOBODY DIED FROM LOSING
BUT SCIENTISTS SHOULD SURELY BE PRECAUTIONARY ABOUT EXPERIMENTS THAT GENERATE CONDITIONS WITHOUT
AND DON'T GET ME WRONG MAPPING APPS ARE THE GREATEST GAME CHANGER FOR ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO
YOU TAKE YOUR PHONE OUT AND YOU KNOW IMMEDIATELY WHERE TO GO
HOWEVER THE APP ALSO ASSUMES THERE ARE ONLY A HANDFUL OF DIRECTIONS TO THE
SO IT'S A VERY LOW PRESSURE ON THE SURFACE
WHERE DO WE COME FROM
THERE ARE SO MANY REALLY STRANGE THINGS OUT THERE
SO WE KNOW AN EXTREME EXAMPLE
AS A MATTER OF FACT NEAR THE END OF OUR TRAVELS IN EACH COUNTRY WE WERE CONFIDENTLY ABLE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH
TELL THEM THAT YOU KNOW EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE NOT TOO GREAT AT THE LANGUAGE YET YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO USE GOOGLE TRANSLATOR AND DICTIONARY A LOT IN
SO IF YOU WERE TO BUMP IN THEM AT THE WATER COOLER AND YOU WANT TO MAKE SMALL TALK AND YOU WANT TO SAY LET'S SAY YOU WERE BUSY AT WORK
HOWEVER IF YOU WERE TO PUSH THROUGH THIS ZONE AND GET TO THE SECOND ZONE SUDDENLY SWIMMING BECOMES A LOT
AND THAT'S SIMPLY NOT TRUE
IF YOU'RE TRYING TO LEARN SPANISH AND YOU HAVE A CO WORKER OR COLLEAGUE THAT SPEAKS SPANISH
IF YOU GO TO THE COUNTRY AND YOU DON'T YET SPEAK THE LANGUAGE WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
BUT I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THE BEAUTY OF THE NO ENGLISH RULE IS THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
IT'S ONLY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT REACHING NATIVE LIKE LEVELS OF PRONUNCIATION AND GRAMMAR WHERE CHILDREN START TO SHOW AN UPPER HAND
AND AFTER A YEAR OF LIVING IN FRANCE AND PUSHING MYSELF TO STUDY EVERY SINGLE DAY I DID GET TO A POINT WHERE I
AND WE FOUND THAT THIS NO ENGLISH RULE WORKED INCREDIBLY WELL
THAT'S MOST OF YOU HERE
AND CONTRAST THAT TO THAT OF MY MORE RECENT EXPERIENCE IN SPAIN
ACTUALLY MAKING MISTAKES IS VERY GOOD BECAUSE IT MEANS YOU'RE USING THE LANGUAGE AND EVENTUALLY IT HELPS YOU TO GAIN THE
IDEALLY THE WAY YOU'D DO THIS IS YOU'D MOVE TO THE COUNTRY THAT SPEAKS THIS LANGUAGE AND GO
THE FIRST ONE
EVERY TIME I SEE THIS PERSON I KNOW IT IS PRACTICE TIME THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT NOW I HAVE TO SPEAK SPANISH
SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE A SHORT VIDEO THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SHOW YOU THAT CAPTURES THE KIND OF PROGRESS THAT WE WERE ABLE
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN
AND HOW DO YOU SAY THIS
ONCE AGAIN IT IS NOT SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO BE PERFECT AT
SO REMEMBER THAT THE WHOLE GOAL OF THIS PROCESS AND THIS METHOD IS TO PUSH PAST THIS ZONE OF
SO EVERY TIME YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THEM YOU ONLY COMMIT TO SPEAKING IN SPANISH
ARE YOU GOING TO RELY ON OTHER EXPATS AND LOCALS WHO SPEAK ENGLISH TO HELP YOU TO GET BY
BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WHAT IS THE MAIN ISSUE THAT IS HOLDING EVERYBODY BACK FROM
IT PROVIDES MOTIVATION AND AN OPPORTUNITY FOR IMMERSION
COMMIT TO THE NO ENGLISH RULE WITH THIS PERSON
BUT IT'S NOT THE ANSWER TO ALL OF YOUR PROBLEMS
AND WHAT THIS REALLY HELPS YOU TO DO IS THAT IT HELPS YOU OUT WITH TWO REALLY IMPORTANT THINGS
AND IN CHINA AND IN KOREA BECAUSE CHINESE AND KOREAN ARE SO MUCH HARDER THAN THE EUROPEAN LANGUAGES
ALL I HEARD WAS HE WAS ACCUSED OF RAPE
BUT I UNDERSTAND THEIR MINDSET
THEY'RE ALL LYING ABOUT BEING ABUSED
AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED TO ME
I WAS TOLD THAT MEN'S RIGHTS ACTIVISTS WERE AGAINST WOMEN'S EQUALITY
IT'S ALL A SCAM
SO I'M ASKING QUESTIONS AND I'M GETTING THEIR FULL LIFE STORY
THE GROUND ZERO OF THE WAR ON WOMEN
I DON'T THINK SO
WHAT IS FOOD JUSTICE 2
EAT MOSTLY PLANTS
I'M LIKE YES I GOT THAT
I WANT THEM TO KNOW THAT I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN THEM
THERE ARE TWO MAYOR REASONS FOR THAT
IT HATES STATUS QUO AND IT HATES AUTOMATIC PILOT
AND IT'S WHERE YOU TAKE INFORMATION IN FROM ALL THE SOURCES BLEND IT WITH THE RICH KNOWLEDGE THAT'S
GET OFF OF AUTOMATIC PILOT
BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO HAPPEN
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU STRATEGIES AND I CALL THEM BRAIN POWERS
THE BRAIN POWER OF ONE
THAT'S OK THIS IS WHAT THE LUNCH CHALLENGE IS ABOUT
BUT EACH TIME YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU WANT FOR LUNCH YOU'RE PRACTICING THE STEPS THAT TOGETHER REVEAL YOUR BIGGER
WHAT DO YOU WANT
THAT GAP BETWEEN LACK AND FULFILMENT IS UNCONFORTABLE
BUT IT'S THE DISCOMFORT THAT MOVES US FORWARD
ONE TIME I ASKED HER WHAT HER FAVORITE COLOR WAS
WE NEED SHELTER AND LOVE
AND THIS IS A GREAT AND NECESSARY THING BUT MOST OF THAT ATTENTION HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON A VERY FEW
WE NEED CLEAN WATER TO DRINK
AND MEANWHILE OUR TRANS CHILDREN SUFFER
AND MORE THAN HALF OF THEM AREN'T EVEN AWARE OF IT
CAN WE CHANGE THAT
IT'S NOT THE RITZ CARLTON
THEY WILL PROVIDE THE FUNDS
LET'S SEE BY A SHOW OF HANDS
THEY'VE TRIED THIS ACTUALLY
IN DALLAS TEXAS THEY HAVE A PROGRAM THAT OFFERS EIGHT YEAR OLDS TWO DOLLARS FOR EACH BOOK THEY
AND LET'S SAY IT'S A FOUNDATION
THERE'S PROBABLY A BREAKTHRU COMING HERE
I BELIEVE THAT MUSIC HAS POWER TO GIVE PEOPLE HOPE AND TO HELP THEM FEEL
I LOVE THAT AND I ALWAYS TRY TO REMEMBER THAT WHEN I SIT DOWN TO PLAY
WHY AM I GOING TO ASK A QUESTION ABOUT THIS RANDOM THING WHEN I HAVE STATS HOMEWORK TO DO
AND I FIND THIS REALLY SAD BECAUSE WHEN A CHILD ASKS A QUESTION THEY CAN'T NECESSARILY UNDERSTAND THE ANSWER
AND IT'S NOT A SHAMEFUL THING NOT TO KNOW SOMETHING
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT OR ASK QUESTIONS
BECAUSE WE RIGHT NOW CAN ONLY REACH FOR THE STARS BUT MAYBE ONE DAY THEY WILL BE ABLE TO
AND THEY CAN'T NECESSARILY GO OUT AND SEARCH FOR THAT ANSWER AND UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY FIND
THEY WERE IN THE CENTER OF STARS THAT MADE THIS UNIVERSE
WE HAVE JOBS WE HAVE SCHOOL WE HAVE HOMEWORK
AND IT BECAME MORE MATURE
TO FIND THE BABY JESUS THE MAGI FOLLOWED A STAR
THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SPACE
WRONG IN EDINBURGH
HOW OLD ARE THEY
AND THAT BECOMES THE EXPLANATION
AND YOUR GRANDMOTHER
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
AND WHAT PERMISSION DO YOU HAVE TO BE BRIGHT
BLAH BLAH BLAH
THAT ARE PARTICULARLY LOOKED AT NOT DUE TO THE TEST BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE CORRELATES OF INTELLIGENCE
IT'S THE VERY LATEST STUDY I DOWNLOADED IT THIS AFTERNOON I HAVEN'T YET READ IT
THE WOMEN'S PERSONALITY WITH THE SLIGHTLY LOWER SELF ESTEEM WITH SLIGHTLY MORE ANXIOUSNESS MEANS THAT WHEN THEY'RE TAKING
I AM MY TEACHER'S FIRST MALE STUDENT IN A TRADITION UNDERSTOOD BY MANY AS FEMALE AND I
AND HOW FAST HAS THIS HAPPENED
WE HAVE ALL THIS AT THE SAME TIME
IT WILL NEVER AFFECT A RICH PERSON
YOU CAN WATCH ME FOR ONE MINUTE NOW AND YOU'LL SEE THE WHOLE THING
AND ASIA COULD HAVE SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT BEFORE THEY GOT THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
DON'T MAKE IT A RACE ISSUE
AND WHEN IT COMES TO FREE DATA AND TRANSPARENCY UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS ONE OF THE BEST
QUITE THE OPPOSITE OF THE WORLD BANK WHO COMPILED DATA WITH GOVERNMENT MONEY TAX MONEY AND THEN
MAKE IT A LOCAL ISSUE
THAT HAS NOW DISAPPEARED AND THEY ARE NOW IN GREAT ECONOMIC PROBLEM
AND WE HAVE A HIGH HOPE IN YOU
DON'T MAKE IT AFRICA
THAT'S WHY IT'S SO PROBLEMATIC TO DESCRIBE WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THIS IS NOT THE STATE DEPARTMENT
BECAUSE IN FACT THIS IS CHILD LABOR
BECAUSE AFTER ALL TALKING ABOUT THE DEVELOPING WORLD IS LIKE HAVING TWO CHAPTERS IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES
THE LAST CHAPTER IS ABOUT PRESENT AND PRESIDENT OBAMA AND THE OTHER IS ABOUT THE PAST WHERE YOU
DOES YOUR MINDSET CORRESPOND TO MY DATASET
AND ONE WEEK AGO FOR THE FIRST TIME THERE WERE FOUR LINES ON THE INTERNET
DON'T DO IT ALONE
THE ONLY CONSTANT IN LIFE IS REALLY CHANGE
BUT NOW DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY NATIONS HAVE A PRESIDENT
A HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN
WHAT DO YOU CALL THE LEADER OF A REPUBLICAN COUNTRY
AND THIS WAS DEBATED IN CONGRESS FOR AGES AND AGES
AND THAT TITLE
AND OVER THE COURSE OF NINE MONTHS I HAD THE CHANCE TO HAVE DOZENS OF CONVERSATIONS WITH LOW INCOME
SO I HAVE SPENT HOURS UPON HOURS TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF THIS WEIRD GROUNDHOG DAY
SO ON THE ONE HAND THIS IS JUST A BASIC RECODING OF THE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD
AND WE CHOSE TO USE THE PRESCRIPTION FOR THAT PURPOSE
AND WHEN THE OFFICE OF ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY IN WASHINGTON D
SO WE THOUGHT IF WE CAN GET INDIVIDUAL DOCTORS TO PRESCRIBE THESE BASIC RESOURCES FOR THEIR PATIENTS
SO IT'S A BRUTAL WINTER IN THE NORTHEAST YOUR KID HAS ASTHMA YOUR HEAT JUST GOT TURNED OFF AND OF COURSE YOU'RE IN THE WAITING ROOM OF THE
THIS ASPIRATION THAT OUR HEALTHCARE KEEP US HEALTHY IS AN ENORMOUSLY POWERFUL ONE
THE PROBLEM IS ONCE YOU GET A TASTE OF WHAT IT'S LIKE TO REALIZE YOUR ASPIRATION FOR HEALTHCARE YOU WANT
IT REQUIRES A NON CLINICAL ARMY OF COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS AND CASE MANAGERS AND MANY
SO THAT'S WHERE HEALTH LEADS BEGAN
I BELIEVE THAT WHEN WE MEASURE HEALTHCARE IT WILL BE NOT BY WHAT THE SYSTEM WAS BUT
THE REAL ISSUE IS THAT CHILD IS LIVING WITH 12 OTHER PEOPLE IN A TWO BEDROOM APARTMENT
THEY WILL BE USED TO REALIZE OUR ASPIRATION
SO HEALTH LEADS WAS BORN OF THESE CONVERSATIONS A SIMPLE MODEL WHERE DOCTORS AND NURSES CAN
MY BELIEF IS THAT IT'S ALMOST TOO PAINFUL TO ARTICULATE OUR ASPIRATIONS FOR OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM OR
BUT HE HASN'T PAID HIS RENT OF COURSE BECAUSE HE'S PAYING FOR HIS HIV MEDICATION AND JUST CAN'T AFFORD BOTH
SAME THING IN THE CLINIC WAITING ROOM
HERE WE ARE 45 YEARS AFTER GEIGER HAS PRESCRIBED FOOD FOR HIS PATIENTS AND I HAVE
YOU MUST PURSUE THAT VISION
THAT IF WE ARE HONEST WITH OURSELVES AND LISTEN QUIETLY THAT WE ALL
WE HAD MOMS WHO WOULD COME IN DAUGHTER HAS ASTHMA WAKES UP COVERED IN COCKROACHES EVERY MORNING
BUT IN MY WORLD IT'S CALLED REDUCED OBESITY AND DIABETES
AND THIS ISN'T JUST A SORT OF SHORT TERM WORKFORCE TO CONNECT PATIENTS TO BASIC RESOURCES IT'S A NEXT
THEY WILL BE USED FOR OUR PURPOSES
THE AVERAGE NCAA DIVISION I MEN'S BASKETBALL PLAYER DEDICATES 39 HOURS A WEEK TO
AND WE ALWAYS WON BECAUSE THE JUDGES WERE JUST SO GROSSED OUT
HEALTH JUST TAKES MORE TIME
WE'VE CREATED A PRESUMPTION THAT IF YOU'RE A PATIENT AT THAT HOSPITAL WITH AN ELEVATED BMI THE FOUR WALLS OF THE
IF WE KNOW WHAT IT TAKES TO HAVE A HEALTHCARE SYSTEM RATHER THAN A SICK CARE SYSTEM WHY DON'T WE
DO THEY HAVE TRANSPORTATION TO THE PHARMACY
WHICH WAS FUNDING GEIGER'S CLINIC FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS THEY WERE FURIOUS
GEIGER I KNEW I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE PROUD TO BE PART OF THIS HISTORY
I JUST WANTED A BLESSING I DIDN'T WANT SOME KIND OF MANDATE
AND ON THE OTHER HAND IT'S A RADICAL TRANSFORMATION OF THE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD FROM A
THESE THINGS ARE OURS
AND ONE OF OUR LITIGATION STRATEGIES WAS ACTUALLY TO SEND ME INTO THE HOME OF THESE CLIENTS WITH THESE LARGE GLASS
COLLEGE SPORTS TEAMS SAY WE'RE GOING TO TAKE DOZENS OF HOURS AT SOME FIELD ACROSS CAMPUS AT SOME
I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THE NEAREST FOOD PANTRY IS
BUT OVER THE COURSE OF THESE NINE MONTHS I GREW FRUSTRATED WITH FEELING LIKE WE WERE INTERVENING TOO FAR
BARRY ZUCKERMAN WAS DOING AS CHAIR OF PEDIATRICS AT BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER
SO OUR FEELING IS IF IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE RUGBY TEAM IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR HEALTH AND POVERTY
THOSE ARE THE QUESTIONS I LEARNED AT HEALTH LEADS NOT IN MEDICAL SCHOOL
YOU NEED MORE
THE DOCTORS IT SEEMED NEVER REALLY HAD ENOUGH TIME FOR ALL THE PATIENTS TRY AS THEY MIGHT
SO JUST A FEW MILES FROM HERE AT CHILDREN'S NATIONAL MEDICAL CENTER
AND THEY LEAVE WITH THE CONVICTION THE ABILITY AND THE EFFICACY TO REALIZE OUR MOST BASIC
IT'S JUST A SET OF CHOICES THAT PEOPLE MAKE
WHAT CAUSES DEPRESSION
YEAH I SAID IT
IT'S VERY HEAVILY DEPRESSANT
IT'LL SQUAT DOWN ON ITS HAUNCHES AND THE TREADMILL STARTS TO WEAR THE FUR AND THE SKIN RIGHT OFF ITS BACKSIDE
I CALL IT THE BRAIN'S RUNAWAY STRESS RESPONSE
I'M NOT SAYING THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY CHANGE SINCE THEN
THEY DON'T GET SHUT DOWN
LEFT UNCHECKED IT'S AN ILLNESS THAT CAN CAUSE BRAIN DAMAGE
I WAS NOT TRAINED AS A PSYCHOTHERAPIST AS AN INTERVENTIONIST RESEARCHER
A PRIMARY DRIVER
WORKING OUT WOULD BE CRAZY TO THEM
AND YOU KNOW WHAT HE FOUND
THEY REQUIRED WHAT
EXERCISE IS NOT NATURAL
THEY HAVE HIGH RATES OF INFANT MORTALITY
WE'RE BORN TO CONNECT
AND SO WE DESIGNED A NEW TREATMENT PROGRAM
BRISK WALKING YOU KNOW THE KIND
LIKE YOU MIGHT MISS YOUR PLANE
HERE'S THE THING I LOVE THOUGH
I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT THAT RESPONSE
THE FIGHT OR FLIGHT RESPONSE WAS DESIGNED PRIMARILY TO AID OUR ANCESTORS WHEN THEY
THE RESULT IS DEVASTATING
WHAT DID OUR ANCESTORS DO THAT PROTECTED THEM
FOR SOME YES
WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT IT
AND HERE'S THE PROBLEM
THE RATE OF DEPRESSION SEEMS TO BE INCREASING GENERATION AFTER GENERATION
YOU'VE HEARD OF THEM OMEGA 6S AND OMEGA 3S
SO EVERY SUCCESSIVE BIRTH COHORT IS HAVING HIGHER RATES OF DEPRESSION THAN THE ONE THAT
AND GUESS WHAT
I AM NOT ANTI MEDICATION
THAT SOUNDS AT BEST IMPOSSIBLE
WHILE AT WORST IT SOUNDS LIKE MANIPULATION
AND WE'VE MADE GREAT THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL ADVANCES IN HOW TO DEAL WITH HOW TO UNDERSTAND AND IN HOW
MAYBE WE HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT
IF THE INFLATIONARY CONSEQUENCES OF USING SDRS IN THIS WAY ARE BENIGN
THAT IS HOW IT WORKS
THEY GO OUT AND THEY FIND FACTS AND THEY ASSEMBLE THOSE FACTS AND THEY PROVIDE CONTEXT FOR THE
WE FIGHT VERY HARD TO AVOID IT BUT WE CANNOT SOMEHOW AVOID THE PERCEPTION OF
I GREW UP IN A HOME WHERE NEWS WAS IMPORTANT
INFORMATION REPORTED AFTER A RIGOROUS SERIES OF CHECKS AND BALANCES TO ENSURE ACCURACY AND
IS IT SOMETHING OUR AUDIENCE WANTS
MAYBE YOU DON'T APPROVE OF THE SOLUTIONS THEY'VE COME UP WITH MAYBE YOU THINK YOU WOULD'VE DONE IT A DIFFERENT WAY BUT THEY THINK THEY'RE DOING THE
THE GUYS I TALKED TO WERE NOT RACISTS BUT THEY WERE TRYING TO RECLAIM A RACIST SYMBOL
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO IT OURSELVES BECAUSE I'LL TELL YOU WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT ONE THING IS THAT MOST OF US AGREE ON
PEOPLE ARE BETTER THAN YOU THINK AND THEY'LL SURPRISE YOU
AND 1 IN 5 WOULD BE UNHAPPY IF SOMEONE FROM THE OTHER POLITICAL PARTY MARRIED INTO OUR
I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO BE TOLERANT OF EACH OTHER
TOLERANCE IS FOR COWARDS
SO WHAT YOU DO WITH ALL THAT EMOTION IS YOU'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING WITH IT
BECAUSE IT'S NOT THAT EASY TO GET RID OF FIVE DOLLARS
NOW SAVING IS A CLASSIC TWO SELVES PROBLEM
I MEAN LET'S FACE IT THE PRESENT SELF IS PRESENT
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE TOPIC OF SAVING
THE PRESENT SELF DOES NOT WANT TO SAVE AT ALL
IT WANTS TO CONSUME
IT'S IN CONTROL
AND NO MATTER WHAT I SAY YOU CANNOT UNTIE ME FROM THE MAST
IT'S PHYSICALLY POSSIBLE TO EXERCISE MORE
WE DON'T NEED A REASON
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
MAYBE SHE HAD BEEN DARED TO DO THIS
AND WE'RE NEVER GIVEN A REASON WHY WE SHOULD PLAY
NOW I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING WHERE WAS THE TEACHER
THE STUDENTS IN THE PEER CONNECTIONS PROGRAM AND SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES DESERVE EQUAL EDUCATION TO
NOW LET ME EXPLAIN
AS A PEER MENTOR I WAS ABLE TO SERVE AS A CLASSMATE TO JULIA A SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENT FOR THE
JULIA AND I WERE EQUALLY OVERWHELMED
AND IT'S A VERY SIMILAR THING
THEY ALL PLAY THEIR ROLE AND THEY INTERACT WITH THE SENSORY SYSTEMS AND ARE ABLE
SO WHAT THE BRAIN DOES IT KIND OF FILLS IN THAT GAP
SO LOUD NOISE EXPOSURE IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST RISKS
IN THIS CASE AGAIN THE BRAIN IS THE CAUSE FOR THIS
THERE WAS A STUDY BEFORE THAT SHOWED IF WE HEAR UNPLEASANT SOUNDS THE SAME REGION LIGHTS UP
SO IT MAKES SENSE THAT THIS REGION WAS AFFECTED BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW AT THE TIME HOW
IT MAY HAPPEN SOMETIMES WITH ACCIDENTS
ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THE BLIND SPOT IN YOUR EYE
SO MOST PEOPLE ACTUALLY EVEN AFTER EXTENSIVE LOUD NOISE EXPOSURE DON'T GET TINNITUS
HEARING LOSS IS THE SECOND MOST FREQUENT ONE
AND PART OF OUR RESEARCH IS AIMING FOR THAT OF COURSE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO
THAT WAS MY AHA
I CREATED MY OWN STORY
WE'RE GOING TO RECREATE THIS STORY
HE DOESN'T NEED ANY PREEXISTING MATERIALS TO FASHION A WORLD OUT OF
THEY DON'T EXIST OUTSIDE THE WORLD
AND I KNOW YOU FEEL IT
WHY DO YOU EXIST
AND BY THE WAY THIS IS WHAT MOST AMERICANS TODAY BELIEVE
THAT'S WHAT SCIENCE IS TELLING US
IT WAS TOWARDS THE END OF THE 17TH CENTURY THE PHILOSOPHER LEIBNIZ WHO ASKED IT A
AND INDEED I WOULD SAY THAT'S THE REALITY WE LIVE IN
HE CAN MAKE IT OUT OF SHEER NOTHINGNESS CREATION EX NIHILO
THEY CAN'T CALL A WORLD INTO EXISTENCE OUT OF NOTHINGNESS
HE SEES PHYSICAL LAWS AS BEING LIKE DIVINE COMMANDS
IT'S JUST A BIG COSMIC VACUITY
THAT'S A VERY PRIMITIVE VIEW OF WHAT A SCIENTIFIC LAW IS
WHAT BREATHES FIRE INTO THE EQUATIONS AND CREATES A WORLD FOR THEM TO DESCRIBE
THE FULLEST POSSIBLE REALITY THAT'S SPECIAL
SO MY CHOICES ARE MEANINGLESS
SO WE DON'T WANT TO LIVE IN THAT SPECIAL REALITY
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY ONTIC CLOUD OF THEIR OWN
GOD MADE IT
NOW IF YOU'RE A BUDDHIST YOU MIGHT WANT TO STOP RIGHT THERE BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY WHAT YOU'VE GOT IS
NOW WHAT'S IN BETWEEN THESE TWO EXTREMES
THAT'S THE COSMIC QUESTION IT SORT OF RHYMES WITH A MORE INTIMATE QUESTION WHY DO I EXIST
THAT'S HOW POWERFUL GOD IS
IT'S OBSESSED GREAT THINKERS
JOHN ARCHIBALD WHEELER ONE OF THE GREAT PHYSICISTS OF THE 20TH CENTURY THE TEACHER OF RICHARD FEYNMAN THE
BUT I WILL TELL YOU SOMETHING TO CONCLUDE THAT I GUARANTEE YOU WILL ASTONISH YOU BECAUSE IT'S ASTONISHED
AND I'VE NO DOUBT THERE ARE FIVE EINSTEINS IN THE AUDIENCE TONIGHT
DO WE WANT TO LIVE IN A SPECIAL REALITY
ALSO A YOUNGER PHYSICIST MAX TEGMARK WHO BELIEVES THAT ALL
KEEP IN MIND AS YOU'RE WATCHING IT THAT THERE ARE NO GRAPHICS IN THIS THERE ARE NO CGIS NO
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
ALL THIS SORT OF STUFF
AND SO THE WAY THAT IT WOUND UP WORKING OUT IS THERE IS THIS VERY MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL ARRANGEMENT WHERE THEY ESSENTIALLY
INSIDE THE ROLLS ROYCE IS THE QUEEN MOTHER
SHE WAVES AND SHE SMILES
I RESOLVED TO GIVE BACK
FIRST TRANSFER OF RESOURCES FROM RICH COUNTRIES IN THE NORTH TO POORER COUNTRIES IN THE
AND SO IT'S RELIABLE REAL DATA THAT'S RIGHT IN MY FACE WHERE I AM SO I CAN FINISH THE
BECAUSE WE GIVE THEM SO MUCH INFORMATION AND THEY ARE ENTITLED TO REALLY SEE HOW
AND WESTERN EUROPE IS EIGHT PERCENT
IT ALLOWS US TO ENGAGE IN REALLY NEW AND INTERESTING WAYS
THEY MADE IT FRESH
THEY MADE IT ASPIRATIONAL
AT THAT TIME I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO DO THAT AS I DO TODAY
MY DAD WAS A BAKER AND MY MOM WAS A HOUSEKEEPER
AND ONE SALARY WAS EXPECTED TO SUPPORT TEN PERSONS
MOST OF ITS STUDENTS ARE GIRLS
THE VAST MAJORITY ARE MEDIUM ACADEMIC ACHIEVERS AND THEY ARRIVE FROM FAMILIES WITH
I WAS BORN TO A POOR FAMILY
AND THE SAME APPLIES TO SOCIETY
WE'RE IN A SENSE A SUPERORGANISM
WE CAN ASK IT ABOUT OTHER THINGS AS WELL
WE WENT TO HARVARD AND WE CHECKED ALMOST EVERY DEPARTMENT AND IN FACT FROM HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL WHERE A FEW PEOPLE
HOW DO WE GET PEOPLE TO THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT INEQUALITY AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF INEQUALITY IN TERMS OF HEALTH
AND THE EXPENSIVE PAIN MEDICATION WORKED BETTER
WHAT ARE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A COUNTRY THAT WOULD MAKE YOU WANT TO JOIN IT KNOWING THAT YOU COULD END RANDOMLY
SO AT WAYNFLETE THEY START EACH SCHOOL YEAR OFF BY SENDING THE STUDENTS ON A BONDING TRIP
PASSPORTS LICENSES TAXES APPLICATIONS EVEN BATHROOMS
IT HAD BEEN SO EASY WHEN I WAS YOUNGER
I DIDN'T HAVE ANY SLEEPOVERS I DIDN'T VISIT ANY FRIENDS I WAS LIKE A GHOST
IN THOSE TWO YEARS OF BEING SO DILIGENT AT KEEPING MY SECRET I HAD ACTUALLY FORGOTTEN HOW TO COME OUT TO
WE DON'T GET TO FOCUS ON
AND SHE GAVE ME THE CONFIDENCE TO KEEP COMING OUT TO OTHER KIDS AT WAYNFLETE AS THE WEEKS WENT ON
YOU HAVE THE POWER TO EDUCATE OTHERS AND YOURSELF
MY NAME'S WYATT
AND I LATCHED ONTO THIS KID
AND THE BEST PART WAS MY PARENTS TOLD US THAT AT HIS NEW SCHOOL WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO HIDE ANYMORE
THIS WAS THE BEGINNING OF MY DAD REALLY TRYING TO COME AROUND TO ME BEING TRANSGENDER AND EVERYONE IN MY FAMILY HELPED
AND IT PUT NO STRAIN ON THE OTHER STUDENTS BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL USED INTO IT WITH ME
AFTER A FEW MONTHS OF ISOLATION I DECIDED TO START USING THE GIRLS' BATHROOM AGAIN OF MY OWN ACCORD
PLEASE KEEP THEM ON UNTIL I ASK YOU TO REMOVE THEM
DURING MY STUDY IT WAS CALLED A COOKBOOK FOR THE VISUAL IMPAIRED
IT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE WHETHER YOU'RE BLIND OR VISUALLY IMPAIRED
AND MAYBE JUST MAYBE THIS TED TALK WILL BE A ONE LITTLE STEP IN THAT
PERFECT FOR MY JACKET
HOW DO I SHAKE HANDS WITH PEOPLE WHO DO NOT SEE MY HAND COMING
THIS YEAR I'VE COMPLETED THE SEQUEL BAKING WITH FEELING
THEY'RE MADE FROM PLASTIC AND YOU CAN USE THEM IN THE GARDEN
MY FIRST QUESTION AGAIN THOSE PLASTIC PAGES
TRY IT IN A FUN WAY AND THINKING OF WHAT CAN I DO
OTHERWISE YOU MIGHT DAMAGE THE PAPER AND THE PAPER DOTS
FOR THE TIME BEING YOU'LL HAVE TO MAKE DUE WITH MY VOICE JUST LIKE THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED
IT WOULD NOW TELL ME AND YOU
MY IDEA WAS BORN
HOW DO BLIND PEOPLE READ
I STILL REMEMBER ONE OF THEM WITH A SMILE
BUT IT'S GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH NOT HELPING ANYONE IS SO MUCH MONUMENTALLY GREATER THAN ANY
YOU'RE READY TO BE DONE WITH ENDLESS DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENTS CHEMOTHERAPY AND SURGERIES AND YOU SHOULD BE
ANGER CAN MOTIVATE YOU
SO MUCH SO THAT NOT MAKING A CONSCIOUS EFFORT TO HELP OTHERS AND MAKE THIS WORLD A BETTER PLACE IS MORALLY
IN YOUR WILDEST DREAMS WHAT ARE ALL THE THINGS YOU WANT
YOU'VE BEEN PREPARING YOURSELF FOR THIS MOMENT YOUR ENTIRE LIFE
A BATTLE TO THE DEATH
AS LONG AS YOU HAVE A ONE IN ONE MILLION CHANCE YOU WILL FIGHT
THE ROMANS TALKED ABOUT THE FATHER OF THE FAMILY PATER
WE ALL KNOW THAT SMOKING IS BAD BUT IT WAS BACK IN THE 50S WHEN DOCTORS AND
WHEN THE SUPREME COURT MADE ITS JUDGMENT THEY SIDED WITH THE HOSPITAL AND THE STATE OF MISSOURI
IT'S GOING TO BE THE SAME FOR US WITH REGARD TO MEAT AND DAIRY PRODUCTS
YOU'RE SO WISE
AT A FAMILY GATHERING SHE HAD COME HOME FROM THE HOSPITAL AND WAS TELLING US THAT WHEN SHE WENT TO SEE HER
IN 1815 THE AVERAGE AMERICAN ATE ABOUT 5 POUNDS OF SUGAR IN A YEAR
WE LEARNED ABOUT THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION
SO WE LEARNED ABOUT THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE
BY THE WAY NOT EVERYONE STOPPED SMOKING
WE KNOW BEST
I CAME ACROSS SOME STATISTICS
AND THEY PRESENTED THE EVIDENCE TO THE COURT IN MISSOURI AND THE COURT AGREED THAT THIS WAS
WHICH THEY DID
WE OWE IT TO OUR FAMILIES
THAT CONCEPT OF FATHER KNOWS BEST HAS A LONG HISTORY
WE LEARNED ABOUT PEARL HARBOR AND D DAY
BUT THERE IS ANOTHER WAY OF LEARNING ABOUT HISTORY AND IT HAS TO DO WITH LOOKING AT THE SMALL
EVERY EPISODE WENT THE SAME WAY PRETTY MUCH
WE OWE IT TO OURSELVES
UNFORTUNATE ASSUMPTION NUMBER ONE IS
THEY TOLD HIM
DON'T QUIT YOUR DAY JOB
WELL ONCE I HAD A TASTE OF FEEDBACK I REALIZED I WANTED MORE BECAUSE IF I HAD ONE WAY OF BEING THAT WASN'T
SO I TOOK THIS ASSESSMENT CALLED THE EQ PROFILE AND ONE OF THE THINGS THE EQ PROFILE DOES IS IT
SO THIS IS HOW IT SHOWS UP FOR ME
A TESSERACT THAT WE'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH
BUT ONE OF THE PROFOUND THINGS THAT EINSTEIN SHOWED US IS WHEN YOU HAVE LIGHT
SO I CHALLENGE ALL OF YOU
IT TRULY FEELS LIKE A DREAM
THIS HAS BEEN MY DREAM
IT IS FARELY RARE AFFECTING ONLY 1 IN EVERY 50 THOUSAND PEOPLE WORLDWIDE
IN THAT 2 WEEK PERIOD HIGH LEVELS OF PHENYLALANINE COULD ALREADY BE DOING DAMAGE TO THEIR BODY
TO GET THE VOICES FROM THE FIELD HEARD IN PLACES FAR AWAY SO THOSE CONCERNS DON'T
THAT'S ONE OF THE ROLES THE UNITED NATIONS CAN PLAY
FOR EXAMPLE IN SUDAN WE WERE ABLE TO GET LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO EXPRESS THEIR
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE ROLE OF ORGANISATIONS IS SUPPOSED TO BE
THESE UNHEALTHY CULTURES THAT ARE FESTERING IN THESE GROUPS WHERE THE FOCUS IS ON MEETING REGULATIONS
I'M NOT SAYING EVERY SCIENTIST SHOULD BE AN ACTIVIST
THIS WAS SCIENCE IN SERVICE TO THE PUBLIC
IT WASN'T UNTIL I ARRIVED IN GRADUATE SCHOOL AND WITNESSED FIRSTHAND THE CRIMINAL ACTIONS OF
MY UNDERGRADUATE YEARS WERE EXPLICIT JOB PREPARATION AND I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW
THERE IS ALSO A GROWING CULTURE OF DISENGAGEMENT BETWEEN ENGINEERING STUDENTS AND THE PUBLIC
THERE ARE REAL AND SOMETIMES VERY PAINFUL CONSEQUENCES OF SPEAKING UP
YOU KNOW WE FELL IN LOVE WITH SCIENCE WHEN WE WERE KIDS AND YET WE SOMEHOW SPEND MOST OF OUR TIME DURING HIGH
AND THE STATE OF MICHIGAN WAS FORCED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE PROBLEM AND TAKE STEPS TO CORRECT IT
LEAD IS A POTENT NEUROTOXIN WHICH CAUSES COGNITIVE AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND IS
NOW AMIDST THIS INJUSTICE FLINT RESIDENTS WERE RALLYING TOGETHER
AMONGST THEM WERE SOME AMAZING WOMEN OF FLINT MOTHERS CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR KIDS WHO CAME TOGETHER
WE ARE NOW REPLICATING THIS IN A 1
ITS CHANGES WILL AFFECT ALL OF HUMANITY
WE OWE IT TO OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN
IT HAS TO BE YOUR OWN GOOD PLAN
WHICH ONE FEELS BETTER
YOU HAVE TO GIVE YOURSELF PERMISSION TO TAKE BETTER CARE OF YOU
AND THIS IS WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO EAT THAT CHOCOLATE CAKE NO DISTRACTIONS
WHETHER YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT 10 POUNDS 20 POUNDS 15 POUNDS IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
JUST DO IT JUST START SOMEWHERE
BUT IT ALL GOES BACK TO YOUR DESIRE
HE LOST OVER 20 POUNDS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY HIS NUMBERS CAME DOWN INTO THE NORMAL
ONE MORE PIECE AND I'M GOING TO BE SICK
AND BY GOOD PLAN I MEAN IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING THAT FEELS GOOD BECAUSE IF IT FEELS GOOD YOU ARE MORE APT TO
INSTEAD OF EXERCISE WHAT IF WE JUST TALK ABOUT MOVING YOUR BODY
AND THEN YOU KNOW LIFE KICKS IN THE BUSYNESS HAPPENS AND I GOT OUT OF THAT HABIT
I LIKE BEING STRONG AND I USED TO DO 25 PUSH UPS MOST MORNINGS
DID YOU WALK AT ALL YESTERDAY
THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH WATER YOU DRANK YESTERDAY AND JUST DRINK A LITTLE BIT MORE TODAY
SO YOU NEED TO GRANT YOURSELF PERMISSION TO EAT THAT CAKE
SO START TODAY SOMEWHERE TAKE ONE PIECE TAKE ONE THING THAT I'VE SAID
THINK BACK TO YESTERDAY AND HOW MUCH YOU MOVED YOUR BODY HOW MUCH WATER YOUR DRANK HOW MANY
WHAT IF WE THINK ABOUT THAT DIFFERENTLY
I KNOW TO ME WHEN I THINK ABOUT LOSING WEIGHT THAT IS SO DAUNTING
SO DOES IT FEEL GOOD TO YOU WHEN YOU SAY I'D LIKE TO LOSE 20 POUNDS OR IF WE LOOK AT IT
AND IT'S TRULY HUMAN NATURE TO WANT WHAT WE CAN'T HAVE
AND AGAIN YOU NEED TO HONOR YOUR BODY
AFTER ALL I COULD CRAFT AN ENTIRE DAY FOR YOU MINUTE BY MINUTE VEGETABLE BY
HIS CHOLESTEROL HIS TRIGLYCERIDES HIS BLOOD PRESSURE
HE WAS READY TO MAKE A CHANGE
AND JUST DO A LITTLE MORE TODAY
HE TOOK HIS OWN GOOD PLAN AND HE MADE IT HIS OWN AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT'S THE REASON WHY HE STUCK TO IT
BECAUSE AGAIN A GOOD PLAN IS SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN DO AND IF A GOOD PLAN IS SOMETHING YOU CAN
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHEN WE ARE HEADED ON A HEALTHY PATH MANY TIMES THE CONCEPT OF CHOCOLATE CAKE
IT WILL BECOME EVIDENT
THEN AT THE OTHER END OF THE JOURNEY IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO TRULY SAVOUR THE ATTAINMENT OF YOUR DEFINED GOALS
WELL I HELPED TO ADMINISTER LARGE SCALED TRIALS COMPARING THE EFFECTIVE TALKING
AND WHY SHOULD IT
THE PROBLEM WELL OUR GOALS AREN'T SPECIFIC IT'S THAT IT'S ALL TOO EASY TO CONVINCE OURSELVES THAT WE'RE GETTING
THAT IN GENERAL YOU ARE EXACTLY THE SAME AS EACH OTHER
EVERY 21 YEAR OLD THAT I MEET NOWADAYS HAS GOT A 1000 FRIENDS AND SOME OF YOU OLD
YOU'RE NOT VERY GOOD
AND NOT EVERYBODY HAS THAT PERMISSION OR THAT PRIVILEGE UNFORTUNATELY
SO AS A RESULT OF THAT DEMOGRAPHERS PREDICT THAT THROUGH 2025
AND I THINK THIS IS BECAUSE THERE IS LESS ROOM LEFT FOR THEIR ENGAGEMENT
HERE IS THE THING
REGULAR BLOOD FLOW IS CALLED LAMINAR WHICH MEANS STREAMLINED NO BUMPS STRAIGHT PATH
THIS IS INCREDIBLY CONSERVATIVE
ANOTHER FUTURISM IS POSSIBLE
WE'RE TOLD THAT NOT ONLY IS CHANGE ACCELERATING BUT THAT THE PACE OF CHANGE IS ACCELERATING
BOTH CAN BE MUCH MORE INTELLIGENT
AND WORSE IS WHEN ECONOMICS IS DEBATED LIKE METAPHYSICS AS IF ANY REAL SYSTEM IS JUST A BAD EXAMPLE OF THE IDEAL
COMMUNISM IN THEORY WAS AN EGALITARIAN UTOPIA
THE FUTURE ON OFFER IS ONE IN WHICH EVERYTHING CAN CHANGE SO LONG AS EVERYTHING STAYS THE SAME
WHAT DOES THE TED AUDIENCE HOPE TO GET FROM THIS
A FLEETING MOMENT OF WONDER
A SENSE THAT MAYBE IT'S ALL GOING TO WORK OUT AFTER ALL
THERE YOU ARE IN MY EAR
YEAH BUT LIKE I DON'T THINK OF MYSELF LIKE PROVIDING DIRECT SEX CARE SERVICES PER
OF COURSE I BELIEVE IN WOMEN'S RIGHTS
BUT GIRLS ESPECIALLY WERE EXPECTED TO BE SEXY WHILE AVOIDING BEING PERCEIVED
NO RIGHT I'M READY
WHAT WAS YOUR NAME
I JUST I DON'T CARE WHAT THESE YOUNG GIRLS SAY
CLASS LET'S BE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN ALL ELECTRONIC DEVICES ARE SWITCHED OFF
AND I CERTAINLY DIDN'T DO MYSELF ANY FAVORS
RIGHT RIGHT SO PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO FEEL MY EXPERIENCE AND MY MEMORY
IT'S PERFECT THAT'S GRAND
WELL IT'S NOT LIKE WHAT YOU HAVE WITH THE INTERNET
OH BECAUSE IT INCLUDES PORNOGRAPHY ALSO
JUST A DROP MORE
IS THAT RIGHT SO PETER
AND ACTUALLY LIKE BROS BEFORE HOS IT DOESN'T MEAN LIKE WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE
WELL FOR ME THOUGH IT WAS AS A GIRL IT STARTED WITH ME DAD
MOST WOMEN IN THE EARLY 2000S CONSIDERED THEMSELVES EMPOWERED AND MEN GENERALLY FELT THEY WERE ALSO
I'M TRYING TO TALK TO BERT RIGHT NOW
THAT'S HOW THEY MARKET ME
I JUST THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO GIVE ME A TEST TO SEE HOW MY MEMORY'S DOING
THIS WAS ALSO KNOWN AS A MOBILE PHONE
YEAH SHE KNOWS I'M HERE
WELL I'VE GOT THIS TERRIBLE DICHOTOMY
SO ANOTHER FACT MOST PEOPLE DID NOT KNOW WAS THE AVERAGE AGE OF AN AT RISK GIRL BEING
REMEMBER THESE EARLY MODULES IN THESE PEOPLE'S FULL IDENTITIES WERE
AND REMEMBER THIS WAS THE VERY FIRST YEAR OF THE BERT PROGRAM
IT WAS QUITE BINARY AT THAT TIME
BUT WHAT WAS THE QUESTION AGAIN
IT'S MY FIRST SINCE BRIDGE AND TUNNEL WHICH I DID ON BROADWAY AND THIS ONE I THANK
SHE SAID MAUREEN FITZROY IS THE LIVING EMBODIMENT OF THE WHORE VIRGIN DICHOTOMY
AND IF THEY FREELY RECALLED SOME OF THE MEMORIES FROM THE FIRST SESSION THEY WERE IN AND IF THIS PERSON TALKED ABOUT
SO I THINK THESE SLIDES I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU ON FICTION WILL ADDRESS THAT
I'M GOING TO SORT OF PUT IT INTO A CONTEXT USING A STORY
WE GET ALL OFFENDED THE RACE CARD
SO SHE WENT
WE GET ALL OFFENDED AND WE TAKE IT PERSONAL THE MINUTE SOMETHING COMES UP
I DIDN'T TALK TO HER BUT SHE ALSO DIDN'T TALK TO ME
AND THE WAY WE TEND TO SOMETIMES WANT TO DEAL WITH THEM IS ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS
I WOULD GET HOME AND JUICE
AND I HAD HAD SOME HEALTH ISSUES
IT WAS ON MY LEGS
AND JUICING WAS REALLY MY KEY
GROWING UP I HAD REALLY BAD ECZEMA ALL OVER MY BODY
AND NOW AT EVERY CORNER YOU SEE A JUICE BAR
JUICING IS A GREAT THING BECAUSE IT'S REALLY CONCENTRATED NUTRITION SO YOU CAN'T NECESSARILY SIT DOWN AND
I COULDN'T BUY IT
SO I WAS EATING A GREAT DIET AND I WAS EATING A LOT OF VARIETY IN MY DIET BUT I KEPT SHOWING UP
SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY JUICE A DAY IN ADVANCE AND IT WILL STILL BE RICH IN ENZYMES VITAMINS AND MINERALS 24 HOURS
SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT THAT WHEN YOU'RE BUYING ORGANIC PRODUCE BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY
THE LITTLE JACK LALANNE JUICER THAT I STARTED ON IS CALLED A CENTRIFUGAL JUICER
SO I MOVED TO SAN DIEGO FOR LAW SCHOOL AND I TOLD MY PARENTS ALL I NEED FOR SCHOOL IS THIS
AND THEY WERE JUST LIKE WHAT
I COULDN'T GO TO A JUICE BAR
AND I THINK THAT IN GENERAL IN OUR SOCIETY NOW EVERYBODY'S STARTING TO SEE THEIR HEALTH DECLINE AND THEY'RE WONDERING
IT'S ABOUT 100 POUNDS
YOU'RE ACTUALLY NOT ABSORBING WHAT YOU READ ON THAT LABEL BECAUSE YOUR BODY EXCRETES THE FIBER
THERE'S TWO TYPES OF JUICING
I COULDN'T FIND IT
THIS YOUNG FITNESS CULTURE EVERYBODY GOING TO YOGA CLASS GRABS A GREEN JUICE
AND I WAS PROBABLY ABOUT 14 AT THE TIME
AND ALL OF THESE THINGS JUST KIND OF BECAME NORMAL TO ME AND I NEVER REALLY THOUGHT WOW THIS COULD BE CONNECTED TO
SO THROUGHOUT MY RESEARCH I BECAME REALLY INTO JUICING
I KEPT READING MORE AND MORE ABOUT THE VALUE OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AND THE WAY THAT THE PHYTONUTRIENTS THE ENZYMES
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WHEN YOU'RE JUICING TO REALLY GO ORGANIC BECAUSE JUICING REALLY MAKES ALL OF THE TOXINS IN THE
SO EVENTUALLY I GOT IT AS A JOINT BIRTHDAY CHRISTMAS PRESENT AND I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS JUST LIKE THE
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT YOUR PARENTS TEACH YOU HOW TO TALK ABOUT
IT'S NOT SHOWN IN MOVIES
THEY'RE A LOT MORE LIKELY TO USE CONDOMS
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT YOUR FRIENDS TEACH YOU HOW TO TALK ABOUT
THEY DIED OF AIDS
AND THAT WOULD MAKE SEX MORE AWESOME FOR EVERYBODY
YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO WAY OF KNOWING HOW TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION UNLESS YOU JUST MAKE YOURSELF DO
AND SO THE WEBSITE FEATURES TIPS AND SCRIPTS ABOUT HOW TO DO THIS AND VIDEOS THAT ACTUALLY MODEL WHAT THAT CONVERSATION LOOKS LIKE
THEY'RE A LOT MORE LIKELY TO TAKE MEDICATION WHICH LOWERS THEIR VIRAL LOAD WHICH MAKES IT LESS LIKELY THAT THEY'LL TRANSMIT THE
STDS CAN CAUSE INFERTILITY AND DO CAUSE INFERTILITY IN THOUSANDS OF WOMEN EVERY YEAR
AND STDS CAUSE WEIRD DISCHARGE AND BUMPS AND HERPES AND WARTS
AND ALL OF THESE THINGS TOTALLY SUCK
I TRULY BELIEVE THAT THE DRIVE I HAVE IN MY TEACHING IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT I WAS DENIED MY OWN PERSONAL
AND ALL AROUND THE WORLD MATH IS A CORE SUBJECT
DRAG QUEENS ARE AMAZING ROLE MODELS FOR HOW TO CREATE CONFIDENCE
WOULD SHE QUIT AND JUST WALK OFF THAT DAMN STAGE
OUR CREATIVITY COMES FROM WITHOUT NOT FROM WITHIN
WE ARE NOT SELF MADE
WE ARE DEPENDENT ON ONE ANOTHER AND ADMITTING THIS TO OURSELVES ISN'T AN EMBRACE OF
MEET YOU AFTER SCHOOL DOWN AT OWL
AND I SAID NO
I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST LIKE A SAYING BUT IT ACTUALLY EXISTS I GUESS
I LIKE THAT RIGHT
AND THEY WOULD GO AND INSTALL THESE
THEY WERE TIRED OF THEM
IT'S LIKE THE EYE OF THE OWL
IT JUST WAS THE GREATEST THING
SO REALLY NICE HAVING YOU HERE
LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH THAT
SO OTHER THINGS RIGHT
AND THEN LOOK AT THIS
I WAS JUST FOCUSED ON A FOOT AHEAD OF ME AS FAR AS I COULD REACH WITH MY OWN HANDS
JUST DO A LOGO MAKE A CONTRIBUTION AND THEN YOU'RE OUT AND YOU FEEL REALLY GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF
THAT'S WHERE THE BOOKS ARE
THAT'S WHERE THE HEART AND SOUL OF THE SCHOOL IS
AND YOU'LL SEE THEM AROUND WHERE YOU LIVE
I THINK WE SHOULD PERHAPS DO A BIT MORE OF IT
THEY GET A BAD RAP
THEY ARE IN FACT THE MOST DIVERSE EVOCATIVE POETIC ASPECT OF NATURE
WAS IT PERHAPS THE COMING OF MODERNITY WITH ITS CELEBRATION OF RESTLESSNESS AND TRAVEL AND
IT BEGINS IN A GARRET IN THE LATE 17TH CENTURY IN THE SWISS UNIVERSITY TOWN OF
WAS IT THE INVENTION OF TELEPHONES OR THE EXPANSION OF THE RAILWAYS
THE LAST PERSON TO DIE FROM NOSTALGIA WAS AN AMERICAN SOLDIER FIGHTING DURING THE FIRST

WELL IN 1688 A YOUNG DOCTOR JOHANNES HOFER HEARD OF THIS CASE AND OTHERS LIKE IT AND CHRISTENED
AND IT'S ONLY WHEN THEY'RE PREPARING TO RETURN THIS YOUNG MAN HOME SO THAT HE CAN DIE THAT THEY REALIZE WHAT'S
SO YOU SEE A BEAR YOUR HEART RATE QUICKENS YOUR PUPILS DILATE YOU FEEL FRIGHTENED YOU RUN VERY VERY
THE PROBLEM WITH THIS PICTURE IS IT DOESN'T ENTIRELY CAPTURE WHAT AN EMOTION
I THINK TO BE TRULY EMOTIONALLY INTELLIGENT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THOSE WORDS HAVE COME
AFTER WATCHING THIS VIDEO AN HOUR LATER RICH PEOPLE BECAME JUST AS GENEROUS OF
YOU'LL TO HAVE TO PARDON THE SOUND QUALITY BECAUSE AGAIN THESE WERE HIDDEN CAMERAS
AND THAT'S A REALLY REALLY INCREDIBLE INSIGHT INTO HOW THE MIND MAKES SENSE OF
NOW IN CALIFORNIA AS YOU ALL KNOW BECAUSE I'M SURE WE ALL DO THIS IT'S THE LAW TO
WE CREATED A STRUCTURE AND STRATEGY BY WHICH WE WOULD SUPPORT THE
THEY WERE SITTING OUTSIDE THEIR HOUSE WAITING FOR THEIR NEPHEW TO COME HOME WHO WAS JUST PLAYING BASKETBALL AT A
I WANTED TO DEMAND TO PRAY TO BESEECH THEM TO STOP THEIR RAIDS AND ASK FOR THEM TO MEET WITH US LOCAL
THE ICE EXECUTIVES WERE SITTING WAY ACROSS THE TABLE FROM US
IN 2009 I STARTED A RESEARCH POSITION WITH NOKIA
AND NOW THEIR STOCKS ARE PROJECTED TO DOUBLE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS
YOU COULD WATCH AMERICAN FILMS WITH JAZZ SOUNDTRACKS IN RUSSIA
THEY MOVED OVER TO THESE GUYS
OTHER PEOPLE IN LENINGRAD STARTED TO DO IT TOO
SO FOR A WHILE IN RUSSIA JAZZ WAS OK
YOUNG PEOPLE LOVED IT OF COURSE
THEY CALLED THEMSELVES THE GOLDEN DOG GANG
FOR A FEW RUBLES PEOPLE COULD COME IN AND USE A MICROPHONE TO MAKE A RECORDING OF THEIR VOICE
BUT HE KNEW IT WAS FORBIDDEN
HOW TO RECORD ONTO X RAYS
HE WAS AN AUDIOPHILE HE WAS A MUSIC LOVER
THEY BECAME SO BUSY THEY GOT A FRIEND INVOLVED
AND OF COURSE THE STATES COMPLETELY CONTROL THE RECORDING INDUSTRY
THERE WAS NO ALTERNATIVE THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY TO GET THIS MUSIC APART FROM IN VERY SMALL QUANTITIES AT
THERE WERE RUSSIAN JAZZ BANDS MANY OF THEM VERY POPULAR
A FEW YEARS AGO I WAS IN RUSSIA WITH MY BAND THE REAL TUESDAY WELD
IN MUSIC THERE WERE LOTS OF EXPERIMENTAL AMAZING THINGS HAPPENING
OF COURSE I'M IN POLAND
UNFORTUNATELY HE WAS CAUGHT AGAIN
WHEN PEOPLE MEDITATE IT ACTIVATES THE FRONT PART OF THEIR BRAIN WHICH IS THE MOST HUMAN
BECAUSE YOU'RE MAKING BETTER DECISIONS
YOU WRITE DOWN THREE THINGS YOU'RE GRATEFUL FOR EVERY DAY
DIET IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL
IT'S NOT PROZAC IT'S GRATITUDE
THAT'S THE COOL THING ABOUT THE BRAIN
I GOT DRUNK WHEN I WAS 16 I HAD A HANGOVER FOR FIVE DAYS
AND AS SLEEP GOES DOWN WEIGHT GOES UP BECAUSE YOUR CRAVINGS GET OUT OF CONTROL
WITHOUT THERE BEING VERY SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES
IT IS DEPENDENT ON THE PHYSICAL HEALTH OF YOUR BRAIN
BECOME VERY SERIOUS ABOUT WHO YOU SPEND YOUR TIME WITH
NEW LEARNING SO TED IS PERFECT FOR THIS
IN MY CLASSROOM I LIKE TO USE A STUDENT TEACHING STUDENT MODEL
GENIUS HOUR IS BASED ON GOOGLE'S 20 POLICY WHERE KIDS WILL ACTUALLY GET 1 HOUR A
BUT GUESS WHAT
PROTEST PROVIDES US ONE WAY TO DO THAT
AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENING NOW
YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T REALLY HAVE ANY VALUE TO A FAMILY WITH MALARIA EXCEPT THAT IT HELPS PREVENT MALARIA
IT TAKES INFRASTRUCTURE
THEY HAVE TO SLEEP UNDER THEM EVERY NIGHT
AND I REALLY HATED THE MOSQUITOS FOR THAT
SO THIS POSES A HUGE ECONOMIC CHALLENGE BECAUSE SAY YOU DO COME UP WITH YOUR GREAT DRUG OR YOUR GREAT VACCINE HOW DO YOU
THE WHOLE CAMPAIGN CRASHED MALARIA RESURGED BACK BUT NOW IT WAS EVEN WORSE THAN BEFORE BECAUSE IT WAS
EVERY PART OF A PERSON BODY MIND AND SPIRIT IS NOURISHED
WHAT THEY WERE DOING CAUGHT PEOPLE'S ATTENTION
IT'S CELEBRATES WORK
IT'S EDUCATION AT ITS BEST
SOMETIMES THEY KILL PEOPLE
SOMETIMES THEY CAUSE CONFLICTS
I'M VERY GRATEFUL BECAUSE I HAD BEEN TAKING GROUPS OF STUDENTS BACK THERE EVER SINCE AND I GET TO GO NEXT WEEK
NOW YOU ACTUALLY KNOW HOW THEY CONNECT TO EACH OTHER BY LOOKING AT THEIR FACEBOOK PAGE
SO YOU MAY WONDER WHY ON EARTH ARE THEY DOING IT
WHY ARE THEY ENGAGING WITH CYBERSPACE
WELL MY THEORY IS THAT IT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE CENSORSHIP ACTUALLY IS LESS EFFECTIVE THAN YOU
I USED MEDICAL COLLEGE GIRLS
BUT I AM ALSO TRYING TO MAKE SANITARY PAD WITH THE GOOD COTTON
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE THIS AS A CORPORATE ENTITY
RURAL EMPLOYMENT THAT I'M GOING TO CREATE
IT'S NOT WORKING
THAT'S WHY I AM ALWAYS JEALOUS WITH THE SAINTS IN INDIA
NOW YOU CLOSE YOUR VAGINA THE GATES ARE CLOSED
BUT I THOUGHT
I WANT TO BE LIKE THAT
WE CAN DO THE WORK BY OURSELVES BUT IT'S MUCH NICER IF YOU ARE WITH US OF COURSE
BUT THE WORDS OF MY GRANDMOTHER KEPT COMING BACK TO ME SHE WAS ALWAYS TO SAY
AND HAVING A PHD IN THE SUBJECT I WAS PASSIONATE ABOUT
OH MY GOD WHERE DO I HAVE TO GO TO BE ABLE TO FLY LIKE A WOMAN AS HIGH AS I WISH
FIRST OF ALL BECAUSE IT PUTS WOMEN AS VICTIM
THIS IS THE WAY BONOBOS DO IT
THEY DIDN'T LIKE THIS AT ALL
SO IT IS CONNECTED
HOW WERE WE TO DO IT
HAS THE WEST STOOD WITH THEM
AND WE MUST BE
I HAVE NO PRETENSIONS TO BE A POET
ANGER AS IRAQI LAWYERS LIKE SAMIRA SALEH AL NAIMI HAVE BEEN TORTURED AND EXECUTED BY ISIS FOR
INSTEAD THEY WATCHED THE UNITED STATES AND BRITAIN SUPPORT THE ARCHAIC GULF MONARCHIES THAT EXPORTED
17 YEARS AFTER HER DAUGHTER'S THROAT WAS CUT IN THE STREET SHE TOLD HER SURVIVING DAUGHTERS THAT SHE WAS
WE ARE HOPE
THINK ABOUT IT
TAP WATER LESS THAN A PENNY
POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY EXPERT DR
I GET THAT FOR NEWBIES THAT MAY BE A LITTLE BIT EXTREME
YOU'RE HAPPY IN THE MOMENT SURE BUT THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE THE THRILL IS IN THE CHASE
ON THE BANK'S TIME
I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE TO BEGIN
LATER THAT NIGHT MY MUM TOLD ME THAT I WAS A REALLY GOOD FRIEND BUT I DON'T THINK I DID ANYTHING SPECIAL BECAUSE
I WILL ALWAYS SHARE SPENDING CAMERON'S LAST DAY WITH HER
HER NAME WAS CAMERON GALLAGHER
SHE DIED THAT DAY
WHEN PROMO STARTED FOR THE 5K MAMMA GRACE STARTED TELLING PEOPLE THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO BE NICE TO
THAT SPEAKS VOLUMES TO MY MESSAGE OF COMPASSION
WE GOT LUNCH AND WENT TO THE PARK
I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW MUCH MY LIFE WAS ABOUT TO CHANGE
FOR SOME IT IS SHARING THEIR STORY
SHE GAVE ME A PIN FOR LISTENING
I WONDER WHERE TAKING RISKS WILL TAKE YOU ALL
AFTER PAYING THEM MY PARENTS NEVER FELT THE SAME ABOUT LIVING IN IRAQ
THEY FORGOT THAT THE ROOTS OF MODERN CIVILIZATION WAS IN MESOPOTAMIA
I REMEMBER PLAYING KICKBALL FOR THE FIRST COUPLE OF TIMES
I BEGAN GETTING USED TO WORKING ALONE
THEY'RE SO HYDROPHOBIC THERE'S NO WAY FOR THEM TO HIDE ALL OF THE HYDROPHOBIC BITS
HOPEFULLY ONE WOULD SOON BE ABLE TO FIND A VARIATION WHICH WAS AGAIN ABLE TO ACT AGAINST THE RESISTANCE BACTERIA
SO WHAT HAVE I BEEN DOING
THAT IS IT'S WHAT THE BACTERIA ARE ABLE TO TURN ON ONCE THE GENE HAS ENTERED THEIR CELL
IT'S MORE THERMODYNAMICALLY FAVORABLE FOR THEM TO AVOID WATER
WE GET RAPED
WE HAVE OUR PLACE
YOU ARE NOT DEAD
BECAUSE WHEN SYSTEMS ARE BROKEN LIKE THE ONES THAT WE'RE SEEING AROUND THE WORLD IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR INVENTION
SOME OF THEM MIGHT BE ONES YOU GAVE
BUT MAYBE ME I GIVE OUT SOMETHING BETTER BECAUSE I GIVE THEM HOPE
AND JUST AS IMPORTANT WE OWE IT TO OURSELVES
IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO TRULY BUILD A WORLD WHERE WE CAN EXTEND SERVICES AND PRODUCTS TO
WE OWE IT TO THE JANES OF THE WORLD
YOU THINK I WILL MISS THE VIOLENCE OR THE DRUGS
WHAT DOES IT MEAN
IT WASN'T ORGANIZED IN THE WAY WE OFTEN THINK OF IT
AND SHE SAID YOU KNOW THE POVERTY WASN'T SO BAD
STROOP TESTS HAVE BEEN DONE WITH METAPHOR AS WELL
PEOPLE HAVE MURDERED THOSE THAT THEY LOVED BELIEVING THAT THEY WERE MURDERING AN IMPOSTER
AND THEY THEN REPORTED THAT HER FATHER WAS COACHING HER
SUFFERERS OF CAPGRAS SYNDROME BELIEVE THAT THE PEOPLE THEY LOVE MOST IN THE WORLD HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY PERFECT DUPLICATES
RATHER IT'S BECAUSE I WANT SOMETHING THAT HAS A SPECIFIC HISTORY
THE FIRST SHOCK IS RECORDED AS VERY PAINFUL
BECAUSE THIS WOMAN COMES UP YOU SEE AT THE END OF THE VIDEO SHE COMES UP
NOW OFTEN A RESULT OF CAPGRAS SYNDROME IS TRAGIC
VAN MEEGEREN WAS CHARGED WITH THE CRIME OF TREASON WHICH IS ITSELF PUNISHABLE BY DEATH
WELL THERE'S AN ANSWER THAT MANY PEOPLE WOULD GIVE
I DON'T DOUBT THAT THAT PLAYS SOME ROLE BUT WHAT I WANT TO CONVINCE YOU OF TODAY IS THAT THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON
WE KNOW THAT THEY HAVE TO LATCH ONTO A SPECIFIC PART SO IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT THE PRECISE STRUCTURE OF THAT PART
SO TO DO THAT WE HAVE TO COMBINE SMART VACCINE DESIGN WITH SMART PRODUCTION METHODS AND OF
SO FOR INSTANCE A BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY HAS NOW FOUND BROADLY NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES TO INFLUENZA
WELL WITH THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES EMERGING NOW I HOPE WE CAN SAY DEFINITIVELY YES
SO HERE'S AN ALARMING THOUGHT
WE'VE GOT THESE NEW ANTIBODIES WE'VE IDENTIFIED AND WE KNOW THAT THEY LATCH ONTO MANY MANY VARIATIONS OF THE
WHY IS THAT
SO THE REAL QUESTION THEN IS HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT YOUR BODY MAKES THE EXACT ONES THAT WE NEED TO PROTECT
SO YOU'VE GOT THIS SITUATION IN 2003 WE HAD AN H5N1
AND I THINK TEDX IS REALLY THE PERFECT PLATFORM FOR US TO CHALLENGE OUR TECH INDUSTRY LEADERS TO SET AN ETHICAL
ADELAIDE INTRODUCED THE ADELAIDE FREE WI FI NETWORK THROUGHOUT THE CBD A FIRST FOR AUSTRALIA
BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS INFANT DEVELOPMENT
WHY NOT TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES
AND I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT'S THE KEY TO ACHIEVING YOUR DREAM
ISN'T IT JUST ANOTHER FORM OF PLAY
THIS LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IS OUR NEW BRAIN DRAIN
THE OIL SLICK WAS NOW MOVING NORTH TOWARDS DASSEN ISLAND AND THE RESCUERS DESPAIRED BECAUSE THEY
JUST LOOK AT THAT 17 YEAR OLD
SO IN THESE SIX YEARS BETWEEN THESE TWO OIL SPILLS THEY'VE BUILT THOUSANDS OF THESE WELL VENTILATED
HUMANS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THE GREATEST THREAT TO PENGUINS BUT WE ARE NOW THEIR ONLY HOPE
I WAS INSTANTLY TRANSPORTED BACK TO THAT MOMENT IN TIME
SO IN WILDLIFE RESCUE AS IN LIFE WE LEARN FROM EACH PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE AND
AND THE TWO MAIN THREATS TO PENGUINS TODAY ARE OVERFISHING AND GLOBAL WARMING
PERSONALLY I LEARNED THAT I AM CAPABLE OF HANDLING SO MUCH MORE THAN I EVER DREAMED POSSIBLE
WELL SHE COULD NOT BE MORE WRONG
SO IF WE EACH DO OUR PART TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND WE CAN HELP KEEP PENGUINS
AND THEY'D BEEN USING IT AT SANCCOB WITH GREAT SUCCESS SO THEY BEGAN USING IT DURING THE TREASURE RESCUE
AND TRULY TO BE A PART OF SOMETHING SO MUCH LARGER THAN YOURSELF IS THE MOST REWARDING
AND AS A RESULT DURING THE TREASURE RESCUE JUST 160 PENGUINS DIED
AND WAS SILVIA GAUS RIGHT
PENGUINS ARE VERY VOCAL BIRDS AND REALLY REALLY NOISY SO I EXPECTED TO WALK INTO THIS
AND WITH THAT CALL MY LIFE WOULD CHANGE FOREVER
WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF OILED PENGUINS AND THOUSANDS OF WILLING BUT
IN FACT MANY PEOPLE COMPARED IT TO A WAR ZONE
SO WHAT HAPPENS
HOW DO YOU DEVELOP THE SKILLS TO DEVELOP THE RESILIENCE TO KEEP GOING WHEN LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES AND
BECAUSE A MARATHON DOESN'T GOOF AROUND
INFORMATION SUCH AS
AND AS I STARTED TO COME OUT TO MORE AND MORE PEOPLE I ENDED UP GETTING INTRODUCED TO OTHER WOMEN WHO WERE LIKE ME
THEY NEVER LOVED ME BECAUSE I WAS STRAIGHT
IT'S TIME TO TAKE IT BACK
THEY WERE UNDER THE RADIATION CLOUD FROM THE CHERNOBYL NUCLEAR DISASTER
AT FIRST THEY WORKED TO SAVE ENERGY
THE SPEED OF ROLLING OUT OF RENEWABLES IS STAGGERING
WE HAD JUST FIVE WEEKS TO RAISE THE 350000 POUNDS THAT WE NEEDED AS WELL AS TO
GERMANY HAS BEEN AN OBVIOUS PIONEER OF THE ENERGY TRANSITION WITH OVER ONE THIRD OF THEIR ELECTRICITY COMING FROM RENEWABLE
THEIR MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH IMPROVES AND EVEN THEIR FAMILIES ARE HAPPIER
SO ESSENTIALLY WE'VE GOT AN ENTIRE POPULATION OF TIRED BUT
I MEAN WHO WOULDN'T ENJOY A LITTLE MORE PLEASANTNESS FROM OUR TEENS AND A LITTLE LESS
WITH A TRULY OUTSTANDING ONE
ONLY ABOUT ONE IN 10 GETS THE EIGHT TO 10 HOURS OF SLEEP PER NIGHT RECOMMENDED BY SLEEP
NOT HORMONES SOCIAL LIVES OR SNAPCHAT
THIS IS DRIVEN IN PART BY A SHIFT IN THE RELEASE OF THE HORMONE MELATONIN
IN MY DEFENSE THOUGH WHEN ANDERSON DISCOVERED POSITRONS HE WAS NOT THINKING ABOUT PET SCANS
I DON'T KNOW
UNSURPRISINGLY THIS HAS MAJOR REPERCUSSIONS FOR HOW GIRLS AND WOMEN VIEW THEMSELVES
AND ALTHOUGH THE ARTICLE GOES ON TO ULTIMATELY DEBUNK THIS IDEA THAT MILLENNIALS ARE WITHOUT HOPE
IT CREATES WHAT IT NAMES
AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR WOMEN IN MINORITIES
EVEN NOW IN THE WEST AFTER THREE WAVES OF FEMINISM AND A POSSIBLE FOURTH BLOSSOMING AT THIS POINT
WHY AT THIS PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME ARE SOME YOUNG WOMEN CHOOSING TO SELF
BECAUSE HERE WE HAVE FOR THE FIRST TIME THANKS TO TECHNOLOGY A WAY FOR THEM TO HOLD ON
IS TAKEN TO REPRESENT EVERYTHING THAT IS WRONG WITH HER GENERATION
PEOPLE WANT TO TALK
TO GIVE THEMSELVES COMMUNITIES AND ROLE MODELS WHERE THERE ARE NONE STRIVING FOR VISIBILITY IN A
EVEN THE CHARGE OF NARCISSISM BECOMES SO MUCH MORE COMPLEX WHEN CONSIDERED IN RELATION TO
DE BEAUVOIR NOTES THAT A WOMAN WHEN ADMIRING OR SHE PUTS IT
CONVENIENTLY ENOUGH THIS BRINGS US BACK TO ONE OF THOSE BUZZWORDS SO BELOVED BY
AND THAT WORD IS NARCISSISM
AND ALL TOO OFTEN WHEN WE DO SEE WOMEN REPRESENTED IN THE CULTURE IT'S THROUGH WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE MALE
SEEMS TO BE THE UNDERTONE TO MANY OF THESE CONVERSATIONS
AS A RESEARCHER WORKING IN THE FIELD OF CULTURAL STUDIES I AM WELL AWARE THAT WHEN IT COMES TO REPRESENTATION IN OUR
FROM SOAP OPERAS TO FASHION CULTURAL PRODUCTS CODED AS FEMININE ARE GENERALLY REGARDED AS
WE USE THEM TO THINK PERCEIVE AND ACT IN A LARGELY HABITUAL AND UNCONSCIOUS WAY BUT WE RARELY REFLECT UPON THEM
WE EVEN SHIFT THEM AWAY FROM PERSONS WHO WE DISLIKE
AND WHILE IT IS TRUE I BELIEVE THAT MOST PERSONS DO NOT HAVE AN ARTICULATE AND ORGANIZED PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE EVERYONE
THEY SEE THE WORLD MORE IN TERMS OF GOOD VERSUS EVIL US VERSUS THEM
WE CHEER FOR OUR FAVORITE TEAM WE APPLAUD WHEN IT SCORES WE SUPPORT OUR TEAMMATES AND WE MAKE
SO THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING A POLITICAL DEBATE OR READING A POLITICAL ARTICLE
IT WAS INTRODUCED BY THE PERSONALITY PSYCHOLOGIST SILVAN TOMKINS
SO WE GROUP TOGETHER INTO RELIGIONS POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES COMMUNITIES MOVEMENTS NATIONS AND SO ON
IF YOU VOTED FOR RIGHT WING PARTY YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO ENDORSE THE NORMATIVISTIC PERSPECTIVE OR A COMBINATION OF BOTH
THEY'RE SO BASIC TO OUR THINKING THAT THEY BECOME INVISIBLE TO US THEY PRESENT THEMSELVES AS THE OBVIOUS TRUTHS
WE HAVE BELIEFS ABOUT WHAT SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE CAN BE TRUSTED
AND WE HAVE BELIEFS ABOUT RELIGIOUS SPIRITUAL AND SUPERNATURAL REALITIES
SO YOU MAY FOR EXAMPLE SEE ANOTHER PERSON IN TERMS OF THE CONSTRUCTS A MAN OR WOMAN
SOME OF THE PLAYERS GET ANGRY VERY EASILY
IT STARTED TO FRUSTRATE THE OTHER PLAYERS
MAYBE A PET DIED
SOMETIMES IT'S JUST A MISCOMMUNICATION BETWEEN TWO KIDS
HOW WAS THIS POSSIBLE
I KNOW IT'S VERY COMPLICATED
THE PRODUCT IS COMPLETELY ADAPTIVE
IN FACT IT BECAME THE OLDEST CONTINUOUSLY OPERATING COMPANY IN THE WORLD
SO WE USE SOME CLEVER IMAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES TO GET A VERY ACCURATE MEASUREMENT OF THE COLOR AT EACH
SO AS SCIENTISTS WE STARTED WONDERING WHAT OTHER TYPES OF PHYSICAL PHENOMENA PRODUCE TINY MOTIONS
IT'S IMPORTANT WHEN YOU TRAVEL TO ANOTHER COUNTRY TO KNOW ABOUT THE CUSTOMS THE CULTURES AND THE PROTOCOLS
SHE LOWERED IT WHEN THE LONDON SUBWAYS WERE BOMBED IN 2005
BUT JUST AS OUR LEADERS ARE GOING TO OTHER COUNTRIES OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE PEOPLE HERE
BECAUSE THE TIMES DEMANDED THAT THAT THEY NEEDED TO CHANGE
WE'RE NOW LIVING IN A MULTICULTURAL SOCIETY THE LIKES OF WHICH THIS NATION HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE
MANY NATIONS HAVE A PROTOCOL FOR EXCHANGING BUSINESS CARDS
I'VE ALSO BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE INVOLVED IN TRADE MISSIONS THAT HAVE TAKEN ME TO COUNTRIES VIRTUALLY ALL OVER THE WORLD
SHE LOWERED IT WHEN 9 11 HAPPENED
SHE LOWERED IT WHEN THE QUEEN MOTHER DIED
AS I'VE SAID KEEP CALM AND CARRY ON
IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS TIME TO TAKE A LOOK AT THEIR PROTOCOLS BECAUSE THE PROTOCOLS THAT HAD BEEN IN PLACE
THAT'S ONLY TRUE MOST OF THE TIME
THEY WANT TO KNOW ABOUT OUR SUCCESS STORIES THEY WANT TO KNOW ABOUT OUR CULTURE THEY WANT TO KNOW ABOUT OUR
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEARLY HALF A CENTURY THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND BEGAN TO FEEL A DISCONNECT WITH
RIGHT NOW TODAY THERE ARE OVER 70 DIFFERENT LANGUAGES SPOKEN IN
IT CAN MAKE EVERYTHING FLOW
WHEN EVERYONE THINKS THAT WHATEVER IS HAPPENING IS JUST HAPPENING NATURALLY
IT WAS IN THE EARLY 1990S
ALL WE HAVE ARE THE QUESTIONS
WHAT VOCABULARY AM I SUPPOSED TO USE
SO HERE'S THE STATE OF THINGS
I'D LIKE TO START BY TELLING YOU A STORY ABOUT ZAYA
LET US MAKE OURSELVES INTO VESSELS UNBREAKABLE SO THAT WE
BANKS JUST WENT TO BEING BANKS AGAIN
HUMAN INGENUITY IS AN UNSTOPPABLE FORCE IN A FREE SOCIETY
THE GOOD BANK WOULD NOT HAVE CLIENTS IT WOULD ONLY HAVE CUSTOMERS
SO I SIMPLY ASK
PEEL BACK THE ONION
IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT ENRICHING A CHOSEN FEW
BECAUSE THE GOOD BANK BELIEVES IN HAVING SMART CUSTOMERS
WE DON'T WANT A SYSTEM THAT IS TOO BIG TO FAIL WE WANT A SYSTEM THAT IS TOO GOOD TO FAIL
THOSE CUSTOMERS WOULD BE THOSE WORST AFFECTED BY THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS
THE GOOD BANK WOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT INSIDIOUS DISEASE THAT TERMINAL ILLNESS INFLICTED ON YOUNG PEOPLE CALLED A LIFETIME OF
WE NEED A ROBUST PROFITABLE AND HEALTHY BANKING SECTOR IN OUR SOCIETY
IN MY REHABILITATION I MADE A VOW
HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT HIGHER TAXES AND LOWER REAL WAGES
THAT PRICE WOULD BE PAID FOR MANY DECADES TO COME
SO POOR COUNTRIES ARE BY AND LARGE LOW TRUST COUNTRIES
AND HE SAID HEY I WAS IN THE MEN'S ROOM
BUT IN FACT ECONOMISTS WERE FLUMMOXED ON WHY THE SECOND PERSON WOULD EVER RETURN ANY MONEY
HERE'S MY PHONE NUMBER
LOVE SAYS EIGHT HUGS A DAY
BUT HE WAS RIGHT IT WAS A STUPID IDEA
YEAH I'VE BEEN WORRYING ABOUT THAT TOO
WE NEED TO KNOW WHY PEOPLE ARE DOING WHAT THEY'RE DOING
WE HAVE TO FIND THE OWNER FOR THIS
YES MY MOM WAS HAPPY ABOUT THAT LAST ONE
WE SHOWED THAT OXYTOCIN INFUSION INCREASES GENEROSITY IN UNILATERAL MONETARY
OH YOU'RE SAVING MY LIFE
GET YOURSELF A FAT REWARD
NOW WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENS
WELL THIS IS VERY VALUABLE
I DIDN'T KNOW FOR SURE OXYTOCIN CAUSED TRUSTWORTHINESS
I SAW THAT PEOPLE WHO WERE RELIGIOUS AND NON RELIGIOUS WERE EQUALLY OBSESSED WITH MORALITY
SO THE WAY MANY CONS WORK IS NOT THAT THE CONMAN GETS THE VICTIM TO TRUST HIM IT'S THAT HE
FIRST OF ALL OXYTOCIN IS A SHY MOLECULE
IT'S EMPATHY THAT MAKES US HELP OTHER PEOPLE
BUT IN HUMANS IT WAS ONLY KNOWN TO FACILITATE BIRTH AND BREASTFEEDING IN WOMEN AND IS RELEASED BY BOTH SEXES DURING
THERE MUST BE A REASON WHY
I'M IN HIGH SCHOOL
AND THESE ARE OUR GIRLS
THIS CRIME KNOWS NO SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS
IT AFFECTS ALL OF US
SHE APPEARS TO HAVE SOME FRIENDS
PRINCESSES IN FAIRY TALES HAD PARENTS WHO LOVED AND ADORED THEM
WE ARE SO BEHIND
AND A FRAME IS JUST A WINDOW
I GOT YOU IN A FRAME
IT'S SO EXPENSIVE TO HAVE THESE PEOPLE WORKING THERE
BECAUSE THE WELFARE STATE AND THE UNIONS WORK IN TANDEM WITH CAPITALIST DYNAMICS
WE NATURALLY HAVE THAT
WALT DISNEY WAS FIRED FROM HIS FIRST JOB AT A NEWSPAPER BECAUSE HE LACKED IMAGINATION
TURN OFF THE INTERNET
FOR SOME CONTEXT WE PASSED THE ORBIT OF THE MOON IN LESS THAN NINE HOURS
5 YEARS TO GET THERE
AT THE END OF THE DAY WE'RE HAPPY WE NEVER LISTEN TO ANYONE WHO SAID THAT BATIK AND TECHNOLOGY SHOULD
WE WERE TELLING HIM THAT WE'RE ABLE TO CREATE BATIK PATTERNS USING
NOTHING THAT WE'VE EVER DONE OR CONCEIVED OF IN THE PAST HAS BEEN ABLE TO RECONCILE THESE TWO CONFLICTING
THE SECOND MONTH YOU DO THE SAME THING
WITH THE JOINT EFFORTS THIS PROJECT MAY HELP TO SOLVE THE PRESSING CLEAN WATER ISSUES IN CHINA WHILE
IT IS A JOURNEY OF HOW US AND CHINA WILL CONTINUE TO EXPLORE SHARED OPPORTUNITIES AND
WHEN CHINA WAS TRYING TO INNOVATE ITS MADE IN CHINA' PRODUCTS THERE WAS CONCERN IN AMERICA WHETHER THERE IS A RISING
IT IS A JOURNEY OF HOW CHINA WOULD ADVANCE THROUGH INTEGRATION THROUGH THE WORLD COMMUNITY
THE MOST RECENT CHINA LED AIIB BANK WHICH IN US IS ABSENT AND THE US LED TPP WHICH IN
I WAS IMAGINING THAT I CAN SIT IN A CLASS AT HARVARD YARD I CAN CLIMB ON TOP OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING I CAN
WHILE I WAS ENJOYING MY CLASSES AT HARVARD YARD I WAS ALSO AMAZED BY THE HOT DEBATE ABOUT HOW CHINA WILL
WHILE I WAS CLIMBING THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING I WAS ALSO AMAZED THAT THE SKYSCRAPERS NEARBY ARE
THESE MICROSTUDIOS ARE REALLY KEY IN THIS OVERALL ECOSYSTEM BECAUSE THEY TAKE SMALL ORDERS
SO THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE IS LIKE YOU'RE EXPLORING IN AN AMUSEMENT PARK
THE NEXT MORNING THE DELIVERY UNCLE WILL GIVE IT TO ME WHEN I WAKE UP
THAT IS EXACTLY WHY I'M HERE TO TELL EVERYONE THAT WE NEED TO WATCH IT STUDY IT AND PLAY A PART
FIVE YEARS AGO IN A FASHION STUDY WE FOUND THAT ON AVERAGE A CHINESE CONSUMER WOULD BE BUYING FIVE TO
A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO I WAS SHOPPING WITH A FRIEND IN TOKYO
SO I'VE SEEN SOME EARLY SIGNS THAT THE ECOSYSTEMS ARE SHIFTING THEIR FOCUS TO PAY ATTENTION TO SOLVE
WHERE DOES THE STICKINESS COME FROM
THAT'S THREE TIMES HIGHER THAN THE UNITED STATES
BUT THERE ARE REALLY NO SIMPLE ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS
IN THIS INTEGRATED ECOSYSTEM SOCIAL MEDIA CAN REALLY REDEFINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
IS THREE TO FOUR TIMES HIGHER THAN THE TRADITIONAL GROCERY STORE AND HALF OF THE REVENUE
ON AVERAGE A CONSUMER WOULD SPEND ONE HOUR ON THEIR MOBILE PHONE SHOPPING
THEY WERE JUST BROWSING ON THEIR MOBILE SITE AND THEN BUYING WHATEVER THEY SAW
A HUGE SHOPPING REVOLUTION IS HAPPENING IN CHINA RIGHT NOW
SHOPPING BEHAVIORS AND ALSO TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS HAVE EVOLVED DIFFERENTLY THAN ELSEWHERE IN
EVERY MONTH 500 MILLION CONSUMERS ARE BUYING ON
HOW SHOULD I LIVE
WHAT DID YOU DO WHEN YOU WERE A CHILD
AND WE CAN STEER OUR PERSONAL LIVES TO ITS GOAL THAT WE WANT AND THAT IS IN HARMONY WITH WHO WE
LET US ALL WORK OUR OWN PATH TOWARDS HOW WE WANT THE WORLD TO BE
AT THAT MOMENT I MADE A DECISION
IF YOU'RE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH CLOSING YOUR EYES THAT'S FINE
RELAX YOUR FACE
AND THAT SEPARATION HAS BROUGHT FEELINGS AND THOUGHTS OF UNWORTHINESS
WHO AM I TO CHANGE THE WORLD
I WANT TO SHARE SOMETHING THAT I'VE DISCOVERED
NOW HOW CAN THIS BE
AS I GOT CLOSER I WAS COMFORTED BY HER WARM SMILE
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU NOTICED THIS OR NOT
GOING BACK TO THAT STORMTROOPER IF I DID GET THAT CHEST PLATE OFF IN TIME WHAT WOULD YOU
I'LL LEAVE YOU WITH ONE POINT
THEY KNOW WE EXIST THEY KNOW THERE'S AN OUTSIDE WORLD
IF YOU HAVE AN INFECTION GO TO A DOCTOR
WESTERN MEDICINE CAN'T TOUCH THOSE
USING AUTOMATIC WEAPONS TO SLAUGHTER UNCONTACTED PEOPLES IS THE
BUT ROUGHLY A THOUSAND TIMES AS MANY PEOPLE WHO
BUT THE10 YOU KNOW THE 10 PEOPLE ARE FREAKED OUT
THE SECOND IS
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT MAKING SIMULATOR REALITIES BY HUMANS
SO CAN WE TAKE A REAL BRAIN AND MAKE IT INTO A VIRTUAL MIND
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR DEVELOPING IMAGINATION AND HAVING AN IMAGINATIVE MIND IS
TODAY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT ONE OF THE BIGGEST MODERN DAY CHOOSING PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE WHICH IS THE CHOICE OVERLOAD
WHO ARE THEY ACTUALLY SUPPOSED TO BE INFORMING
IT'S AN ARABIC MEDIUM SCHOOL
DO WE REALLY WANT TO END UP WITH 600 LANGUAGES AND THE MAIN ONE BEING ENGLISH OR CHINESE
WE NEED MORE THAN THAT
AND NEITHER DOES GERMAN
SO I KEPT DOING THIS
WELL IT TURNS OUT THEY DO LIKE SNOW
SCIENCE IS ORGANIZED SKEPTICISM
THERE'S JUST A FEW ANIMALS THERE
WE DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THE CLIMATE SYSTEM WORKS
THERE'S THE EUROPEAN JACKAL
THAT'S HALFWAY THROUGH ITS GESTATION PERIOD
ARE THERE SMALL SCALE EXPERIMENTS OR SYSTEMS WE CAN NUDGE AND PLAY WITH
AND THE OPTIMIST IN ME IS TRYING HARD TO LEAN TOWARDS THIS IS AWESOME AND REALLY EXCITING
HOW ON EARTH DO WE THINK ABOUT IT
YOU WROTE WE ARE AS GODS AND MIGHT AS WELL GET USED TO IT
SO THIS WHAT ELSE IS GOING
IT'S LIKE MEDICINE
AND YOU'VE PROBABLY FINISHED THE BOOK
AND ASIAN ELEPHANTS THEY DON'T LIKE SNOW RIGHT
CA WE'LL COME BACK TO THE MAMMOTHS BUT EXPLAIN HOW WE SHOULD THINK OF EXTINCTIONS
THERE'S BEARS COMING BACK
THERE'S LYNX COMING BACK
THERE WERE SO MANY STORIES I WENT TO DIFFERENT UNIVERSITIES AND DID LECTURES ABOUT COMMUNITIES AND I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO GO TO WILLIAMSPORT
MARSHALL WAS DYING AT THE TIME SO I TOOK THAT PAINTING INTO HIS DEATHBED AND HIS DAUGHTER WAS READING HIM THE LETTERS WHILE I WAS
IT WAS THE DAY BEFORE WE WERE LEAVING MOLDOVA AND SHE GOT A HOLD OF ME
I WENT BACK TO MR
SHE SAID WHY DON'T YOU AND YURI COME WITH US
WE GOT ON THE PLANE WE YOU KNOW WE WERE DIVERTED BECAUSE THERE WAS FOG OVER MOLDOVA TO ROMANIA
THEY ALSO LIKED THE IDEA SO YURI AND I WENT TO DIFFERENT BUSINESS OWNERS AND DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY AND EVERYBODY THAT WE WENT
THEY WERE FROM MOLDOVA AND I WAS LIKE OH MY GOD WHERE AM I GOING
MY WHOLE LIFE I'VE BEEN PAINTING MURALS
SO I STARTED TO THINK HOW WONDERFUL IT WOULD BE TO TAKE THE MURAL IN STATE COLLEGE STITCH IT ON THE INTERNET TO THE MURAL IN
I GROUND THE METAL OFF THE BACK OF THE CROSSES AND WHEN WE PUT THE CROSSES UP WE PUT RELIGIOUS SYMBOLS
80 FIREFIGHTERS BUFF THOSE CROSSES FOR AN HOUR A DAY FOR 80 DAYS STRAIGHT
ANN OLIVET WAS GETTING READY TO GO TO NORWAY TO MEET WITH HER NEPHEW WHO IS A FAMOUS COMEDIAN JAN BACH ASSUMED SPELLING
SO WE TOOK THE MONEY THAT WE RAISED ON THAT PROJECT AND WE BOUGHT PLANE TICKETS
MY FRIENDS WOULD SAY YOU KNOW THE GUY FROM GHOSTBUSTERS THE EVIL GUY HE WAS FROM MOLDOVA
AFTER SHE SPOKE OUT A WOMAN WHO WAS 70 YEARS OLD CAME UP TO MY DAUGHTER AND SAID I WAS RAPED LIKE YOU WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE AND I
LISTENING TO YOU I AM NOW GOING TO GET HELP
AND I FOUND OUT THAT THEIR STORIES WERE LIKE OURS AND THEY WERE LIKE OH WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A MURAL LIKE THIS IN OUR COUNTRY
SCHREYER A YEAR LATER AND I SAID MR
SCHREYER YOU'RE GOING TO HATE THAT YOU TAUGHT ME THAT ONE THING
THEY WERE SENDING ME ARTICLES AND LETTERS
SO I GOT ON FACEBOOK AND I FACEBOOKED OVER 300 STELLA ROTARUS
I THOUGHT ABOUT THE BROADWAY SHOWS I WENT TO AT THE EISENHOWER
IT THOUGHT ABOUT ALL MY ARTIST FRIENDS
SHE TALKED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO HER
WE FLEW TO NORWAY AND WE MET WITH HIM AND WE ALSO WERE AMAZED BY HOW PEOPLE JUST
IT HAS A SYMMETRY SUCH THAT YOU CAN'T INJECTION MOLD IT
THEY CAN'T ETCH WAFERS THAT WELL
SO WE'RE JUST AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS DISCOVERY
WELL IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU THINK OF AS OUR BODIES
ON THE OTHER HAND WHEN WE DO TOURS OF OUR LAB AT THE BIOFRONTIERS INSTITUTE AND WE EXPLAIN THAT WE
SO YOU PROBABLY HEARD THAT WE'RE PRETTY MUCH ALL THE SAME IN TERMS OF OUR HUMAN DNA
AND SO HOW MUCH DO THEY OUTNUMBER US
SO I DEFINE CHUTZPAH VERY DIFFERENTLY
AND THE CRITICS HATED IT BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT WAS A JOKE HE WAS PLAYING ON THEM
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN TRUE UP UNTIL NOW BUT DID MOSES COME DOWN FROM MT
WILL YOU MAKE A WIND TURBINE LOOK PRETTY
UNPRINCIPLED PEOPLE ALREADY HAVE PLENTY OF CHUTZPAH DON'T WORRY ABOUT THEM
THAT'S A FACT
WHAT ABSOLUTE RUBBISH
AND TURBINES ARE UGLY
WE'RE NEVER GOING TO ESCAPE
I'M HERE TO SELL YOU CHUTZPAH YOUR OWN CHUTZPAH
I DON'T EVEN CARE IF IT DOESN'T PRODUCE ELECTRICITY
BECAUSE YOU NEED TO
AND IT TAKES CHUTZPAH TO STOP BELIEVING THEM AND MAKE A BREAKTHROUGH
THAT'S A FACT
LET'S GET PRACTICAL
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TURBINES
SO WE STARTED TO CHALLENGE THESE FACTS
I THINK IT'S UNFAIR
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID
WHO HAD SOMETHING NEGATIVE ON THE SIGN
HE DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE HER MATCHES
NO NOT TRUE
TWO SEPARATE FACTS
THEY WERE LONELY AND OVERWHELMED BY WORK
MAYBE THIS IS BECAUSE THE TANGO EMBRACE IS AN EXPRESSION OF THE ARGENTINE CULTURE HISTORY AND
AS SIMPLE AND AS INNOCENT AS THAT
JUST TO PLAY THE GUITAR
I HAVE A ROOM AT MY PLACE A ROOM AT MY PARENTS' PLACE
SO TALKING ABOUT JAZZ DEMOCRACY
AND THEN YOU SEE THE OTHER GUY
THAT WAS THE BEST AUDIENCE I EVER HAD
SO EVEN WE JAZZ PLAYERS ALTHOUGH I STATED ALL THE GOOD STUFF AND THE GOOD WAY OF
WE HAVE A GOOD TIME
JAZZ IS LIKE A LANGUAGE
WE ARE TAKING CHANCES WHEN WE PLAY
WOMEN ARE NOW ALLOWED TO PRAY IN OUR CHURCH WIDE MEETINGS AND THEY NEVER WERE BEFORE IN THE GENERAL CONFERENCES
WE'RE ALL JUST PART OF RELIGIONS
I'M THE FIRST WOMAN IN BOTH SIDES OF MY FAMILY TO EVER WORK OUTSIDE THE HOME AND EVER
WHEN I HEAR THESE ARGUMENTS I STILL CONTINUE TO BRISTLE BECAUSE I HAVE FAMILY AND FRIENDS
AND TO MY PARENTS ME DOING SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS HAVING A SLEEVELESS TOP RIGHT NOW SHOWING MY SHOULDERS
THIS WAS THE THOUGHT UNDERLYING THE DEBT PROJECT' STARTED BY NETWORK AFTER IMPRISONMENT IN
THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS FOR THAT
THEY ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND
WHY CAN'T OFFENDERS SOLVE THEIR ECONOMIC PROBLEMS THEMSELVES
PLAY IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THIS DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE AS STUDENTS ARE LEARNING SO MUCH ABOUT THE
EIGHTY PERCENT OF STUDENTS ARE READING AT OR ABOVE GRADE LEVEL BUT
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU USED THE WORD AWESOME TODAY
IMAGINE IF YOU WILL HAVING TO SCHLEP EVERYTHING ON YOUR BACK
YES PHOTOGRAPHY IS AWESOME
AND YET I PROMISE YOU HE LEARNT THE MOST VALUABLE LESSON THAT DAY
BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT I WAS VERY LUCKY GROWING UP IN ARGENTINA BECAUSE I GOT TO EXPERIENCE THINGS THAT MOST PEOPLE
THAT'S PROBABLY SOME OF US IN THIS ROOM
LET'S START FINDING FUN AND ENGAGING WAYS TO ALLOW OUR CHILDREN TO EXPERIENCE
BECAUSE THAT'S THE FIRST LESSON
SO ONCE WE'VE FIGURED OUT HOW TO EARN MONEY MANY OF US STRUGGLE HOW TO KEEP IT AND MY EXPERIENCE
THAT EXPERIENCE HAS STUCK WITH ME FOREVER
BUT HOW MANY OF US GOT ANY FINANCIAL EDUCATION AT SCHOOL
AND IT'S A HARD BALANCE AND IT'S A HARD CALL TO MAKE
IT SAID YOU HAVE TO AMEND THE AMERICAN THE AUSTRALIAN EVERY OTHER GOOGLE SO IT CAN'T BE GOT AROUND
THEY DON'T WANT TO DO THIS THEY'RE BURDENED WITH IT
AND FREE WILL THAT GREAT GIFT THAT ESSENTIAL CONDITION OF OUR HUMANITY
WE'RE NOT HANDLING OUT OUR EMAIL PASSWORDS FOR A REASON
AND WHEN EMBARRASSING THINGS HAPPEN WE CAN CHOOSE TO FORGET
BUT HERE YOU HAVE THAT GOVERNMENTAL BURDEN AND ITS SHIFTED ONTO A CORPORATION
SO THE CORE OBJECTION TO THE RIGHT TO BE FORGOTTEN IS THAT NO MATTER
AND TYPE IN THE SAME SEARCH TERMS AND YOU'LL GET DIFFERENT RESULTS WHICH TAKE YOU TO EXACTLY WHERE YOU WANT TO
BUT TO THEM I SAY THIS YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS UNNATURAL
BUT THESE VALUES ONLY MEAN SOMETHING BECAUSE OF THE METAPHYSICAL PROPOSITION THAT WE HAVE FREE WILL
BUT IT'S REALLY NOT BECAUSE WHAT THEY ARE SAYING IS THAT EU LAW SHOULD APPLY EVERYWHERE
UK WHICH IS THE BRITISH GOOGLE
YOU JUST TYPE IN GOOGLE
AND THIS IS A REALLY POIGNANT EXAMPLE OF PROBABLY THE STRONGEST CASE FOR THE RIGHT TO BE FORGOTTEN OR MAYBE IT IS ONE OF THOSE
BUT I'M CONFIDENT THAT NATURE WILL FIND A WAY
MAYBE MR GONZALEZ DESERVES A FRESH START
BUT I QUESTION THAT THAT'S QUESTIONABLE
NOW IMAGINE THAT THAT HORRIBLE MOMENT IS RECORDED OR RECOUNTED AND PLACED ON THE INTERNET
SO IN THE CONTEXT OF US TRYING TO DEAL WITH THAT TRAGEDY PEOPLE WERE LOOKING AT THE BOWLER SEAN ABBOTT AND
DENTED CAN UNDENTED OPEN CAN NOW SEALED
YOU JUST SAID THAT
FIRST OFF BEFORE I ANSWER THAT CAN WE JUST ACKNOWLEDGE HOW HARD IT IS TO BE A MAGICIAN IN 2013
IMAGINE THE EMPTINESS THE VOID THE VACUUM
ARMANDO IS GOING TO PERFORM A TRICK
AUDIENCE GIVE ME A NO WAY
VANISHING COKE TRICK
WHY AM I A MAGICIAN
IT'S JUST BECAUSE OF THE WAY IN WHICH OFFSHORE WORKS MOSSACK FONSECA HAS FEWER
WE GET AN INSIGHT INTO HOW CLIENTS AND BANKS AND LAWYERS GO TO
AND TODAY OUR MISSION IS FRESH FOR ALL
ANYONE WHO'S EVER OPENED A FRIDGE TO FIND MOLDY STRAWBERRIES OR A BAG OF SOGGY SPINACH KNOWS HOW FRUSTRATING AND
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING
BECAUSE THEY USED AGAIN THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX
VERY BAD FOR HIM
A LOT OF PEOPLE NEVER TALK IN PUBLIC BUT THEY KNOW FOR SURE THAT THEY AREN'T GOOD AT IT
YOU NEED TO BE SURE
SHE DOESN'T LIKE ME
HOW DO WE REALLY MAKE DECISIONS
WHAT IS THE PROBLEM
AND IT'S NOT TRUE
YOU FEEL BAD BUT SOMETHING WORSE HAPPENS
YOU CAN ASK YOURSELF HOW DO I KNOW THAT THINGS ARE GOING TO BE WRONG
THAT MOMENT WHAT IT CHANGED IS THAT I COULD BE WRONG
WELL BECAUSE WE ARE AFRAID OF FAILING
I WAS JUST A STUDENT
THEY ARE THE NEURONS IN CHARGE OF PREDICTING THE FUTURE
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
IS THIS REAL
THE SECOND TIP IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT
TO BE SURE ABOUT THINGS
BUT HOW DOES THIS WORK
SO WHAT CAN WE DO
BUT SOMETHING MAGICAL HAPPENS IN THAT MOMENT
THE FUTURE CAN CHANGE IN ANY MOMENT
HOW IS YOUR EXAM
WE THINK THAT OUR PAST EXPERIENCES TELL A LOT ABOUT THE FUTURE
HOW TO CREATE A FLYING MACHINE
HOW CAN I BE SO SURE ABOUT SOMETHING
DO A REALITY CHECK
IT'S WHERE LOGIC IS WHERE LANGUAGE IS WHERE THE REASON WHAT MAKES
IN THAT MOMENT HE HAD TO USE THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX AND THINK
I NEED TO BE SURE ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS
THE FIRST ONE WAS
AND THEN YOU FEEL BAD FRUSTRATED
YOU WILL SAY BUT THEY ARE NOT REAL
THAT'S THE FIRST THING
LET'S BEGIN WITH THE BAD NEWS
SOMETHING THAT I'LL TELL LATER
SO WELL I KEPT RUNNING
HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED WHY PEOPLE SAY WE ARE THE CHOICES OF OUR LIVES
YOU CAN CHOOSE WHAT TO DECIDE
WHY ISN'T IT THAT EASY
BUT COME ON I KNOW THAT YOU TRIED HARD YOU STUDIED A LOT
AND THAT MOMENT IN MY LIFE DIDN'T CHANGE THAT
YOU ARE NOT CREATING DOPAMINE YOU ARE NOT CREATING SEROTONINE
WHAT IS CALLED
AND THEN WE CREATE IN OUR BRAIN A LOT OF DOPAMINE SO WE FEEL GOOD WE
INSTEAD OF VIEWING CLOUDS AS AN OBSTRUCTION TO A CLEAR SKY I ENCOURAGE US ALL TO ACKNOWLEDGE
MY PATH WAS CLEARLY MARKED I HAD TO PERFECT ENRICH AND EXPRESS MYSELF IN A WORK OF ART THAT WOULD
WHEN I CAME ACROSS THIS QUOTE BY SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR MEMORIES CAME FLOODING BACK TO ME
THEY MOVE THEIR CROPS FROM ONE AREA TO ANOTHER TO ALLOW THE SOIL TO REPLENISH AND THEY CAREFULLY CONTROL THEIR HUNTING
THEY FACE CATASTROPHE IF THEIR LAND IS NOT PROTECTED
I'VE SEEN RANCHERS CALL UNCONTACTED INDIANS DIRTY AND LAZY
WE ARE NOT WATCHING THE WORLD FROM OUTSIDE
ENTERING UNCONTACTED TRIBES' LAND AND FORCING CONTACT IS FATAL
WITHIN A FEW DECADES THEY WILL BE EXTINCT
IT'S A RIGHT ENSHRINED IN NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONS
IT'S NOT FAR THEY TOLD ME
WHEN I VISITED THAT VILLAGE A FEW MONTHS LATER I WAS SHOCKED AND SADDENED TO FIND THE
JUST BEFORE MIDDAY DRENCHED FROM THE HEAVY RAIN WE ARRIVED AT A BEAUTIFUL PATCH OF FOREST THE FAMILY
AND WE MUST MAKE CONTACT WITH THEM TO BRING THEM INTO THE SO CALLED MODERN WORLD
DURING THE GOLD RUSH THE RUBBER BOOM THE DECADES OF FORCED CONTACT EXPEDITIONS UP UNTIL THE LATE 1980S YET
I TOOK THIS PHOTO TO SHOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND TO GENERATE PRESSURE IN THEIR FAVOR
AMAZINGLY AFTER THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE PUSHED THE BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE URGENT HEALTH CARE THE
THAT THEY'RE BACKWARD AND PRIMITIVE RELICS OF A REMOTE PAST
IT'S A RIGHT ENSHRINED BY THE UNITED NATIONS
BECAUSE OUR CONSUMPTION OF WOODEN FURNITURE OF PETROL FOR CARS OF GOLD JEWELLERY IS
UNCONTACTED TRIBES ARE WELL AWARE OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD
AND IN CASE THAT'S NOT ENOUGH WHAT ABOUT THE HEALTH OF OUR PLANET
THEY FOUND THEMSELVES FORCED TO ABANDON THEIR NOMADIC LIVES FORCED TO MAKE CONTACT WITH THEIR AW NEIGHBORS
WE ARE NOT SEPARATE FROM IT
THEIR LAND IS BEING INVADED BY LOGGERS MINERS RANCHERS OIL AND GAS PROSPECTORS
AND I'VE WORKED WITH INDIGENOUS LEADERS WHO RECEIVE DEATH THREATS SIMPLY FOR SPEAKING OUT FOR THEIR UNCONTACTED RELATIVES' RIGHT TO
AND SOON AFTER THEY RETURNED TO THEIR UNCONTACTED LIVES IN THEIR FOREST COVERING THEIR TRACKS AS THEY WENT SO THAT NO ONE
THEY TAKE ONLY WHAT THEY NEED FROM THEIR FOREST
THEY KNOW THEIR ENVIRONMENTS INTIMATELY
AW INDIANS IN THE BRAZILIAN AMAZON FOR EXAMPLE HAVE SHOWN ME HOW THEIR UNCONTACTED RELATIVES USE THE RESIN OF THE MA
WELL WE NEED TO ACT FAST
UNCONTACTED KAWAHIVA INDIANS BUILD INTRICATE LADDERS UP TREES TO COLLECT HONEY FROM BEES' NESTS AND THEY MAKE TRAPS
OR WOULD YOU RUN AND HIDE FLEEING TO PROTECT YOUR FAMILIES AND FIGHT FOR YOUR FUTURE
THIS IS THE MOMENT OF FIRST
WE PUT A CERTAIN VISION OF WHAT GOOD OR BAD OR NORMAL OR USUAL IS IN FRONT OF PEOPLE BY
MY MOTHER WELL MOM
LESS IS MORE
AND IT'S A PSYCHOLOGICAL SIGNAL
SHE HAD FOUND THE ABILITY TO MANAGE HER CRAZY
HAVE I GOT A CRAZY GOING ON RIGHT NOW
AND WHEN WE CREATE ONE CHANGE IT'S GOING TO BECOME CONTAGIOUS
THINK ABOUT IT
I'M MARRIED TO THE RCMP
AND WE RESPECT THAT BECAUSE WE EMBRACE THAT
I CAN'T LIVE LIKE THIS ANYMORE
AND WHEN WE CREATE THESE SMALL CHANGES WHAT WE DO IS WE MOMENTARILY INTERRUPT
BECAUSE WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS WE WANT TO CREATE THAT CHANGE
EMBRACE YOUR CRAZY
IT MIGHT WORK
SO IT'S BASED ON THE PREMISE OF THINGS LIKE
IT'S NOT DEEP
IT MIGHT BE READING AN ARTICLE THAT'S RELEVANT THAT HAS A SUGGESTION IN IT FOR YOU
MAYBE TRY BUYING A CROSSWORD PUZZLE BOOK
OR THINK OF THOSE TIMES DURING LIFE CHANGES WHEN YOU MAY BE IN MENOPAUSE OR MIDLIFE OR GOING THROUGH SEPARATION
I DON'T LIKE YOU SAYING THE WORD CRAZY' IN THIS CONTEXT
CRAZY' IS A WORD THAT HAS AN OLD MEANING
IT HAS A BAD REPUTATION
AND EVERYBODY IS WITH YOU ON IT
THAT ALL CHANGED WITH ONE INCIDENT
TO WATCH YOUR HUSBAND WASTE YOUR FAMILY'S MONEY AND TO SEE YOUR KIDS GO TO BED HUNGRY
WE LEARNED THROUGH OUR RESEARCH THAT THE FINANCIAL LIVES OF THE POOR ARE INCREDIBLY COMPLEX
TO O IS ALSO A GREAT EXAMPLE OF HOW THE POOR CAN BE INCREDIBLY INNOVATIVE AT DESIGNING
SHE EXPLAINED TO US THAT HER HUSBAND WAS ALCOHOLIC ABUSIVE AND ADULTEROUS
SO WE ASKED WHAT WOULD THAT BE LIKE
BUT IN 96 I MADE MY LAST PIECE
AT RISD YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DRAW FROM AN IMAGE
I MADE A COMPUTER OUT OF PEOPLE
NOW WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
IT'S A POWERFUL THING
DEATH IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE OFTEN DISCOURAGED TO TALK ABOUT OR EVEN THINK ABOUT BUT I'VE REALIZED THAT
SHAME IS ONE OF THE SELF CONSCIOUS FEELINGS THAT THE VERY BEST PEOPLE THAT
AND THEY BOTH ARE BLIND
SO THEY ARE VERY BRAVE
THE GREAT THING ABOUT MELATONIN IS IT HAS GREAT ANTIOXIDANT QUALITIES THAT RID OUR BRAIN
AND SO THAT DID SOMETHING FIRST THAT WAS A LITTLE COUNTERINTUITIVE
THEY HAVE AN INDUSTRY BODY WHICH IS THE WAY MOST INDUSTRIES WORK
SO THIS LEFT RIGHT MOTION WAS SORT OF A WHIPLASH TYPE PHENOMENON
HIS HEAD DID NOT MOVE TO THE RIGHT
THERE IS HOPE
THEY'RE NOT REGULATED BY THE GOVERNMENT ANYWAY
THAT'S A REALITY
AND SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS FOR SOME OF YOU OF MORE IMMEDIATE NATURE I'VE GOT A COUPLE YEARS
SO WHAT MIGHT BE HAPPENING THERE
AND SO WE ARE COLLABORATING WITH A COMPANY IN SWEDEN CALLED H VDING
SO IT RIGIDLY COUPLES TO YOUR SKULL AND GIVES YOU THE MOST PRECISE POSSIBLE MEASUREMENT OF HOW THE SKULL MOVES
PEOPLE HAVE TRIED OTHER APPROACHES WITH HELMETS
MOST EXPERTS THINK THAT THAT'S THE CRITICAL FACTOR THAT MIGHT START TO TELL US WHAT IS HAPPENING IN CONCUSSION
GO TO PLACES HUMAN BEINGS HAVE NOT BEEN TO
WE NEED TO PUT AN END TO THIS GAME OF BLAME THAT HAS PREVENTED US FROM TAKING FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR OWN
WE HAVE TO MUSTER THE WILL AND COURAGE TO DO WHAT PEOPLE HAVE NEVER DONE
ENVISAGE WHAT PEOPLE HAVE NEVER IMAGINED
IN FACT SIX OF THE 10 COUNTRIES WHERE 95 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION SAID
IN SOME CASES RELIGION DRIVES MANY AFRICANS TO EXTRAORDINARY LENGTH TO ATTACK OTHER HUMAN
SO WE LIKE THAT
OK HE NEEDS TO BE CHALLENGED AND HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THAT
THE LABEL IS BASICALLY I SLIP INTO ACCEPTING LABELS WHEN I BECOME
SO IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO BE AWARE OF THAT AND TO LIMIT
USE IT ON A DAILY BASIS AND YOU WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE AND THE WORLD AROUND YOU IN MANY WONDERFUL WAYS
DRUNKEN MONKEY WANTS YOU TO TAKE SHORTCUTS
HE WAS TELLING ME TO LIVE IN MY STRENGTH WHETHER I CALL THAT GOD SPIRIT COURAGE
AND REFLECTING BACK ON THAT SITUATION I ALSO REALIZED THAT WHEN HE WAS DELIVERING THE FAITH
AND HE SHARED SOMETHING WITH ME THAT WAS VERY INSIGHTFUL
ONE IS ANOTHER AMERICAN INVENTOR TED HENTER
WEBSITES ARE OFTEN VERY VISUAL AND THERE ARE ALL THESE SORTS OF GRAPHS THAT ARE NOT LABELLED AND BUTTONS THAT ARE NOT LABELLED
I SLOWED IT DOWN FOR YOU
IT IS SOMETHING THAT A GROUP OF COUNTRIES AND THE WORLD BLIND UNION ARE ADVOCATING
AND HIS MACHINE WHICH WAS AS BIG AS WASHING MACHINE WAS LAUNCHED ON THE 13TH OF JANUARY
I DID NOT HAVE TO BE NICE TO PEOPLE
WELL BECAUSE WE CANNOT TRANSPORT BOOKS ACROSS BORDERS THERE HAD TO BE SEPARATE VERSIONS READ IN ALL THE
MANY WEBSITES WE CANNOT READ USING JAWS AND THE OTHER TECHNOLOGIES
NOW THERE ARE STILL BARRIERS IN FRONT OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES
AND THAT IS WHY NEXT MONTH IN MOROCCO A MEETING IS TAKING PLACE BETWEEN ALL THE COUNTRIES
SO THAT IF BOOKS ARE AVAILABLE UNDER A COPYRIGHT EXCEPTION AND THE OTHER COUNTRY HAS A COPYRIGHT EXCEPTION WE CAN TRANSPORT
I WONDER WHAT THE FUTURE WILL HOLD
THERE ARE OTHER BARRIERS BROUGHT ABOUT BY OUR LAWS
I AM GOING TO ASK THAT WE PLAY IT AT THE SPEED I READ IT
CAN YOU PLAY IT THAT ONE
WHETHER IT BE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SIDNEY LAW SCHOOL WHERE I SERVED A TERM AS DEAN OR NOW AS I
FOR THE FIRST TIME I COULD READ WHAT I WANTED TO READ BY PUTTING A BOOK ON THE SCANNER
COMPUTERS HAVE CHANGED THE LIVES OF US ALL IN THIS ROOM AND AROUND THE WORLD BUT I THINK THEY HAVE CHANGED THE LIVES OF WE
I LOVE STORIES I WANT TO READ
IT HAD A SPEECH SYNTHESISER
I WANT THAT TO HAPPEN
THEY'RE ONLY IN PLACE TO LIMIT THE FUTURE CREATION OF DEBRIS
SATELLITES EVEN PLAY A ROLE IN THE OPERATION OF OUR FINANCIAL AND ENERGY MARKETS
BUT WE SIMPLY CANNOT REACH NEW HEIGHTS AND CREATE AN EVEN HIGHER GARBAGE DUMP
OR WHAT IF THAT VERY SAME ROBOTIC ARM COULD REFUEL THE PROPELLANT TANK ON A SPACECRAFT THAT RELIES ON CHEMICAL
SO FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THOSE LOW EARTH ORBITING SPACECRAFT TO BE MADE TO DEORBIT IN
NOW MOUNT EVEREST IS ACTUALLY AN INTERESTING COMPARISON OF A NEW APPROACH TO HOW WE INTERACT WITH OUR ENVIRONMENTS
SO MAYBE YOU GET INTO THINGS LIKE HIGH POWERED LASERS OR TUGGING USING NETS OR TETHERS AS CRAZY AS THOSE
PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD RELY ON SATELLITE INFRASTRUCTURE EVERY DAY FOR INFORMATION ENTERTAINMENT
AND THEN ONE REALLY COOL POSSIBILITY IS THE IDEA OF ORBITAL TOW TRUCKS OR SPACE MECHANICS
THERE'S ALSO COMPLEX SPACE LAWS AND POLITICS THAT WE HAVE TO SORT OUT
WAS DESIGNED FOR END OF LIFE DISPOSAL VIA A SMALL DRAG SAIL
AND WHILE WE OFTEN TAKE FOR GRANTED THE SERVICES THAT SATELLITES PROVIDE US THE SATELLITES THEMSELVES
OR MAYBE A SATELLITE NEEDS TO HAVE TECHNOLOGY ON BOARD TO HELP ACCELERATE DEORBIT
THESE GUIDELINES ARE ALSO NOT LONG TERM THEY'RE NOT PROACTIVE NOR DO THEY ADDRESS THE DEBRIS THAT'S
SO NOW YOU HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO ABANDON YOUR CAR WHERE IT IS ON THE HIGHWAY
ONE OF THE MOST COMMON PLACES WE SEND SATELLITES IS THE LOW EARTH ORBIT POSSIBLY TO IMAGE THE SURFACE OF EARTH
SATELLITES THERE REMAIN IN THE SAME PLACE ABOVE EARTH AS THE EARTH ROTATES WHICH ENABLES THINGS LIKE
SOLDIER LAUGHING AT PEOPLE DYING
THAT'S A PROBLEM
SOLDIERS ARE INHUMAN PEOPLE
THAT GIVES THE IMPRESSION HAS GIVEN THE IMPRESSION TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD THAT U
THAT MADE YOU VERY HIGH PROFILE IN ICELAND
I MEAN WE HAVE A HARM IMMUNIZATION POLICY
HOW DARE YOU
ICELAND'S A NORDIC COUNTRY SO LIKE NORWAY IT'S ABLE TO TAP INTO THE SYSTEM
WHICH WAY IS IT GOING TO GO
YOU KNOW I WAS A VERY YOUNG JOURNALIST ACTIVIST AT AN EARLY AGE
MY SON ISN'T
IT SHOWS A U
EMBASSY DIPLOMATIC CABLES
AND THAT AFTER A COUPLE OF DAYS MADE THE KENYAN PRESS FEEL SAFE TO TALK ABOUT IT
INTELLIGENCE ANALYST BRADLEY MANNING ARRESTED AND IT'S ALLEGED THAT HE CONFESSED IN A CHAT ROOM TO
INSTEAD THEY PUBLICIZED YOUR SIDE
THINK HOW OFTEN YOU HEAR PEOPLE SAY TO YOU MACHINES CAN ONLY PERFORM TASKS THAT ARE PREDICTABLE OR REPETITIVE RULES
THE LUMP OF WORK WASN'T FIXED
THOSE ECONOMIC PIES HAVE EXPLODED IN SIZE
TO SEE THIS GO BACK TO THE CASE OF MAKING A MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS
NEW TASKS HAVE TO BE DONE
THIS IS THE PATH WE'RE CURRENTLY ON
THERE'S COUNTLESS SYSTEMS OUT THERE THAT CAN DIAGNOSE MEDICAL PROBLEMS
SO WHAT DO THESE THREE MYTHS TELL US THEN
AND THESE THINGS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO ARTICULATE AND SO IT WAS THOUGHT THESE TASKS WOULD BE VERY HARD TO AUTOMATE
AND TODAY YOU HEAR PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE LUMP OF LABOR FALLACY TO THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE OF ALL TYPES OF WORK
A PICTURE THAT WE SEE ON OUR TELEVISION SCREENS IN BOOKS IN FILMS IN EVERYDAY COMMENTARY IS ONE WHERE AN ARMY
IT DIDN'T MATTER THAT THAT HUMAN BEING THAT DOCTOR COULDN'T EXPLAIN HOW SHE'D PERFORMED THE TASK
THERE'S NO FIXED LUMP OF WORK OUT THERE TO BE DIVIDED UP BETWEEN PEOPLE AND MACHINES
HUMAN BEINGS ONLY STAND TO BENEFIT IF THEY RETAIN THE UPPER HAND IN ALL THESE COMPLEMENTED TASKS BUT
AS OTHER ECONOMISTS HAVE NOTED SOLVING THIS PROBLEM WON'T BE EASY
THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF DISCUSSION FOR INSTANCE ABOUT VARIOUS FORMS OF UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME AS ONE
AS THIS WORKER USED THE MACHINE AND BECAME MORE PRODUCTIVE THE PRICE OF WASHERS WOULD FALL DEMAND FOR WASHERS WOULD RISE
EARLIER IN THE YEAR A TEAM OF RESEARCHERS AT STANFORD ANNOUNCED THEY'D DEVELOPED A SYSTEM WHICH CAN TELL YOU WHETHER OR NOT A
HOW DOES IT WORK
TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS RATHER THAN COMPLEMENT HUMAN BEINGS COMPLEMENTS MACHINES INSTEAD
ALMOST EVERYONE LIVED ON OR AROUND THE POVERTY LINE
THEY'VE FALLEN FOR THE INTELLIGENCE MYTH THE BELIEF THAT MACHINES HAVE TO COPY THE WAY THAT HUMAN
ECONOMISTS CALL THESE EFFECTS COMPLEMENTARITIES BUT REALLY THAT'S JUST A FANCY WORD TO CAPTURE THE
RESOLVING THIS TERMINATOR MYTH SHOWS US THAT THERE ARE TWO FORCES AT PLAY ONE MACHINE
IF ECONOMIC GROWTH CONTINUES AT TWO PERCENT OUR CHILDREN WILL BE TWICE AS RICH AS US
I MET AMANDA LEPORE I WENT TO THE BOX I SAW CLUBBING AND SAW THESE GENDERFUCKED CLUB KIDS AND MY EYES
AND I REALIZED IT'S ALL ABOUT HETERONORMATIVE SPACE
THERE I WAS A 19 YEAR OLD ON THE SEARCH FOR A LIVE AFFIRMING QUEER THEORY THAT BROUGHT GAY AND
IT DOESN'T MEAN THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THEM
AND A LOT OF WELL MEANING PEOPLE WANT YOU TO GET THERE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
BECAUSE LATER IT WOULD BE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT WHEN YOU'VE MADE THOSE COMMITMENTS
IT'S A GOOD THING
NOW IT'S 27 FOR WOMEN AND 29 FOR MEN AND IT IS STILL RISING
AND SO HAVING THIS LIFE STAGE OF EMERGING ADULTHOOD ALLOWS BOTH YOUNG MEN AND YOUNG WOMEN TO
BUT THAT IS NOT A BAD THING
ADULTHOOD WILL STILL BE READY WHEN YOU ARE
THAT WILL NARROW THE RANGE OF YOUR CHOICES
I THINK FEW OF US WOULD VIEW THAT AS A NEGATIVE DEVELOPMENT
BUT IT'S NOT THEIR LIFE
IT TAKES LONGER TO PREPARE YOURSELF FOR THE KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY THAN IT DID FOR A MANUFACTURING
AND EVENTUALLY PEOPLE WILL DEPEND ON YOU
AND THEIR PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS CAN'T HELP BUT LOOK AT THE PROGRESS OR LACK OF IT OF THEIR
OUR MANUFACTURING OUTPUT IS ACTUALLY SIX TIMES GREATER NOW THAN IT WAS IN THE 1950S
THE 60S AND THE 70S CHANGED THAT WITH THE YOUTH MOVEMENT
THOSE ARE TRUTHS UNDERLYING THEM
BUT THAT'S GOING ON AND IT'S STILL USED EVERYDAY JUST LIKE IT HAD BEEN 200 YEARS AGO
WHEN YOU HAVE A BREAST CANCER PATIENT YOU NEED TO KNOW WHETHER THE CANCER IS SPREADING
THERE ARE INSTITUTIONS SAN DIEGO STATE MAJOR COMPANIES
SO WHAT IS A BURN
THAT IS A HUMONGOUS STRESS TO A PATIENT THAT'S ALREADY HAD CANCER
THIS GUY'S FACE IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE THAT FOREVER
THEREFORE IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHAT EXACTLY IS GOING THROUGH THEIR BLOOD
5 CENTIMETER WOUND
I HAVE A FINAL ASSERTION WHICH IS THAT WE'VE ONLY JUST BEGUN
THEREFORE I CAN MAKE YOUR TUMOR LIGHT UP
SO WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THESE APPLICATIONS ALREADY AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO KEEP ON MOVING FORWARD
IF I HAVE THAT STAMP I KNOW EXACTLY HOW DEEP THIS BURN GOES
THESE ASSERTIONS AREN'T FACT
I SHOULD DESCRIBE WHAT THAT IS
BUT YOU GET THE IDEA OF WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET ACROSS
THE SIGNAL FOR A VISIBLE RED LIGHT GOES BARELY A MILLIMETER BELOW YOUR SKIN
WE GET A SCAR ON OUR HAND YOU KNOW I GOT A BAD PAPER CUT AND I GOT A TINY LITTLE SCAR
SO I'M GOING TO GO TO ASSERTION NUMBER 3
THIS ONE IS GROUNDED ON BASIC FACT
THIS TYPE OF COMPROMISE OF SKIN DURING THE BREAST RECONSTRUCTION CAN OCCUR IN UP TO 40 OF PATIENTS
IN FACT THE FDA ISN'T EVEN REALLY WORRIED ABOUT THE MANAGEMENT OF THE INITIAL BURN INJURY
SO WHAT I'LL PRESENT HERE ARE A FEW ASSERTIONS AND THEN I'LL GO AT THE END AND ASK YOU A QUESTION
I LIKE BLUE EYES I WANT BLUE EYES FOR MY KIDS
THE FIRST ONE I'VE ALREADY SAID
I'M HERE SOLELY AS SOMEONE WHO HAS DONE SOME WORK FOR A FEW YEARS IN A PRETTY EXCITING AREA AND I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT A
FROM THAT DIAGNOSTIC GOLDEN AGE WE WILL THEN ENTER A MANAGEMENT GOLDEN AGE
DRIVING BACK HOME AND THEY'D NEED TO GET CALLED BACK IN BECAUSE HOURS AFTER THEIR SURGERY SOMETHING LOOKED LIKE IT WAS GOING
THEREFORE IF A MODEL WITH A PIG WORKS THEN IT IS MORE LIKELY TO WORK ON A HUMAN THAN IF WE WERE TO USE ANOTHER ANIMAL
IT'S A PRETTY BOLD STATEMENT TO MAKE
AND BURNS DON'T ALL COME IN THE SAME SHAPE AND SIZE
YOU HAVE A GREAT TIME AT THE BEACH YOU GET A LITTLE BIT OF A SUNBURN YOU TURN RED YOU CAN'T SLEEP ON YOUR RIGHT SHOULDER AT NIGHT IT RUINS YOUR
YOU SEE RED THEREFORE CUT YOU SEE BLUE THEREFORE DON'T
FEW PEOPLE WHO WILL SAY THINGS THAT ARE ALL ENCOMPASSING LIKE THIS ARE REALLY TRYING TO TELL YOU FACT THOSE WHO SAY THEY ARE ARE WRONG
FINALLY IT'S THE PURE BULK OF HAVING THIS APPARATUS IN YOUR BURN UNIT THAT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT
YOU'LL AGREE YOU'LL DISAGREE
YOU HAVE TO KEEP A BURNED PATIENT'S HAND COMPLETELY STATIONARY UNDER THE MACHINE TO GET A GOOD READING
THERE IS A BIT OF DYING SKIN WE HAVE TO CUT AGAIN
IT'S A PRETTY CRUDE MANAGEMENT BUT WE'VE GOTTEN REALLY GOOD AT IT
PATIENTS WITH NOT AS BAD WOUNDS DON'T USUALLY COST THIS MUCH
THERE ARE HUGE GRANTS GOING AROUND PURELY TO TRY TO GET THE MONEY FROM THIS PRIZE
BECAUSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT THIS DYE GOING THROUGH YOUR BODY WE'VE JUST TALKED ABOUT BURNS WELL WHAT ELSE CAN WE USE WITH THIS
THAT MEANS I CAN WAVE AT YOU AND YOU'LL GET A READING FROM IT
THIS IS BOTH EXCITING AND SCARY TO A LOT OF PEOPLE BECAUSE IF WE CAN PERSONALIZE YOUR DIAGNOSIS PERSONALIZE YOUR MANAGEMENT MEDICINE
NOW I CAN PERSONALIZE MY KIDS
I'M TALKING ABOUT THIS PRETTY ABSTRACTLY LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT BURNS ARE
BUT ALSO BECAUSE WE ARE NOT WORRIED ABOUT MANAGEMENT OF THE INITIAL BURN INJURY
OK THAT'S OKAY
WHAT ELSE MAKES THIS SO COOL
THERE'S AN EXPENSE FACTOR THERE'S AN OPERATION FACTOR THERE'S A PURELY EXPERIENCE BASED TACTIC NOT MUCH DIFFERENT THAN ULTRASOUND
IF I'M ABLE TO DRIVE DOWN THE STREET IT DOESN'T MAKE A WEIRD NOISE IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG THEN AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED MY
THIS APPLIES MOSTLY TO PATIENTS THAT WE'VE LOOKED AT WITH BREAST CANCER WHO NEED BREAST RECONSTRUCTIONS
IN REALITY THAT'S WHAT MAKES GREAT RESEARCH AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES GREAT MEDICINE
THE PROBLEM IS PARTIAL THICKNESS THIS SECOND DEGREE BURN CAN PROGRESS TO A THIRD DEGREE BURN IF YOU DON'T
THE ANSWER IS
THAT MAKES WHATEVER READINGS YOU GET FROM THIS MACHINE NOT QUANTITATIVE AND BY THAT I MEAN THAT YOUR TEMPERATURE IS
I DON'T RECOMMEND YOU DO THAT IF WE ACTUALLY TAKE A SCAN IT'S NOT GREAT
PATIENTS WHO WILL DIE BECAUSE OF THEIR BURN INJURIES COST HUNDREDS UPON HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO MANAGE
I WILL MAKE ANOTHER ASSERTION
BUT INSTEAD THEY'LL MAKE YOU THINK
ONE MUST HAPPEN BEFORE THE OTHER
THAT'S SIMPLY NOT GOOD ENOUGH WHEN TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT IMPACTS A PATIENT'S LIFE SO MUCH
I CAN SHOW YOU TWO BURNED PATIENTS WITH THE EXACT SAME BURNED AREA AND THEIR MODE OF MANAGEMENT IS PHENOMENALLY DIFFERENT
SO THAT'S WHAT WE DID
WHICH ONE OF YOU IS IN A ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP
EVENTUALLY SHE OPENED UP SHE TOLD US ABOUT HER ADDICTED SON
SIX MONTHS LATER SHE DROPS OUT AGAIN
THIS TIME THIS REST TAKES UP TO FOUR MONTHS
LET ME ASK YOU SOME PERSONAL QUESTIONS
SO OF COURSE PEOPLE LIKE TO GO TO LOCAL SHOPS BUT YOU'D BE PREPARED TO GO A LITTLE BIT FURTHER IF IT WAS A
I'D ALREADY WRITTEN A VERY SUCCESSFUL BOOK IN THE UK IN WHICH I WON A 100 BET
YOU'VE MADE IT COMPULSORY FOR US TO HAVE A BIRTH CERTIFICATE
WE DO SOMETHING SMARTER THAN JUST TAXING THE HELL OUT OF THESE PEOPLE
SO I HAD A LOOK
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY'RE LINING THEIR POCKETS
BUT IS THIS NAVE
JUST THINK OF ALL THE DODGY DEALINGS THAT GO ON AROUND THE WORLD BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO GET
YOUNG PEOPLE COULD GET JOBS GOING OUT TO WORK FOR THESE CHARITIES AND DOING THINGS IN SOCIETY THAT HELPED
BECAUSE THAT'S BEEN TRIED
I KNOW THAT MILLIONAIRE HOUSEHOLDS IN THE USA THERE'S 5
WE HAVE SOME MONEY
I CAME HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 1998 TO WIN A CRAZY BET
I UNDOUBTEDLY I FEEL HAPPIER
AND WHEN YOU DO YOU CHANGE THEIR LIFE
PROBABLY A BAD IDEA FOR YOUR LIFE
WHEN I MET HIM AT THE AGE OF 15 HE HAD JUST BEEN KICKED OUT OF HIS THIRD
THAT WAS NOT A SURPRISE
TODAY WE HAVE SCANNED OVER 500 CONVICTED FELONS INCLUDING 90 MURDERERS
THAT WAS NOT A SURPRISE
WHAT IF WE EVALUATED AND TREATED TROUBLED BRAINS RATHER THAN SIMPLY WAREHOUSING THEM IN
OVER THE NEXT 22 YEARS MY COLLEAGUES AND I WOULD BUILD THE WORLD'S LARGEST
SPECT BASICALLY TELLS US THREE THINGS ABOUT THE BRAIN
IMAGING WAS SHOWING US THERE WAS A BETTER WAY
WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT THIS IS THE TOOLS TO DO THIS ARE FREE
ANOTHER REASON HAS TO DO WITH A COPING PROCESS THAT PSYCHOLOGISTS CALL PSYCHIC NUMBING
THIS IS WHAT A SLAUGHTERHOUSE WORKER SAYS I DON'T THINK OF FARMED ANIMALS AS
THERE ARE SO MANY REASONS
BUT DON'T JUST TAKE MY WORD FOR IT
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO SHOW YOU ANY GRAPHIC IMAGES OR
I DON'T WANT TO CHANGE THE WORLD
WE NEED THINGS TO BE BETTER
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
IT'S A LEVEL PAYING FIELD
PASS ON THE BRACELET
THEY NEVER TALK ABOUT MONEY
I DIDN'T ASK YOU FOR ANYTHING MUCH
I'M JUST ASKING FOR A TINY BIT
I'M NOT TRYING TO SELL YOU INSURANCE
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE TIME OF THE YEAR WHEN EVERYONE ELSE CARES
I DON'T HAVE AN ULTERIOR MOTIVE
NO ONE IS FEELING LIKE A CHARITY CASE
AND IT WON'T BE IN A HISTORY BOOK IT WILL BE AN IPAD 17 OR SOME TYPE OF A HOLOGRAPHIC PAGE THAT YOUR KID'S KIDS WILL TALK ABOUT
THAT'S THAT INTIMATE MOMENT BETWEEN TWO STRANGERS
WE NEED PHYSICAL ACTION
I WANT SIMPLE LITTLE TINY THINGS
7 MILLION OF THESE HAVE MADE THEIR WAY TO A 123 COUNTRIES WITH NO MARKETING NO ADVERTISING
THEY ALWAYS TALK ABOUT A DAY WHEN SOMEONE MADE THEIR DAY BETTER
I'M A MAMA'S BOY
I DON'T LIKE CHANGE
IF I WERE TO ASK ANYONE IN THIS ROOM WHEN YOU GOT THAT CAR THAT RAISE WHEN YOU BOUGHT THAT HOUSE WHEN YOU GOT THAT NEW
THAT'S THE REASON 1
THEY TOOK ME TO BUY MY PROM DRESS
AND SHE SAID WELL SHE LIVES IN LOUISIANA
I'M LIKE I'M FROM GEORGIA I GET THAT
AND THE EVENING AFTER HER FUNERAL I WAS SITTING AND READING HER OBITUARY OVER AND OVER
I WANTED THE SAME OPPORTUNITY AS MY TWO OLDER BROTHERS WHO LEFT BEFORE ME TO COME TO THE UNITED
IT IS TIME TO SAY NO MORE
DON'T TELL ME IT WAS THE NORM
SHE WAS SO HAPPY
SEE I WAS DESPERATE TO LEAVE IRAN
THEN YOU ARE GIVEN A PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION BY YOUR DOCTOR WHICH YOU HAVE TO PURCHASE YOURSELF AND THEN YOU HAVE TO SELF ADMINISTER THE DRUG
ALL AVAILABLE MEASURES
IT'S PROBABLY A BIT OF A CRAP TELLY AND A BIT RUBBISH AS A DVD PLAYER
THEY DECIDED THIS WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH AND THEY WANTED TO GET IT UP TO 99
IT'S NOT AN UNREASONABLE THING TO DO IT'S AN ECONOMICALLY EFFICIENT THING TO DO
AYELET FISHBACH HAS WRITTEN A PAPER ABOUT THIS
SO WE WALK OUT OF THE SHOPS WITH ONE OF EACH
THE ONLY THING THEY DIDN'T EXPECT IS THEY'RE UNITING EUROPE THROUGH A SHARED MILD HATRED OF THE FRENCH AND GERMANS
IN CHINA NOT REALLY UNDERSTANDING THE PRINCIPLE BEHIND THIS THEY APPLIED THE SAME PRINCIPLE TO GREEN TRAFFIC LIGHTS
IF AT THE SAME TIME YOU'D GONE AND ASKED PEOPLE WHAT PERCENTAGE OF FIRST CLASS MAIL ARRIVES THE NEXT DAY
AND SO THEY'RE PREDOMINANTLY INTERESTED IN PSYCHOLOGY
I THINK THE DANGER WE HAVE IN TODAY'S WORLD IS WE HAVE THE STUDY OF ECONOMICS CONSIDERS ITSELF TO BE A PRIOR
EVERYBODY ELSE AT THE TIME OF GOOGLE MORE OR LESS WAS TRYING TO BE A PORTAL
WHAT WE HAVE IS EXACTLY THE SAME THING THE SAME ACTIVITY BUT ONE OF THEM MAKES YOU FEEL GREAT AND THE
WHAT THEY DON'T SAY IS WELL THE NUMBERS ALL SEEM TO ADD UP BUT BEFORE I PRESENT THIS IDEA I'LL SHOW IT TO SOME REALLY CRAZY PEOPLE TO
IT'S AN INNATE THING CALLED GOAL DILUTION
MICROFINANCE IS AN INCREDIBLY POWERFUL TOOL THAT LEADS TO SELF SUFFICIENCY AND SELF RESPECT BUT WE MUST
AND NOT ONE COUNTRY IN ALL THE WORLD HAS ELIMINATED ITS ECONOMIC PARTICIPATION GAP
AND SHE HAD COME TO WASHINGTON NOT SEEKING A HANDOUT AND NOT SEEKING A MICROLOAN
SO MAYBE YOU COULD INTERVIEW HER
SHE SELLS CHOCOLATES
AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WOMEN THEY ARE EITHER EXCEPTIONS TO BE DISMISSED OR ABERRATIONS TO
AND THAT'S JUST TO START
ORG THE MICROLENDER IS ACTUALLY NOW EXPERIMENTING WITH CROWDSOURCING SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED
SO WHY WOULDN'T WE CELEBRATE AND ELEVATE THESE CHANGE MAKERS AND JOB CREATORS
WE HAVE SO MUCH ROOM TO GROW
SHE HAD COME SEEKING SERIOUS INVESTMENT DOLLARS SO THAT SHE COULD BUILD THE FACTORY AND BUY THE EQUIPMENT SHE
WE DON'T NEED TO INVENT SOLUTIONS BECAUSE WE HAVE THEM CASH FLOW LOANS BASED IN INCOME RATHER THAN
THE BIASES WHETHER INTENTIONAL OR OTHERWISE ARE PERVASIVE AND SO ARE THE MISLEADING MENTAL
BUT THEY HAD HUSTLED TO FEED THEIR KIDS AND PAY THEIR RENT
WHY ARE YOU SO PASSIONATE
AND THAT'S REALLY HOW I BECAME AN ENTREPRENEUR
I'M QUITE HAPPY TO DO THAT
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY A FEELING
SUCH A NICE CHILD TO HAVE AROUND
SO WHEN WE'RE TREATING ADDICTION SURE WE GOT TO GET PEOPLE SOBER FROM WHATEVER THEIR ADDICTIVE PATTERN IS
I'LL LAY THE TABLE
SURRENDER TO HELP
AND THE PARENTS HEAR
I'VE SET YOU UP FOR THIS AND I ACTUALLY NEED TO START GETTING A HANDLE ON HOW I BEHAVE AS A RESULT OF HOW
THE PARENT GENERALLY SPEAKING WILL DO ONE OF TWO THINGS
YES WE WORK WITH PEOPLE WHO MIGHT WANT TO TAKE MEDICATION ALONGSIDE BUT I'M REALLY INTERESTED
SO I USED TO SPEND MY LIFE PLAYING PERFORMING PEOPLE PLEASING BEING DEFIANT BEING THE REBEL BEING ANYONE
AND WHEN YOU LOOK IN THE MIRROR TO REALLY APPRECIATE THAT AND TO MAKE THE BEST FRIEND YOU CAN OF YOURSELF BECAUSE IF
IF YOU'RE BUSY DOING THE WASHING UP AND YOU'RE KIND OF STRESSED AND THEY COME IN AND START GOING MA'AM
TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT HER FAMILY BACKGROUND THAT WOULD INDICATE WHY SHE MIGHT FEEL COMFORTABLE AROUND TROUBLED PEOPLE
LET'S WORRY ABOUT YOU
AND I THOUGHT SURRENDER TO HELP
AND THEN I GO TO SCHOOL AND I DO TIDY UP TIME AND WHEN A NEW GIRL COMES IN I SHOW HER AROUND
I EITHER GET DO YOU KNOW WHAT
AND THAT'S NORMAL
SO WHEN MUM NEEDS HELP I'LL SAY
THIS IS THE AA 12 STEP FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM WHICH FUNDAMENTALLY IS ABOUT SURRENDER
BY THEIR ATTRACTION TO WIND FARMS
AND THE REALITY IS THAT BATS CAN BRING US SO MUCH BENEFIT IF WE JUST LOOK IN THE RIGHT
SO SAY FOR EXAMPLE THE REGION OF THE GENOME THAT I WAS LOOKING AT WAS A REGION THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR VISION
SO INDEED WE NEED THEM FOR OUR ECOSYSTEMS TO FUNCTION PROPERLY
EVOLUTION ACTS AS A SIEVE
AND HOPEFULLY IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS I'LL BE GIVING YOU A TEDTALK ON THAT
BUT BATS ARE VERY DIFFERENT
IF WE LOOK AT THAT REGION IN MAMMALS THAT DON'T SEE SO WELL SUCH AS BATS AND WE FIND THAT
THINK OF A MOUSE
IT'S WORKING ITS WAY SLOWLY ACROSS THE U
AND SO WITH FLIGHT IT'S VERY METABOLICALLY COSTLY
WE'RE A LITTLE FRIGHTENED BY THINGS THAT CAN PERCEIVE THE WORLD SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY THAN US
NOW AS I SAID BEFORE BATS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR OUR ECOSYSTEMS TO FUNCTION CORRECTLY
BECAUSE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE FOR BUILDING SPACE SYSTEMS IS ENTIRELY EARTH BOUND
I THINK WE NEED TO CREATE BACKUPS OF HUMANKIND ELSEWHERE IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM
WE HAVE 31 BRIGADES IN THE U
IT'S ABOUT QUESTIONING EXISTING WAYS OF DOING THINGS
THEY'RE CREATING A WHOLE NEW SET OF WAYS FOR CITIZENS TO BE INVOLVED BESIDES VOTING OR SIGNING A
AND IN MANY WAYS HACKING IS WHAT BUILT AMERICA
SO KEEP THAT IN MIND
IT'S ABOUT CRITICAL THINKING
YES YOU CAN GET YOUR GENOME SEQUENCED IN TWO WEEKS
YES IT CAN COST ROUGHLY 1000 DOLLARS
I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF THE BIG IDEAS BEHIND IT AND WHY IT MATTERS SO MUCH
FOR MY PART I'D SAY IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT PROJECT I'VE EVER WORKED ON
JOIN ME IN TELLING INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE UN LIKE THE WORLD BANK LIKE THE WHO THAT
SOMETHING WAS NOT RIGHT BECAUSE I WASN'T PREACHING BECAUSE I WANTED TO CHANGE LIFE
AND I REMEMBER THAT DAY
WE WERE ABLE TO GET GAY MEN DRUG USERS SEX WORKERS IN THE AGENDA
AND DESPITE OUR LARGE PRESENCE INTROVERTS ARE NOT BEING ACKNOWLEDGED ENOUGH
GRADES ASSIGNMENTS HOMEWORK
I AM QUIET IN SCHOOL
THEY HAVE FOR YEARS BEEN FOCUSING ON CATERING TO THE DIFFERENT LEARNING TYPES WHETHER IT BE VISUAL AUDITORY
THE POWER OF INTROVERTS IN A WORLD THAT CAN'T STOP TALKING STATES IN HER OFFICIAL TED TALK THAT INTROVERTS
I WISH SHE SPOKE UP MORE
EVENTUALLY I WAS LEFT WONDERING
DO I HAVE TO CHANGE THE WAY I AM IN ORDER TO STOP BEING CALLED OUT BY TEACHERS FOR SOMETHING THAT COMES SO NATURALLY TO
HE ALSO HAD THE WONDERFUL FEAST OF DANCING AND FOOD AND IT WAS HIS TURN TO STAND IN
YOU MUST BE WONDERING ALL RIGHT SO WHAT ARE YOU UP TO NOW
SO I DID A STREET CASTING AND I APPROACHED A FEW HOMELESS PEOPLE
HE SAID YEAH
I KNEW THAT SAN FRANCISCO WAS THE TECH CAPITAL OF THE WORLD HOSTING MANY OF THE
YOU'RE GOING TO STOCKHOLM
OTHER STAKEHOLDERS WANT MORE TOURISTS AS WELL
BUT LET ME ASK THIS
IT'S NOT JUST THE AIRLINES AND THE HOTELS
AND IF TOURISM HOPES TO HAVE A LUCRATIVE FUTURE WE HAVE TO TREAT TOURISTS AND VISITORS WITH RESPECT
YOU WANT TO THINK OF IT MORE LIKE THIS
THE FIRST STEP IN DOING THAT IS FIGURING OUT HOW MANY VISITORS YOUR DESTINATION CAN ACTUALLY HOLD
WHICH IS THE TRADITIONAL WAY OF DOING IT
BETTER FOR THE TRAVELER BETTER FOR THE DESTINATION BETTER FOR THE STAKEHOLDERS
SOMETHING WE DON'T HAVE AT HOME
AND DESTINATIONS WANT TO OFFER SOMETHING DIFFERENT
THAT'S THEIR UNIQUE SELLING PROPOSITION
MOHAMED IS NOT SIMPLY SELLING FLOWERS
I BELIEVE HE IS SELLING HOPE
HE EVENTUALLY GETS MARRIED
OFTEN IT'S YOUTH WHO SUFFER FROM THE HIGHEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATES
THEY HAD NEVER REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT STARTING UP A BUSINESS
AND SO I DID THINGS LIKE TRAVEL TO SOUTH AFRICA WHERE I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO
I WANT TO SHARE SOME OF THOSE WITH YOU NOW
9 IDENTICAL IT'S SO APPEALING THAT THIS IDEA WAS SEIZED UPON BY
AM I MAKING THIS UP
LIKE THAT IS IT SPEAKS TO ME RIGHT
BUT ONCE YOU'VE FOUND THAT MOMENT WHERE YOU'RE FLOWING AND EVERYTHING
THE CELL WALLS LOOKED INTACT
AND THE KEY QUESTION FOR ME WAS TO ASK PETER HAS IT CHANGED
WE'VE LOST A WHOLE FAMILY
AND THAT WAS A WORRY
AND NORMALLY WHEN WATER FREEZES AS YOU KNOW IT EXPANDS AND THE SAME THING HAPPENS IN A CELL
THAT WAS A MIRACLE BUT IT WAS WORKABLE
THE GRASSLANDS WERE SWEEPING AWAY
THAT WAS NOT WHAT HAPPENED ACTUALLY
WE FOUND MARSUPIAL LIONS
THE GENETICISTS LAUGHED
IT WAS NEARLY 80 YEARS BEFORE THIS THAT HE'D BEEN AT THIS HUT
WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THIS
AND HE SAID NO
IT'LL GO ON AND PRODUCE A TADPOLE AND THEN A FROG
IN THOSE FOSSIL ROCKS ARE SOME AMAZING ANIMALS
IS THAT ALL WE WOULD DO
IT ACTUALLY DIDN'T LOOK BAD
WE SLAUGHTERED THEM
THEY THOUGHT THIS IS INCREDIBLE
AND JUST AS EVERYBODY GOT EXCITED ABOUT IT BANG
AND HE TOLD ME AS IT ALL WAS FLOODING BACK IN MEMORIES
THAT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF HOW I THINK ABOUT MYSELF
IN A WINNING ON A GAME SHOW ISN'T A HUGE DEAL IN THE GRANT SCHEME OF THINGS BUT
IT'S SOMETHING THAT MADE ME THINK OH I SHOULD GET A MASTER'S DEGREE IN ENGINEERING EVEN THOUGH I HAD BEEN AN ART
THAT'S WHAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT ABOUT MY PART IN THE CONVERSATION
I HOPE THAT ONE DAY PEOPLE WILL SEE ME MORE THE WAY I SEE MYSELF THAT I DIDN'T ACHIEVE THIS AS A
THEY BRING IN ABOUT A DOZEN PEOPLE TO PLAY
ALL I WAS EXPECTED TO DO WAS FOLLOW THE RULES AND PLAY TO WIN
IF WE ALL STARTED SAYING TO COMPANIES SHOW ME THE TRANSPARENT SUPPLY CHAIN TELL ME ABOUT THE LIVES AT
IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE
AND OUT FROM BEHIND A TREE COMES THIS HALF CRAZED MAN AND HE BEGINS CHASING YOU AND YOU'RE RUNNING AND YOU'RE
THEY HAD THE LOGIC
AND THEY ARE NOT
AND THAT IN MY OPINION WAS THE TRIGGER
THEY ARE THE THREE COUNTRIES THAT ARE IN THE END RECEIVING THE REFUGEES
HOW DO YOU IMAGINE THESE PEOPLE REACTING
I SAID ASTONISHING
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO ASK FOR HELP
BUT IT'S QUITE ASTONISHING HOW LITTLE TIME WE SPEND AT THIS CONVERSATIONAL FRONTIER
SO REALLY THIS FIRST RITUAL IS SAYING HOW DID YOU GET TO THIS PLACE
TWENTY THREE YEARS OLD AND YOU HAVE PAPER
TO BREAK YOUR HEART
YOU LOOK AT PARENTING YEAH
THE MOST POWERFUL MOMENT I HAD ON THE WHOLE CAMINO WAS WHEN I REALIZED I MYSELF
AND ONE OF THE DIFFICULTIES ABOUT WALKING INTO YOUR LIFE ABOUT COMING INTO THIS
I'M SORRY YOU HAVE CHOSEN THEM OUT UNCONSCIOUSLY FOR THAT EXACT CORE
SHE SAID I BURNED A LETTER AND TWO POSTCARDS
I SAID I WORK WITH THE CONVERSATIONAL NATURE OF REALITY
AND WHEN YOU GET TO SANTIAGO ACTUALLY IT CAN BE SOMETHING OF AN ANTICLIMAX BECAUSE
THE FIRST RITUAL IS TO EAT A TAPAS PLATE OF SCALLOPS OR IF YOU'RE
IT'S A WEEKLY TURNAROUND OF PRODUCTION
BUT IF WE CAN INCREASE THE OIL YIELDS OF ALGAE WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO MAKE THEM A FEASIBLE CONTENDER
SO WHAT THIS SEEMS TO MEAN IS THAT I SEEM TO HAVE CAUSED A LASTING GENETIC CHANGE IN MY ALGAE POPULATIONS
IT'S CLEAN IT'S CARBON NEUTRAL
AND THIS WAS THE IDEA THAT I WORKED ON DEVELOPING DESIGNING AND IMPLEMENTING OVER THE PAST
16 HOURS ON EIGHT HOURS OFF
TECHNIQUES THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO GO SMOOTHLY DON'T
THE THING IS THAT RESEARCH ISN'T EASY
I EVEN SLEEP ON MY ALGAE'S LIGHT CYCLE
I EMAILED PROFESSORS AND FACULTY MEMBERS AT UNIVERSITIES ASKING QUESTIONS BEGGING FOR LAB
ALGAE BIOFUELS JUST SIMPLY AREN'T COMPETITIVE WITH FOSSIL FUELS
TINY PROJECTS PAPER MACHE VOLCANOES NOTHING THAT TRULY SMACKED OF ACTUAL
BUT MY IDEAS ABOUT RESEARCH GOT TURNED ON THEIR HEAD WHEN I WENT TO MY FIRST SCIENCE
I FOUND THIS COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE WHO WERE ALSO LOVING SCIENCE WHO WERE DOING THEIR OWN
THEY WISHED THEY HAD GREATER ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY OF THE WORLD AND THEY WISHED IT WERE MORE EASY FOR THEM TO
CUBA LITERALLY HAS A PROGRAM OF TEACHING YOUNG PEOPLE ENVIRONMENTALISM IN THE SCHOOLS
THIS IS OF COURSE A HUMAN RIGHTS CONCERN FOR ANYONE LIKE MYSELF WHO MAKES IT THEIR LIFE'S FOCUS
I MYSELF HAD AN EMERGENCY IN THE PAST WEEK WHILE I WAS HERE IN CUBA
BUT IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO JUST SAY HOW EXCITING IT IS YOU HAVE TO DETERMINE WHICH DIRECTION YOU ARE GOING TO GO IN
HERE I THINK WE HAVE TWO PATHS THAT DIVERGE
BUT AT THE SAME TIME THAT ISN'T THE STORY THAT THE CUBAN PEOPLE I MET ALONG THE ROADS AND IN TOWNS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY
400 PEOPLE WITH MORE MONEY THAN 150 MILLION PEOPLE
AND IN FACT PRINCETON UNIVERSITY JUST A WEEK AGO PUBLISHED A STUDY SAYING THAT THE UNITED STATES IS IN FACT
AND AS YOU SEE ACROSS AMERICAN LIFE THIS KIND OF PAIN OF THAT SORT OF WEALTH DISTRIBUTION AND
3 TONNES SAVES THEMSELVES ABOUT 600
WHAT THEY SAY IS
WHO'S UP FOR THAT
ONLY RECENTLY HAVE I FIGURED OUT HOW TO USE THIS IN MY OWN WORK
I DO THIS THOUGH PAINTING SCULPTURE VIDEO AND PERFORMANCE
I SHOWED HIM A PHOTO OF A LYNCHING POSTCARD FROM THE EARLY 1900S AND REMINDED HIM THAT THESE KILLINGS HAVE BEEN GOING
I WAS CONSIDERED IMPURE AND FORBIDDEN FROM WORSHIPPING OR TOUCHING ANY OBJECT OF RELIGIOUS
GETTING SOME PROPER QUOTES
2 TO 1 JUST 10 YEARS AGO
THIS SORT OF THING IS HAPPENING MORE AND MORE
BUT OF COURSE THEY ARE NOT ALONE
THE WORLDS MEDIA DESCENDED ON THIS TOWN
THERE'S SOMETHING VERY STRANGE ABOUT THIS STORY
TAKING A BIT OF TIME
IN 2012 EL PA S SACKED ALMOST A 1 3 OF ITS EDITORIAL STAFF
SOMETIMES IT'S WHOLE STORIES THEMSELVES
THAT'S AN INCREASE FROM 3
IT'S A RECIPE FOR DISASTER
THERE WAS BLANKET COVERAGE
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE MINERS OF SOMA
THE TREMOR OCCURRED AT 9
HERE IS MY VIEW
IT SPENDS TIME WITH THE COMMUNITY GETS TO KNOW THEIR STORIES
IF YOU'VE CHECKED EVERY FACT
IF YOU HAVE REVISITED EVERY QUOTE
WOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN CAME UP AGAINST MANY OBJECTIONS AND MANY OBSTACLES ALONG THE WAY
I'LL GIVE YOU A CLUE
SPEAKING TO SOME PEOPLE
PUSHED THE BUTTON AND THE STORY WENT UP ONLINE
10 OF TWEETS DURING THAT HOUR CONCERNED HER DEATH
THAT'S 20 MILLION PEOPLE SPEAKING ABOUT AN EVENT BEFORE A SINGLE NEWS ORGANIZATION HAS PUBLISHED
IF YOU ARE PESSIMIST YOU MIGHT SAY
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SURVIVORS OF THE MV SEWOL IN KOREA
AND SITTING NEXT TO YOU ARE YOUR FRIENDS AND YOUR FAMILY
OUR TEACHERS OUR COACHES OUR PROFESSORS ALL SHOW US SOMETHING THAT WE DIDN'T KNOW BEFORE
ALL OF THESE CAN BE HALTED VERY EASILY AT THIS POINT BY TREATMENT
THIS DARK CELL
I COULD FEEL RODRIGO'S TOUCH WARM HANDS ON MY COLD BODY
I STAND IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY AS A LEGAL PERMANENT RESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
I FOUND TWO PURPLE LESIONS ON MY EITHER HANDS AND FOOT
I WAS GOING TO CHANGE MY LEGAL NAME FROM DEBANUJ DASGUPTA TO
I FOUGHT MY IMMIGRATION CASE
ON THE FIFTH NIGHT I COULDN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE
I AM SHACKLED MY LEGS AND ARMS AND TAKEN INTO A SINGLE CELL WHERE
I DIDN'T GIVE UP
THINK ABOUT ME DYING ALONE IN THAT HOSPITAL BED WITH MY FRIEND TRYING TO SAVE ME
AND PROBABLY HE THOUGHT THAT I HAVE TWO MASTER'S DEGREES
ICE FOUND ME AND DECLARED ME AS ILLEGAL
AT THIS POINT I AM BEING TAKEN INTO DETENTION
AT THIS POINT I KNEW I HAD KAPOSI SARCOMA AND PNEUMONIA
IN ORDER TO HELP YOU FLIP THE SCRIPT ABOUT UNDOCUMENTED
I MAY NOW HAVE ACCESS TO INSTITUTIONS OF AMAZING HIGHER LEARNING AND
WHAT WOULD I TELL THEM
THINK ABOUT ME ALONE SHACKLED IN A DETENTION CELL
IT IS TIME TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT
RECENTLY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP CALLED US ALL RAPISTS THIEVES AND
AS RECENTLY AS 2014 THEY POLLED 143 COUNTRIES AND THEY ASSIGNED EACH COUNTRY A POSITIVE
AND THE LOWEST SCORE ANY COUNTRY RECEIVED WAS A 47
A HUNDRED YEARS AGO WE TENDED TO DIE OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES LIKE PNEUMONIA THAT IF THEY TOOK HOLD WOULD TAKE US AWAY
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SURPRISED ME MOST IN MY RESEARCH THOUGH IS HOW CHANGEABLE ATTITUDES ACTUALLY ARE
THE 20TH CENTURY WAS THIS TIME OF HUGE OPTIMISM ABOUT WHAT SCIENCE COULD OFFER BUT WITH ALL OF THE FOCUS ON LIFE
WE NOW TEND TO DIE OF CANCER AND HEART DISEASE AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT MANY OF US WILL HAVE A LONG PERIOD OF
DURING THAT PERIOD WE'LL LIKELY SPEND A LOT OF TIME IN HOSPITALS AND HOSPICES AND CARE HOMES
SO I CONNECT THE EYE AND THEN I PLAY THE AUDIENCE'S FACES
THEY HAVE SIMILAR SOUND OF EYES
I THINK THIS WILL BE A BIG BIG CHANGE THAT WE WILL SEE DURING THIS CENTURY
SO YOU RELATE PEOPLE THAT YOU WOULDN'T RELATE AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY ALSO CREATE
I DIDN'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE NOTES
AND AFTER SOME TIME THIS PERCEPTION BECAME A FEELING
AND ALSO SOME RACHMANINOV PIANO CONCERTOS AS MAIN DISHES AND SOME BJORK OR MADONNA
I'M A MEMORY ATHLETE
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU THAT THAT IS ALL THE KNOWLEDGE YOU NEED TO FUNDAMENTALLY UNDERSTAND HOW YOUR MEMORY
I THINK IT'S EASY IF I SHOW YOU
THAT'S ONE OF THE EVENTS TO MEMORIZE WORDS
IT HAS A DOOR ON IT
THIS ONE I WILL REMEMBER
I KNOW HE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE JUST DID BEFORE
I MEAN YOU'VE NEVER BEEN INSIDE A SNAIL CELL
AND WHAT COMES AFTER HEARTS OF 10
WELL WE COMPETE IN MEMORY
BEFORE THAT I KNEW NOTHING
SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT I KNOW NOW
IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES THE FOLLOWING QUESTION
ARE WE READY TO ACCEPT THIS
WHY IS THAT
SO FROM THE MOMENT WE GET INTO MEDICAL SCHOOL IT'S A DEEP CULTURE OF COMPETITION
WHAT IT ALSO DOES IS IT LOOKS FOR LEVERAGE POINTS SMALL ACTIONS THAT HAVE
AT THE END OF A BUSY DAY WHEN I WAS AN HOUR BEHIND I LOOKED AT THE CLOCK IT WAS 4
ESSENTIALLY I WAS STILL CURIOUS
PUZZLED I SCROLLED THE IMAGES MYSELF
IT WAS MY PLAN
NOW SOME OF YOU IN THIS ROOM PROBABLY KNOW MY STORY
AT THE AGE OF 29
2 MILES EVERY SINGLE DAY
BUT WHY DID I TRAVEL ALL AROUND THE WORLD WITHOUT HOPPING ON A SINGLE PLANE
QUESTION WHY DID I TRAVEL
I REMEMBER LOOKING UP HOW MUCH A TYPICAL DESIGNER MAKES AND THINKING HOW CAN I AFFORD A NICE
WHAT ABOUT MONEY
WHAT ABOUT STABILITY
AND THOSE ARE THE BARRIERS WE WANT TO OVERCOME
AND YOU CAN SEE X RAY PHOTOGRAPHY UNDERNEATH SO THAT YOU CAN SEE A SIGNIFICANT RECOVERY
BMP2 IS A NATURAL SIGNAL THAT TELLS THE CELL TO TURN INTO BONE
WE CAN ACTUALLY CHANGE THOSE GENETIC DEFECTS THAT YOU'RE BORN WITH AND SOME PEOPLE
THIS IS MY SOLUTION
THE SECOND MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH DISCOVERY HAPPENED IN 2000 ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO
AND THIS IS MY THOUGHT
IT'S NOT EXACTLY AN EMBRYO
IT'S CALLED MUTATIONS
WITH BMP2 NATURAL SIGNALS SOAKED INTO A PIECE OF SPONGE AND PUT IT ON TO THAT
SO AFTER THREE MONTHS IT REMAINS LIKE A HOLE
IT HAPPENS IN CANCER PATIENTS
LET ME END MY THOUGHTS WITH THE FOLLOWING TWO SLIDES
BUT AT LEAST I THINK I GAVE YOU A RIGHT QUESTION TO PONDER ON
AND I THINK PEOPLE CAN REALIZE THAT WE ARE NOT REALLY BOUND BY
AND THAT TECHNOLOGY IS THE FIRST TECHNOLOGY THAT I JUST TOLD YOU ABOUT
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS DURING THE PROCESS OF WHAT WE CALL DEVELOPMENT
IT MAY BE BASED ON OUR GENOMES BUT IT MAY NOT BE OUR BODY ANYMORE
I AM NOT REALLY DEFINED BY MY BODY
IF YOUR HEART STOPS WORKING THEN YOU WILL HAVE A HEART DISEASE AND SKIN PROBLEMS THINGS LIKE THAT
IF YOU WERE GIVEN 150 YEARS OR 200 YEARS OR AS LONG AS YOU
WHY DID THEY STOP DIVIDING AND DIE
THAT MEANS OUR PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS ARE ALREADY IMPOSED
IN FACT EVEN AS OF NOW MY BODY CONSISTS OF 37 TRILLION CELLS I
WE PROMISE YOU THAT
BUT THIS PHENOMENAL PROJECT'S BEEN HAPPENING
PLACES LIKE SEATTLE HAVE INSTALLED ENTIRE PARKS THAT ARE EDIBLE
A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT CAN BE SEEN WITH WATER
WELL I WANT TO GIVE YOU SOME DATES
INSTEAD FACE HEAD ON THE FACT THAT THIS COUNTRY'S EXPERTISE IN SEGREGATION OPPRESSION AND RACISM
BUT WHEN SHE SHOWS A LESS MONOLITHIC CHARACTER OF HERSELF AND ULTIMATELY OF BLACK WOMEN WE DIDN'T LIKE THAT AS
OR ROSA PARKS
YOU'VE PUT IN THE HOURS YOU'VE DONE IT ENOUGH AND IT BECOMES SORT OF AUTOMATIC
YOU CAN CALL IT A DIGITAL ATHENS
AND THEN BAXTER GOES TO WORK FOR THE REST OF THE DAY
YOUR JOB IS TO MAXIMIZE IT
YOU FIGURE OUT HOW
THIS IS NOT HOW IT WORKS
AND WHAT CAN A CARTOONIST DO
I DID SOME RESEARCH
BUT IN THE BUILDUP TO AN ELECTION WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THAT YOU'RE GETTING CALLED ON THE PHONE AND BEING ASKED TO GIVE AWAY
PEOPLE CAN VOTE FOR WHOEVER THEY WANT
IF YOU WANT TO FIND OUT A POLITICIAN'S STANCE ON A POSITION MAKE THE POLLS INACCURATE AND YOU'LL FIND
HOW MANY OF YOU BECAME FAMILIAR WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE YOU VOTED FOR DURING THE DEBATES AT SOME POINT
IT TURNS OUT THE COMMISSION IS RUN AS A JOINT VENTURE BETWEEN THE REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC PARTIES
POLITICIANS CAN DO THAT BECAUSE THEY HAVE FAITH THAT THE POLLS ARE ACCURATE
THEY WANT TO FIND OUT THEY ASK PEOPLE THAT'S FINE YOU SHOULD GIVE THE CORRECT ANSWER THEN
PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW HOW TO VOTE FOR A BILL
IF THE POLLS TELL THEM THE RIGHT LIE THEN ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS ALWAYS GIVE THE RIGHT LIE
SO TO DRAW IT ALL BACK WHAT I'M ASKING YOU TO DO OVERALL IS TO THINK ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES THAT YOUR ANSWERS HAVE
REMEMBER THE UPROAR WHEN FACEBOOK STARTING MESSING WITH THEIR PRIVACY SETTINGS
SO WHEN THEY ASK YOU WHO YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR WHAT THEY'RE REALLY ASKING IS WHO DO YOU WANT TO SEE AND WE ALREADY KNOW THAT THE SHOW IS RUN
IT WOULD JUST THROW AWAY MY VOTE
MAYBE THERE'S A DIFFERENT WAY TO DO THAT
WHEN DO YOU SEE PEOPLE
WHY WOULD YOU VOTE FOR SOMEBODY YOU HAVEN'T SEEN SOMEBODY YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO KNOW
HOW DO WE GET TO KNOW THESE PEOPLE HOW DO WE GET TO SEE THEM
WHEN I WAS RESEARCHING THIS EXPERIENCE I THOUGHT THIS IS LIKE A FOOTNOTE IN LIFE RIGHT
I PULLED UP A BUNCH OF THE EMAILS I'VE BEEN WRITING AT THAT TIME I FOUND THE ONE I WROTE TO MY AGENT WHEN I FINALLY HAD MADE THE DECISION AND SAID
IT WAS THE FULFILLMENT OF LITERALLY A LIFELONG DREAM
AND I WANTED TO GET IN THE MINDSET OF WHAT THAT FELT LIKE BECAUSE I AM AN ACTOR AND I WANTED TO ACCESS THOSE EMOTIONS
PLEASE KNOW THAT IT IS NOT IMPULSIVE BUT COMES AFTER MANY MONTHS OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO WITH MY LIFE
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THIS WILL BE PERMANENT
I ACTUALLY TOOK PROFESSOR CHUN'S CLASS WHEN I WAS AT YALE
THIS IS REALLY EXCITING
AND ON THE OUTSIDE YOU KNOW EVERYTHING WAS GOING GREAT
AND SORT OF ALL SEEMED TO BE POINTING IN THAT ONE DIRECTION
BECAUSE ON ONE HAND YOU KNOW IT WAS AMAZING
THE GREAT THING ABOUT A SIMPLE IDEA IS THAT YOU DON'T NEED A LOT TO ACCOMPLISH IT
THEN WE LEARNED THAT HAMMOCKING ACTUALLY HAS HEALTH BENEFITS AND WE STARTED TO WORK WITH ACTUAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS TO TRACK SWAY
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A MOCK YACHT CLUB WHERE WE WORE SPERRYS AND TALK ABOUT BOATING AND JUST LIKE BE REALLY CHILL
OUR GOAL WAS ONLY 50 DOLLARS SO REALLY WASN'T THAT HARD TO DO BUT TO BEING RIDICULOUS LIKE
WE HAD SO MUCH INTEREST WE HAD TO HAVE END OF THE YEAR BANQUET WHERE EVERYONE IN ATTENDANCE GOT AN AWARD IT WAS A
WE GOT OTHER FRIENDS AND OTHER HIGH SCHOOLS INVOLVED AND WE ENDED UP HOSTING THE MIDWEST HIGH SCHOOL CROQUET
WE BRING IN MONTHLY GUEST SPEAKERS
WE DO CHARITY EVENTS
WE'VE PROVEN THAT THE HUMAN FAMILY CAN COME TOGETHER AND SEND A MESSAGE FAR BRIGHTER AND MORE
AND FOR SOME IT WAS TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN THE OLDER AND THE YOUNGER GENERATION WHICH BY THE WAY IS SOMETHING THAT MANY FAITHS
AND THEN FROM THAT POINT ON IT WASN'T VERY HARD FOR ME TO FIND INSECURE ENVIRONMENTS TO WORK IN BECAUSE THE WORLD WAS
OUR SENSE OF ISOLATION GROWS BECAUSE OUR IMAGINATION GOES INTO OVERDRIVE ABOUT THE PEOPLE AND THE
MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS STEPPED FORWARD AND HELPED WITH PERMITS AND WITH CONVENING CIVIL SOCIETY
IT'S BECOMING MORE PERVASIVE
I'LL MAKE IT UP TO YOU TOMORROW
WELL WHERE DO YOU THINK WE ARE GOING TO BE 5 YEARS FROM NOW
EVENING NUMBER 2
YOU THINK 2015 2016 REPRESENT A CHALLENGE
WELL YOU KNOW WHAT ACTUALLY I HAVE A STAFF MEMBER THAT I CAN DELEGATE THAT RIGHT OVER TO YOU
NOW THERE ARE POSITIVES TO THIS
THE FIRST EVENING TAKES PLACE AND WAS MUCH MORE TYPICAL BEFORE MY HAWAII TRIP
I'M ACTUALLY ABOUT TO GO AND DO A BEDTIME ROUTINE WITH MY KIDS TONIGHT
SEVERAL OF US CAN CHECK THINGS LIKE THE WEATHER REPORTS THE LOCAL ART EXHIBITS COMING TO TOWN WONDERFUL INFORMATION
AND YOU ARE LIKING IT AND YOU ARE SHARING IT AND EVERYTHING BUT YOU REALIZED YOU HAVEN'T ACTUALLY SEEN THAT PERSON
I WAS GOING ON VACATION TO HAWAII SPECIFICALLY THE WEST COAST OF MAUI
WELL I DON'T KNOW I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT HAPPENED TO GANDALF
HE FELL A LONG WAY
OK NOW LET ME START READING
IT'S A REAL THING I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HEARD IT
BUT SHE WAS ALSO A MAVERICK IN HER USE OF TECHNOLOGY IN THE CLASSROOM
SHE HAD TERMINAL BREAST CANCER
I DOCUMENT WHAT THESE GROUPS DO WHEN THEY'RE NOT SHOOTING
THEY THOUGHT THAT THIS WOULD MAKE HIRING MORE OBJECTIVE LESS BIASED AND GIVE WOMEN AND
I RESEARCHED THIS AND FOUND THIS WAS A WIDESPREAD PROBLEM
REMEMBER FOR THINGS YOU HAVEN'T EVEN DISCLOSED
I ALWAYS WENT
WAS IT MY FACEBOOK FRIENDS
THERE'S NO RIGHT ANSWER
THEY MAKE MISTAKES BUT THAT'S EXACTLY MY POINT
AND SHE TURNED AROUND AND WALKED AWAY
IT'S A COMMERCIAL BLACK BOX
THEY WERE SUPER EXCITED
I WAS TROUBLED
IT'S ETHICS ALL THE WAY DOWN
ARE AIRPLANES SAFER
MY INNER STRIPPER WAS VERY STRONG
THE DOCTORS SAID THAT I WOULDN'T WALK BUT I AM HERE IN FRONT OF YOU
MY BIG BREAK CAME IN 2010
SO I BECAME A COMIC
YOU CAN'T CATCH IT
I DON'T THINK ANYONE EVEN NOTICED WE WEREN'T ITALIAN
HOWEVER IF I GREW UP WITH SOCIAL MEDIA I DON'T THINK I WOULD BE
WHAT DOES SHE SUFFER FROM
YO IS SHE RETARDED
I HOPE THAT TOGETHER WE CAN CREATE MORE POSITIVE IMAGES OF DISABILITY IN THE MEDIA
I GREW UP WATCHING WHOOPI GOLDBERG ROSEANNE BARR ELLEN AND ALL OF THESE WOMEN HAD ONE THING IN
BUT NOT ONLY DID MR
SUDDENLY MY DISABILITY ON THE WORLD WIDE WEB IS FAIR GAME
COME ON A JOURNEY WITH ME
HOLLYWOOD HAS A SORDID HISTORY OF CASTING ABLE BODIED ACTORS TO PLAY DISABLED
AND I KNEW THAT I WOULD BE PROMOTED FROM DINER DINER TO WACKY BEST FRIEND
I PROCRASTINATED BY SCROLLING THROUGH MY NEWS FEED
WE EQUATE BEING A GIVER SOLELY WITH THAT SECOND TYPE
AND I LOVED IT
I'M ASSUMING THAT WE ALL WANT TO LIVE HAPPY LIVES RIGHT
GIRLS WHO WERE TOLD THEY WERE TOO SENSITIVE TOO MUCH
NOW YOU CAN SAY THAT WHAT YOU ARE EATING IS NOT ONLY SWEET BUT A SWEET PEACH FLAVORED JELLY
BUT IF WE DO NOT WANT TO SMELL WE CANNOT CLOSE OUR NOSES BECAUSE IF WE CLOSE OUR NOSES WE CANNOT BREATHE
IT DEPENDS ON A GROUP OF GENES THAT REGULATE YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM
A SELFIE WHATEVER
THE PERSON NEXT TO YOU
IT'S A PROPER NOUN
WHAT IS IT REALLY
YOU KNOW BAD IDEA
AND HE HAPPENED TO TELL ME ABOUT A CONFERENCE HE'D JUST RETURNED FROM IN ISRAEL WHERE THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT A NEW TYPE OF
AND I'M VERY HAPPY TO REPORT THAT WE'RE NOW USING A DOSE OF RADIATION THAT IS EQUIVALENT TO THE EFFECTIVE DOSE FROM ONE
WHAT ABOUT ULTRASOUND
YOU MAY BE SURPRISED TO KNOW THAT MAMMOGRAPHY IS THE ONLY RADIOLOGIC STUDY THAT'S REGULATED BY
BUT FOR WOMEN WITH DENSE BREASTS WE SHOULDN'T ABANDON SCREENING ALTOGETHER WE NEED TO OFFER THEM SOMETHING
WE NEED TO INDIVIDUALIZE SCREENING BASED ON DENSITY
FOR WOMEN WITHOUT DENSE BREASTS MAMMOGRAPHY IS THE BEST CHOICE
ULTRASOUND GENERATES MORE BIOPSIES THAT ARE UNNECESSARY RELATIVE TO OTHER TECHNOLOGIES SO IT'S NOT WIDELY
SHE AND I WERE BOTH VERY PREGNANT AT THAT TIME AND MY HEART JUST ACHED FOR HER IMAGINING HOW
IF YOU DON'T YOU'RE NOT ALONE
BOTH TUMORS AND DENSE BREAST TISSUE APPEAR WHITE ON A MAMMOGRAM AND THE X RAY OFTEN
BECAUSE METHANE IS A GREENHOUSE GAS HOWEVER THE HALF
WHAT IF I WERE RIGHT
LET ME ILLUSTRATE THIS FOR YOU
WHY IS THAT
THIS WAS STAGGERING
WHEN LASH AFFIRMED MY CALCULATIONS THE FIRST SALVO OF THE FRACKING
WITHOUT THEIR EFFORTS THIS WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE
I WAS TAKING CARE OF FIRST SECOND THIRD AND FOURTH GENERATION OF FILIPINOS JAPANESE CHINESE AND
EXCEPT WHEN THEY WENT TO BATTLE THEN THEY'D SWITCH TO QUINOA AND IF YOU GO TO THE MIDDLE EAST THESE PEOPLE ARE FROM THE BREAD BASKETS OF THE
HOW CAN WE EVER GET AHEAD
TRIM HEALTHY HARDY PEOPLE
THAT S WHAT THEY LOOKED LIKE
BECAUSE THE RICH WESTERN DIET FEEDS THEM A DIET OF KINGS AND QUEENS
I KNEW WHAT A REAL DOCTOR DID
SOMEHOW IT S OKAY FOR THE KIDS TO BE SICK
THE PHILIPPINES JAPAN CHINA KOREA
AND THEN AS TIME WENT ON MORE AND MORE PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO EAT LIKE KINGS AND QUEENS
BUT THERE IS A DIET FOR HUMAN BEINGS
I COULD FULFILL WHAT I WANTED TO DO AS A PHYSICIAN WHICH IS TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE BY APPLYING THIS VERY
YOU RECALL KING HENRY 8TH AND HIS COURT
AND THEN AS TIME WENT ON WE BECAME MORE EFFICIENT AT GATHERING FOOD
CAN T YOU SEE IT
THE SURGEON GENERAL S REPORT OF 1964 CHANGED AMERICA
IT CHANGED THE WESTERN WORLD
AND THINK ABOUT THESE PEOPLE
I WENT BACK TO OAHU TO BECOME A BOARD CERTIFIED INTERNIST
JULIEA BAKER DECIDED AT 17 YEARS OLD SHE WAS GOING TO CHANGE HER DIET
YOU SAY I CAN DO THAT
WE HAD THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION IN ITS MIDST OF 150 YEARS AGO
WE CAN WORK HARD TO GET OUR EMPLOYEES HEALTHY
AND THEY WOULDN T GET WELL
HE HAD TERRIBLE CHEST PAINS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE DIABETES HIGH CHOLESTEROL
SO I TOOK A JOB ON THE BIG ISLAND AS A PLANTATION DOCTOR
OCTOBER 21ST 2012
PEOPLE BECAME WEALTHIER
ANOTHER EVERYDAY DEATH IS WHEN YOU GET A REJECTION LETTER THE FIFTH ONE
I'M THE BOSS
SO TWO THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN YOU'RE CONFRONTED WITH YOUR MONSTER
SO I WENT BACK TO MY RESEARCH WHICH IS MY SAFE SPACE
AND IF WE DON'T MANAGE THESE WELL WE'RE NOT LIVING WELL
AND HOW DO WE RUN
YOU'LL WANT TO GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE
ASSUME THE POSITION
NOW WHY DOES THIS WORK
THE SECOND THING THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO RUN
MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST QUIT
AN EVERYDAY DEATH IS WHEN YOU'RE IN A MEETING AND YOUR BOSS CALLS ON YOU TO EXPOUND UPON A POINT MAYBE ON A PROJECT BUT YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
A LOT OF PEOPLE IN MY IMMEDIATE FAMILY WERE DYING AND THEY WERE DYING BACK TO BACK TO BACK
AND THEY WEREN'T OLD
I THINK INEQUALITY UP TO A POINT CAN ACTUALLY BE USEFUL FOR INNOVATION AND GROWTH
SO RIGHT NOW THE MOST CAPITAL INTENSIVE SECTORS IN THE ECONOMY ARE THE REAL ESTATE SECTOR
WHAT DO YOU ANSWER TO THAT
SOME MADE BAD INVESTMENTS
SO THERE MUST BE OTHER REASONS FOR ACCUMULATING WEALTH THAN JUST LIFE CYCLE TO EXPLAIN WHAT WE SEE IN THE
SOME FAMILIES MAKE HUGE CAPITAL GAINS
IT'S LOCATED IN DURBAN IN SOUTH AFRICA
REMEMBER IT TOOK THREE MONTHS TO DIAGNOSE EBOLA
IT'S ONE OF THE POOREST PARTS OF SOUTH AFRICA AND IT'S ALSO THE EPICENTER OF THE HIV PANDEMIC
WOULDN'T IT HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLE IF WE COULD HAVE DETECTED EBOLA THREE MONTHS EARLIER WHEN IT FIRST
IN FACT ALL RACES AND ALL NATIONS ARE SUSCEPTIBLE
THE HUMAN CONSEQUENCES COULD BE DEVASTATING
PEOPLE STOP GOING TO WORK
AND PERLMAN RETURNED MY PHONE CALL
IT BREAKS DOWN THE FUNDAMENTALS THE CRITICAL ACTIONS A TEAM NEEDS TO GO THROUGH WHEN A WOMAN COMES IN IN
THAT'S NOT THE EMPLOYER'S JOB
SHE'S EVEN HIRED ANOTHER RELAUNCHER FOR WORK FOR HER
THINK ABOUT HOW FAR WE HAVE COME
I FOUND POWERPOINT MUCH MORE CHALLENGING BUT NOW I USE POWERPOINT ALL THE TIME
EMPLOYERS CAN VIEW HIRING PEOPLE WITH A GAP ON THEIR R SUM AS A HIGH RISK PROPOSITION
THEY'VE PAID FOR HER TO GET HER MBA AT NIGHT
SO LET ME TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED WITH TRACY SHAPIRO
NOW MY GOAL IS TO BRING THE REENTRY INTERNSHIP CONCEPT TO MORE AND MORE
AND THERE'S NO REASON WHY THERE CAN'T BE A RETIREE INTERNSHIP PROGRAM
DIFFERENT POOL SAME CONCEPT
I TELL RELAUNCHERS THAT EMPLOYERS EXPECT THEM TO COME TO THE TABLE WITH A WORKING
SHE WAS LOOKING FOR A FINANCE OR ACCOUNTING ROLE AND SHE HAD JUST SPENT THE LAST NINE MONTHS
THE FIRST THING I TOLD TRACY WAS SHE HAD TO GET OUT OF THE HOUSE
A LOT OF THE COMMANDS ARE THE SAME
IT SERVES TO PROVIDE PEER SUPPORT FOR THOSE TRYING TO REBOOT THEIR SEXUALITY BY GOING LONG PERIODS OF TIME OFTEN MONTHS
WELL BUILDING AND MAINTAINING A LONG TERM RELATIONSHIP OR A MARRIAGE CAN ALREADY BE CHALLENGING
NOW I GREW UP CHRISTIAN AND I CERTAINLY IDENTIFY AS CHRISTIAN TODAY
AND WE GET A SENSE OF JUST HOW BIG OF A DEAL PORNOGRAPHY REALLY ITS
THUS ITS NOVELTY NOT SIMPLY SEX IN GENERAL THAT FROM A BIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE DOMINATED MALE AROUSAL
THIS QUICKLY SPIRALS DOWNWARDS AS VIEWERS PURSUE EVER MORE EXTREME PORN TO GET THE SAME HIGH
WHAT ABOUT ALL THE SLUMS
THAT MEANS WE HAVE TO TAKE A SECOND LOOK AT NUCLEAR POWER
WE SAVE NATURE BY NOT USING IT BY NOT NEEDING IT
WHEN IT'S BOUNCED ON THE MOON WE SEE IT
THE SAME THING IN THE DARKROOM
WE SEE WHERE IT'S BOUNCING BUT WE DON'T SEE THEM AS THEY EXIST
THIS HAS INTRIGUING IMPLICATIONS
AND THEN HAVE A WORKSHOP ABOUT IT BRING ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS INTO A ROOM BRING EVERYBODY THAT WOULD BE
WE KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF CONTINUING TO HUNT AND GATHER FOSSIL SOURCES OF ENERGY
WHAT WE LEARNED WITH THE 108 MILLION DOLLARS WAS A WAY TO MAKE AN ECONOMICALLY AND
WE HAVE A GOOD SOURCE PLACE FOR WATER WE HAVE PLENTY OF WASTEWATER WE CAN HELP YOU FIND A SOURCE OF CO2
AND WE GOT PRETTY FAR ALONG
AND BY THE WAY I DON'T MEAN TO BE BIASED AND SHOW JUST A MAN BECAUSE IN FACT WOMEN WERE
WHAT ARE WE DOING FOR OUR ENERGY
OF COURSE WE USE HYDROPOWER WE USE SOLAR POWER WE USE NUCLEAR POWER
AND THIS IS REALLY THE POINT
WHY IS THAT THOSE VACCINES ARE JUST GOING INTO CLINICAL TRIALS NOW
AND VACCINES ARE OUR BEST DEFENSE
WELL PARTIALLY BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY DIFFICULT OR THOUGHT TO BE DIFFICULT TO WEAPONIZE THE VIRUS BUT
WE MAY HAVE IT SOMEDAY
IN FACT IT'S MUCH LESS TRANSMISSIBLE THAN VIRUSES SUCH AS FLU OR
AND IN FACT WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD VACCINE CANDIDATES AVAILABLE NOW FOR MORE THAN A DECADE
AT LEAST IF WE DON'T RECOVER THE SENSE OF WONDER WE WON'T BE ABLE TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE
WE CHECK OUR SMARTPHONE 1500 TIMES PER WEEK
AND NUMBER THREE
THERE ARE MANY THINGS OUT THERE THAT CAN BE AWESOME
AND ALL THESE DISTRACTIONS MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT TO CAPTURE WHAT IS REALLY IN FRONT OF US
ISN'T THAT TOO MUCH
I SWITCHED MY MAJOR ABOUT 4 TIMES BEFORE FINALLY LANDING ON INTERNATIONAL STUDIES AND EVENTUALLY CHOOSING PUBLIC HEALTH
ONE I'D ALWAYS STRUGGLED WITH SELF CONFIDENCE AND I WOULD SET MY STANDARDS FOR MYSELF SO HIGH THAT ANYTIME
HOW DID I TURN MY LIFE AROUND
SO WHAT IS MEDITATION
WHAT THIS TAUGHT ME WAS I HAD COME TO POINT WHERE I HATED SILENCE
IT'S WRITER'S BLOCK IT'S NOT UNDERSTANDING A CONCEPT AT SCHOOL
MY MOM STARTED SHORTLY AFTER THEY GOT MARRIED
THAT'S WHERE I REALIZED I WAS GOING WRONG
LET ME BACK UP A LITTLE BIT
BUT THOSE WERE TEMPORARY SATISFACTIONS
FOR ALL THESE DECADES I'VE BEEN TRYING TO LOOK FOR MORE SENSIBLE ANSWERS AND TO GIVE INSECTS AND THE
AND THAT'S A REAL SHAME BECAUSE THESE GUYS HAVE GOT PROTEIN THAT CONTAINS VIRTUALLY NO CHOLESTEROL IS VERY HIGH
SO WE NEED TO PUT ECO' BACK INTO ECONOMICS
WHERE DID YOU GET THE POLLEN ON YOUR BACK
GOD INVENTED CARPET BEETLES WELL BEFORE SHE INVENTED CARPETS
THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF FIGURES AND THEY'RE IMPRESSIVE FIGURES
I MIGRATED INDEED I DID
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT THOUGH
SOME POLLINATORS ARE VERY LIBERAL IN WHAT THEY POLLINATE OTHERS ARE VERY SPECIFIC I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE
AREN'T YOU LUCKY YOU WEREN'T RAISED IN AN ANT'S NEST
WE DON'T MIND INVERTEBRATES FROM THE SEA WE CALL THOSE
AND PEOPLE SAY
WHO EATS THAT
THE HARLEQUIN BEETLE FROM VENEZUELA HAS ITS OWN SPECIES OF PSEUDOSCORPION AND IT'S ACTUALLY MORE KINKIER
THAT'S WHERE I'M LEAVING THAT
HOW DO I KILL THIS
WHERE DID YOU FIND THAT ORCHID AND HOW DO I GET THERE
THERE'S STUFF GOING ON ON THIS PLANET OF OURS THAT WE HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT
THAT WAY WE ALLOW TO BECOME A LITTLE BIT OF AN ALMOST 100 CLEAN AND GREEN COUNTRY BY GROWING OUR FOOD AT LEAST
ROBERT COSTANZA IN 1997
HOW DO YOU SPELL THAT
I SAID EXCUSE ME
HOW DO I ERADICATE ANTS FROM MY GARDEN
BUT ERADICATE IS A BIG WORD
UNTIL HE'S GOT ABOUT 12 UP THERE
AND HOW DO YOU GET THE RECEPTORS
THIS IS WHAT THEY DISCOVERED
HE FALLS IN LOVE AND A RESEARCHER WALKS UP SAYING CONGRATULATIONS
THEY TESTED THEIR TESTOSTERONE
AND HERE'S THE CATCH
REMEMBER WHAT SHE SAID
NOW WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
I SAID CERTAIN NEUROTRANSMITTERS GO UP CERTAIN ONES GO DOWN
I SAID SOME MAY HAVE A TIPPING POINT REACTION
THAT'S WHY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS
THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION SAYS THE AVERAGE BODY MASS INDEX IS 21
WHAT DOES IT TELL US
CAN WE CHANGE THE MEDIA
IT VERY MUCH DOES
SO THE WAY TO HIGH PERFORMANCE IS TO ALTERNATE BETWEEN THE LEARNING ZONE AND THE PERFORMANCE ZONE PURPOSEFULLY
WE FOCUS ALL OUR TIME ON JUST DOING OUR JOB PERFORMING WHICH TURNS OUT NOT TO BE A GREAT WAY TO IMPROVE
WE'LL LEARN FROM YOUR MISTAKES
FOR EXAMPLE WE MIGHT FIND A MENTOR OR A TRUSTED COLLEAGUE WITH WHOM WE CAN EXCHANGE IDEAS OR HAVE VULNERABLE
IT'S A SPIRAL TO EVER INCREASING CAPABILITIES BUT WE NEED TO KNOW WHEN WE SEEK TO LEARN AND WHEN WE SEEK TO
A TIGHTROPE WALKER DOESN'T PRACTICE NEW TRICKS WITHOUT A NET UNDERNEATH AND AN ATHLETE WOULDN'T SET OUT TO FIRST TRY A NEW MOVE
THE BEST SALESPEOPLE AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK DO ACTIVITIES WITH THE GOAL OF IMPROVEMENT
OF COURSE HE STUDIED A LOT
HE STUDIED LAW AND PHILOSOPHY WITH GUIDANCE FROM MENTORS BUT HE ALSO REALIZED THAT BEING A LAWYER
THIS HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE TRUE IN TEACHING GENERAL MEDICINE NURSING AND OTHER FIELDS AND IT HAPPENS BECAUSE
IT DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT
SO A SOCIAL TRANSITION INVOLVES ESSENTIALLY THE COMING OUT PROCESS
ALLY IS NO LONGER A NOUN
AND THIS CAN RANGE ANYWHERE FROM 5000 DOLLARS ON THE LOW END OF THE VARIOUS SURGICAL PROCEDURES
UNTIL I WAS ABOUT 23 24 YEARS OLD
TAKE PEOPLE AT THEIR FACE VALUE
NOW LOTS OF PEOPLE KNOW LAVERNE COX WHICH IS WHY I BRING HER UP OFTEN WHEN I DO TRAININGS ABOUT TRANSGENDER
AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT BINARY IDENTITY IDEAS TRY TO CHALLENGE THOSE
THERE ARE OTHER FOLKS WHO TRANSITIONED FROM MALE TO FEMALE
AND THAT WAS OK FOR A WHILE
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OFTEN MEDICALLY NECESSARY CARE THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO PAY FOR THEMSELVES
BUT I HAD NO IDEA HOW TO TALK ABOUT THAT
AND THEN COMMUNICATING THAT TO OTHER PEOPLE
SHE IDENTIFIES IN THE SAME WAY AS HER CHARACTER
IT'S ALL RIGHT WE'LL ALL GET THROUGH IT TOGETHER
I HAD FINALLY FOUND THE WORDS TO UNDERSTAND MYSELF THROUGH THE WORDS OF SOMEONE ELSE
SO THERE ARE SOME FOLKS WHO SAY I DON'T NEED THAT
WE'LL GO BACK TO THE WORD TRANSEXUAL
BE OK WITH THAT
BUT I WILL CAUTION YOU THAT THE TERM TRANSSEXUAL IS PROBABLY NOT THE BEST WORD THAT YOU SHOULD USE ON A DAY TO DAY
I AM GENDERLESS OR GENDER IS AT LEAST NOT A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF MY LIFE IT'S NOT A WAY THAT I THINK OF MYSELF
SOMEONE SAYS THAT THIS IS HOW THEY IDENTIFY BE COOL WITH THAT
SO WHAT DOES ALL OF THIS MEAN
HOW DO I THINK ABOUT MY GENDER
ONE DAY WHILE I WAS JUST ROAMING THROUGH LIVEJOURNAL BORED AFTER CLASS I FOUND A
I HAD FINALLY FOUND LANGUAGE
SPEAK UP FOR US WHEN WE CAN'T MAYBE DO IT FOR OURSELVES
IT'S NOT COVERED UNDER HEALTH INSURANCE OFTEN SO IT'S OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES
THEY MAKE SENSE WE DON'T HAVE TO CHALLENGE A BUNCH OF STUFF TO TALK ABOUT BINARY IDENTITIES LIKE I
I EXISTED IN SORT OF A TOMBOY SPACE FOR MOST OF MY YOUNG ADULTHOOD OR MY YOUNG
SO IF THESE WORDS YOU'VE NEVER HEARD THESE BEFORE I'M NOT SURPRISED
AND THAT WAS THE HEADLINE ON THE COVER OF THE MAGAZINE THAT MONTH AND THEY PAIRED THAT WITH A PHOTO OF
SO IT'S NOT FOR EVERYONE NOT EVERY TRANS PERSON GOES THROUGH A TRANSITION IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY
LET ME SITUATE MYSELF IN THIS CONVERSATION
THEY SAY SCREW YOUR IDEAS ABOUT GENDER
SOME FOLKS IN THE COMMUNITY SAY THAT'S THE WORD THAT I USE THAT'S HOW I UNDERSTAND MY GENDER
IT MEANS THAT YOU'RE NOT SO SELF CONSCIOUS THAT YOU CAN'T OBSERVE THE EFFECT THAT YOU'RE HAVING ON THE OTHER PERSON
IT'S THINGS TO DO RATHER THAN HOW WE OFTEN SEE FLIRTING WHICH IS A
BUT AS YOU GO DOWN THE ARM TOWARDS THE HANDS THE TOUCH GETS MORE
SOUND FAMILIAR ANYONE
SO AS PART OF MY QUEST TO HELP PEOPLE BECOME BETTER FLIRTS I DID RESEARCH
BECAUSE IF WE CAN MAYBE WE HAVE A CHANCE OF ACTUALLY DISCOVERING LIFE SOMEWHERE ELSE WITHOUT BEING
AND SO NOW WE CAN SEE IS THAT REALLY A ROBUST SIGNATURE
NOT AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED
BECAUSE THESE THINGS DON'T EVOLVE BY THEMSELVES
BUT OF COURSE THERE'S ANOTHER STORY TO THIS BUILDING
AND THE DETAILED QUALITY OF EVERYTHING WE DESIGNED WAS ABOUT ANIMATING THE SPACE AND GIVING THE SPACE TO THE
OF COURSE ARCHITECTURE IS ABOUT FUNCTION BUT I WANT TO REMEMBER A REWRITING OF THIS PHRASE BY BERNARD TSCHUMI
SO WE STOPPED WORK FOR A WHILE AND SAT DOWN AND CUT 10000 LITTLE STICKS AND GLUED THEM ONTO A MODEL
AND I THINK THAT COULD BE ONE OF ITS PRIMARY MEANINGS THAT WE BELIEVE IN
ONE IN TWO HUNDRED PATIENTS ARE SEVERELY HARMED
YOU FOLLOW YOUR PRESCRIBED THERAPY AS A BASELINE AND SPEAK UP WHEN YOU THINK SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE
THEY MAY LITERALLY GO BLIND
DON'T BE ONE OF THEM
THEREFORE YOU GET OPTIMAL RESULTS WHEN YOU WORK TOGETHER AS A TEAM
WRONG DIAGNOSES ARE MOSTLY CAUSED BY TUNNEL VISION
THE FIFTH AND FINAL STEP IS WHEN YOU'RE BACK HOME
OR IN OTHER WORDS WHAT ROOM IN MY HOUSE
AND THIS SCORE HAS NOT A SINGLE NOTE WRITTEN AND THERE IS NOT A SINGLE NOTE PLAYED
OR HOW COULD HE
OR NO HE DIDN'T
IN ETHIOPIA BIRDS ARE CONSIDERED AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE ORIGIN OF MUSIC ITSELF
AND YARED EVENTUALLY RECOGNIZED AS SAINT YARED USED THESE SCALES TO COMPOSE FIVE VOLUMES OF
MUSICIAN AND NATURAL SOUNDSCAPE EXPERT BERNIE KRAUSE DESCRIBES HOW A HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT HAS ANIMALS AND
YOU MIGHT GET SOME EXPERTS FROM AROUND THE WORLD
WE'LL HAVE THAT SUPERMARKET SPECIAL OFFER
SO IF YOU WANTED TO CREATE A GLOBAL BRAND YOU'D START WITH A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE
I GUESS WHAT WE ALL WANT IS FOR DEMOCRACY TO REALLY SUCCEED
NOW WHAT GOOD BRANDING DOES IS IT DOES MANAGE TO CONNECT WITH PEOPLE TO TOUCH PEOPLE ON THEIR
AND OFTEN WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT BRANDS THEY CAN FORGET THAT SOME OF THE WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL BRANDS MOST INFLUENTIAL BRANDS
THEN WE'LL TEST YOUR KIDS EVERY YEAR TO SEE HOW THEY'RE DOING
WHAT WE SHOULD BE SAYING AS A SOCIETY TO PARENTS WHO ARE CONSIDERING DIVORCE IS WE JUST DON'T KNOW
WE ALL ABSORB THESE SOCIAL NARRATIVES FROM AN EARLY AGE AND WE HARDLY EVER QUESTION THEM
BUT I DON'T WANT YOU AROUND IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE MISERABLE
THE FACT THAT OUR SOCIETY TRIES SO HARD TO HAVE IT BOTH WAYS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF A
I DID HAVE SOME GREAT INITIAL SUPPORT
I WOULD RECITE THEM TO MY MOM SOMETIMES AND SHE WOULD SAY YEAH THAT'S GREAT HONEY JUST DON'T SAY THAT IN FRONT OF
SO AS FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED I HAD THE SUPPORT AND THE RESOURCES I NEEDED
NOBODY TOLD ME TO DO THIS I HAD THE IDEA ON MY OWN AND I CARRIED IT THROUGH ON MY OWN
BUT I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE STOPPED AND THOUGHT
I WENT TO MY FRIEND JAMILA AND SHE SAID ONLY IF I CAN PLAY HORATIO
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE REALLY TERRIBLE EXPERIENCES WITH SHAKESPEARE BECAUSE THEY FIRST LEARN ABOUT HIM
WE WERE DOING SHAKESPEARE TOGETHER IN MY BACKYARD WE WERE WORKING ON THIS AMAZING MATERIAL
AND WE HAD FUN
I DID TAKE A CLASS ON SHAKESPEARE AND I HAD TO WRITE ESSAYS ABOUT HIS PLAYS WHICH I VERY ENJOYED BY THE
AND IT WASN'T JUST ME I WAS WATCHING MY FRIENDS MOST OF THEM WHO HAD NEVER BEEN IN PLAYS BEFORE
I WOULD EVEN MEMORIZE LINES FROM SOME OF THE PLAYS LIKE ONE TIME SHE WAS IN THIS PLAY CALLED SLAVS BY TONY
WE PERFORMED HAMLET IN MY BACKYARD AND PEOPLE CAME AND ENJOYED IT
HOLD ON I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO EXPERIENCE WITH ANY OF THIS
I PLAYED JUROR NUMBER 3
I HAVE SOME FRIENDS
WE DID 12 ANGRY WOMEN I'M GOING TO PUT ON HAMLET
BUT EVEN HIGH SCHOOL
I SAID I'M DOING GREAT
HE SAID WONDERFUL
AND WERE WILLING TO RESPOND TO THE NEEDS THAT COMMUNITIES TOLD US ABOUT
FOR THE FIRST TIME COUPLES ARE ABLE TO PLAN THEIR FAMILIES
AND THIS APPEARS TO BE STRENGTHENING THEIR ENGAGEMENT IN MARINE CONSERVATION
WE BECAME A CONSERVATION ORGANIZATION THAT DARED TO THINK DIFFERENTLY
AS A PRACTICING DOCTOR MYSELF I'M CONSTANTLY REMINDED OF THE IMPORTANCE OF LISTENING
YET WHAT I'D SEEN IN MADAGASCAR STAYED WITH ME LONG AFTER I RETURNED HOME
THESE COMMUNITIES WERE SO REMOTE
AND I NEVER FORGOT THAT AND TO THIS DAY I STILL TAKE THOSE WORDS VERY MUCH TO HEART AND
SO YOU KNOW PEOPLE WERE WRITING ME AND SAYING HOW'S YOUR NEW JOB
AND SO I SAID LET'S PUT THIS TOGETHER IN AN ALBUM
I WAS LIKE I DON'T KNOW
AND THE PERSON WHO DIDN'T IT TURNED OUT HAD JUST MOVED TO A NEW CITY AND TAKEN ON A NEW JOB
THIS WAS CONNECTING RIGHT
THIS WAS AT A DISTANCE REALIZING THAT SOMEONE WAS FEELING SOMETHING WANTING TO AFFECT THEM IN A PARTICULAR WAY
THIS WAS INCREDIBLE THIS IS WHAT I WANTED TO DO
BUT NONETHELESS IF YOU'RE A COLLEGE KID AND YOU HAVE NO MONEY BELIEVE ME THIS IS BETTER THAN TRYING TO USE YOUR
THE IPHONE CAME OUT THAT DAY
ONE WAS FROM A GUY NAMED MICHAEL STEVENSON WHICH SHOULDN'T BE THAT HARD TO TRANSCRIBE AND IT WAS MISSPELLED
SO I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU SOMETHING EVEN BETTER
AND IT'S SO INTERESTING THAT I THOUGHT I WOULD TELL YOU ABOUT IT
FINALLY CINGULAR SAID OK
THEY DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF MONEY
AND THEY SAID OH MY GOSH MAYBE WE'VE BEEN DOING IT WRONG
IT'S TOTALLY FREE THERE'S NOT EVEN ADS
IT COULD BE ANYTHING
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REALIZE THIS
IT'D BE REALLY REALLY COOL AND YET EVEN THOUGH THE TECHNOLOGY FOR THIS HAS BEEN AVAILABLE FOR FIVE YEARS
YOU'RE THINKING WELL HOW OFTEN AM I IN A HOTSPOT
THE NEW YORK TIMES HAS VERY RIGID POLICIES ABOUT THAT
I KNOW THE PEOPLE WHO WORKED ON THE TREO
I'M NOT PLUGGING T MOBILE
THEY HAVE COVERAGE LIKE THE SIZE OF MY THUMBNAIL
HOW CAN IT BE SO GOOD
NAILED THAT ONE
BY THE WAY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT REALLY BOTHERS ME
YOU WILL PAY
I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE EFFECT OF THE IPHONE
I GOT TWO VOICEMAIL MESSAGES
AND WHEN YOU'RE OUT OF THE HOTSPOT YOU'RE ON THE REGULAR CELLULAR NETWORK
IT COMES FROM T MOBILE
AND I AM NOT PAID BY T MOBILE
THIS IS MY FAVORITE OF ALL TIME
THE BEAUTY OF THAT IS YOU NEVER MISS A CALL
NOBODY OVER 40 KNOWS HOW TO DO THAT
IT COULD BE SALSA MUSIC OR A COMEDY ROUTINE IT DOESN'T MATTER
CAN I CALL YOU RIGHT BACK
WOULD YOU CALL ME PLEASE RIGHT NOW
ANYWAY BUT THIS TEACHES PEOPLE WHAT IT'S LIKE
AND DON'T YOU ALL CALL ME AT THREE A
I WANT TO FIND WHAT
THAT'S WHO CAN AFFORD TO DO THAT
SIMILARLY I FOUND OUT THE GERMAN WORD FOR NIPPLE IS BRUSTWARZE
AND SO WHILST GERMAN TAUGHT ME A LINK BETWEEN MATHS AND POETRY THAT I HADN'T PREVIOUSLY BEEN ABLE TO IMAGINE IT
I REMEMBER ASKING MY HOUSEMATES WHAT THE GERMAN WORD FOR A KETTLE WAS
AND THEY SAID DAS IST EIN WASSERKOCHER
AND MEASURING YOUR PROGRESS ON THAT JOURNEY USING VERB TABLES AND GRAMMAR EXAMS WHILST HELPFUL FOR
SO I BEGAN TO SET UP MY OWN MILESTONES FOR WHEN I KNEW THAT I WAS MAKING PROGRESS
AND IN MANY WAYS GERMAN IS QUITE A LOGICAL AND MATHEMATICAL LANGUAGE
WE'LL NEVER SEE THROUGH IT IT'S OPAQUE TO LIGHT
VISIBLE LIGHT HAS A WAVELENGTH A SIZE THAT'S MUCH SMALLER THAN THE THINGS AROUND YOU THE FEATURES ON
THAT'S BOB INTERRUPTING
THE PROBLEM IS ALL THE INTERESTING PHYSICS HAPPENS IN THE CORE AND THE CORE IS HIDDEN BEHIND THOUSANDS OF KILOMETERS OF
NOW PROGRAMMING FOR THOSE OF YOU HERE THAT HAVEN'T DONE IT YOURSELF REQUIRES LAYING OUT IN
FOR EXAMPLE THESE FOUR ALGORITHMS WERE ALL BUILT BY THE SAME GUY
WE'RE MOSTLY DONE BUILDING IT AND NOW WE'RE TESTING IT
FOR EXAMPLE TRANSLATING A TINY FRACTION OF THE WHOLE WEB WIKIPEDIA INTO ONE OTHER LANGUAGE SPANISH
BUT AT ALL TIMES YOU'RE LEARNING BY DOING
NOW THE PROBLEM IS THAT OCR IS NOT PERFECT
WE COULD DO THAT
UNFORTUNATELY IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE
THINK ABOUT THE LAST US ELECTION AND HOW PEOPLE WOULD ALIGN THEMSELVES WITH THE MOST OPPOSITE EXTREMES
THE PEOPLE WHO WERE ABLE TO DISREGARD THEIR IDENTITY AS A REPUBLICAN OR A DEMOCRAT AND FOCUSED ON THE ISSUES AND
WHILE THIS BINARY WAY OF THINKING MAY BE USEFUL AND UNAVOIDABLE IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES IN OTHERS ESPECIALLY WHEN
WHAT HE FOUND WAS THAT THE LEGISLATORS THAT WERE MOST EFFECTIVE WERE THE ONES MOST WILLING TO FIND COMMON GROUND
I THINK THIS IS A HARD QUESTION
WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO MOVE BEYOND BINARY THINKING FOR OURSELVES AND FOR WORKING TOGETHER
SO WHAT ARE THE STEPS THAT WE CAN TAKE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS
WITH THIS WAY OF THINKING THERE'S NO SPECTRUM NO GRAY AREA AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THERE'S NO COMMON GROUND
RARELY IS SOMEONE EVER LABELED AS BEING JUST OKAY AT MATH OR A MEDIOCRE ATHLETE
FOR INSTANCE PEOPLE SEE AND LABEL THEMSELVES AS EITHER SHY OR OUTGOING SMART OR DUMB A
PEOPLE THINK ABOUT ISSUES AND ANSWERS IN BINARIES AS WELL
NOW IF THESE WERE RANDOM DOODLES OR DECORATIONS WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE A LOT MORE VARIATION BUT INSTEAD WHAT WE
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THOSE EARLY WRITING SYSTEMS DIDN'T COME OUT OF A VACUUM
SO WHILE HE FILMED ME I KEPT FOLLOWING THE TRAIL OF RED PAINT WITH A SINGLE LIGHT AND A POINT AND SHOOT
THEY WERE THE ORIGINAL SHOULDERS
AND AFTER THE MOMENT OF TRANSMISSION IT'S GONE FOREVER
YOU CAN ONLY DO IT IN AMSTERDAM WHERE THE STORY ORIGINATED
WE STARTED A FOUNDATION THAT DOES EXACTLY THAT
AND NOW 55 YEARS LATER THAT SAME FOUNDATION ASKED US TO
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY
AND WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS THE TINY DIMMING OF LIGHT THAT IS CAUSED BY A PLANET PASSING IN
I'VE GOT THESE SLIDES THAT I HAVE TO USE SO THAT'S ONE RULE I'VE GOT THESE SLIDES IN ORDER
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH EVERYONE
WHAT PLAY BECOMES AS WE GET OLDER AS WE TAKE IT MORE SERIOUSLY IT BECOMES THE OPPOSITE OF PLAY WHICH IS WORK WHICH EVERYBODY
LET ME DEFINE WHAT I MEAN BY GAME HERE
I'M SURE WE ALL KNOW WHAT IMPROVISATION IS RIGHT
WE JUST DID THAT
BECAUSE BUT IS A CONTRADICTION WHEREAS AND IS SOME SORT OF CONNECTION
YEAH THERE YOU ARE SEXY
MY FIRST ALBUM WAS RECEIVED VERY WELL IN COLOMBIA
INSTEAD OF SAYING A DUTCH GIRL PLAYING SALSA THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT
BECAUSE THERE'S NO QUESTION WHERE I HAVE MY DOCUMENTS IF THEY ARE LYING ON MY DESK IF I HAVE THEM IN THE DRAWER
A FEW YEARS AGO I PRINTED OUT A 750 PAGE TUTORIAL HOW TO
I HAD THE FEELING THAT I NEEDED TO GO OUT OF MY COMFORT ZONE THAT I'D WORK FURTHER ON MY NEW COMPANY
I DID IT MYSELF
SO TODAY IS THE DAY OF THE EXPONENTIAL CHANGE CONFERENCE AND I'M SURE WE HEAR A LOT OF REALLY INTERESTING
I'M 100 MOBILE I HAVE NO SETTLED DOMICILE BUT MAYBE THAT'S ANOTHER TED TALK
I'M MUCH MORE INTERESTED IN THE BIGGER SCALE
AND THAT'S THE REASON WHY YOU WANT TO KEEP IT
I TRIED IT A FEW TIMES BECAUSE I WANTED TO FLY AS HIM
IT NEVER QUITE WORKED ACTUALLY
I WAS CUTTING THE LAWN AND I WAS WATERING THE FLOWERS AND STUFF AND FROM MY FIRST SALARY I BOUGHT
BUT WHAT WE HEAR LESS ABOUT IS THAT THERE'S SUCH A THING AS ADULT DEVELOPMENT AND OUR 20S ARE THAT CRITICAL
NOW WHEN I HEARD THIS I WAS SO RELIEVED
MOMENTS THAT MAKE YOUR LIFE WHAT IT IS WILL HAVE HAPPENED BY YOUR MID 30S
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS WHEN YOU PAT A TWENTYSOMETHING ON THE HEAD AND YOU SAY YOU HAVE 10 EXTRA YEARS TO START YOUR
SHE LOVES HER NEW CAREER SHE LOVES HER NEW FAMILY AND SHE SENT ME A CARD THAT SAID NOW THE
MY CLASSMATE GOT AN ARSONIST FOR HER FIRST CLIENT
IT'S A STORY ABOUT A WOMAN NAMED EMMA
PEOPLE WHO ARE OVER 40 DON'T PANIC
BUT I DIDN'T HANDLE IT
THAT'S WHAT PSYCHOLOGISTS CALL AN AHA
THAT WAS THE MOMENT I REALIZED 30 IS NOT THE NEW 20
MAY WE ALWAYS KEEP IT EVER CLOSE TO OUR HEARTS
SPENCER'S FORM WAS NOT ONLY GENIUS IN ITS APPEARANCE BUT IT WAS A THING OF BRILLIANCE IN
THERE WERE OTHERS THAT FOLLOWED IN SPENCER'S PEN STROKES
OF COURSE I PRACTICED MY ARTWORK AND MY HANDWRITING INCESSANTLY SO MUCH SO THAT I GAINED A
AND HE SAYS THEY'RE THEIR PERSONNEL RECORDS
AND HE SAID WELL YOU FOUND THEM
I THINK THERE ARE TWO PARTS OF THIS
WHAT IF THE ENEMY FINDS OUT
WE HAD TO CHANGE OUR CULTURE ABOUT INFORMATION
WE HAD TO SHARE
BUT AS I WAS TALKING TO MY INTELLIGENCE OFFICER I SAID WHAT DO WE DO
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR OUR MUSIC AND OUR LANGUAGE
IT'S A 50 50 CHANCE RIGHT
WE THINK INFORMATION IS POWER
WE MAY NOT KNOW HOW OR WHAT BUT IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFERENT THAN IT WAS
WHAT DID I ASK YOU TO DO
SUPPOSE I HAD SAID
AND I TELL THEM YOU CAN'T
I DID STUDY THEOLOGY
I'M NOT HELPING THEM AVOID DOING THE WRONG THINGS THEY ARE SMART ENOUGH TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY NEED TO DO IN THEIR BUSINESS
THAT MAKES A LITTLE BUMP ON YOUR BMP
AND SHE IS PAVING THE WAY AND SHOWING WHAT'S
AND FOR ME SPACE IS THAT WHITE AREA LEFT ON THAT MAP IT'S THE PLACE WE STILL HAVE
AND OVER A HUNDRED APPLICATIONS CAME IN
BUT OH HOW THEY CRAVED THEM
MAYBE I'D BE EMBARRASSED
I'M ACTUALLY A VEGETARIAN SO IT'S EVEN FUNNIER FOR ME
YOU DON'T WANT TO FALL IN THAT YOU'LL NEVER COME OUT
I COULD TOTALLY BLOW IT
IT'S SORT OF ILLOGICAL WE SHOULD WANT TO PRESERVE OURSELVES SO WE GET TO THAT RIPE OLD AGE BUT NO
THIS FEELS GOOD
I WANTED TO PUT UP A SLIDE OF A STEAK JUST BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUNNY BUT I DIDN'T GET AROUND TO DOING THAT
IT'S SORT OF A METHODOLOGY THAT I CREATED I CALL IT THE M
WE FELT GOOD ABOUT THE SITUATION
METHOD IS MITIGATE
AVALANCHES OF COURSE
YOU CAN GO BACK IN HISTORY AND EVERYBODY HAS DONE THINGS WRONG
BUT WHAT'S THE WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN
THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS THAT CAN BE RISKY
IT'S KIND OF RISKY STANDING UP HERE ON THE STAGE RIGHT NOW
I SHARE THIS WITH YOU NOT TO BRAG BUT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT EVEN WITH ALL OF THAT
PERFECTIONISTS LOOK TO SEE HOW FAR THEY HAVE GOT TO GO
UNTIL YOU LOOK BACK AND NOTICE ALL THOSE MOMENTS MISSING JOY
PERFECTIONISM COMES IN MANY COLOURS BUT IT SPEAKS THE LANGUAGE OF BLACK OR WHITE
IF YOU ARE LIKE ME YOU MIGHT NOT REALISE YOU HAVE THIS UNTIL IT IS TOO LATE
PERFECTIONISTS ARE TERRIFIED OF MAKING A MISTAKE AND ARE SO THREATENED BY THE SUCCESS OF OTHERS
AND WE STOPPED TRYING TO BE PERFECTIONISTS AND AS MY TEACHER AND THOUGHT LEADER TAL BEN SHAHAR SAYS
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE EVOLVED OUR THINKING
WE ALSO GET TO STRETCH THE BELIEF AND KNOWLEDGE OF JUST HOW MUCH WE ARE CAPABLE OF
YOU LOOK AT ALL THOSE RELATIONSHIPS DAMAGED OR DESTROYED BECAUSE YOU WERE TOO BUSY BEING PERFECT TO BE
I JUST NEVER KNEW WHEN IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN OR WHERE
I HAVE WON PRETTY MUCH EVERY FITNESS ACCOLADE THAT THERE IS TO WIN AND I HAVE EVEN BEEN ON THE BACK OF A SPECIAL K
WHEN THE TALK AROUND TOWN ABOUT MY FATHER BEING A DRUNK WAS NO LONGER JUST GOSSIP AND I THOUGHT THAT EVERYONE EVERYWHERE KNEW
FOR A FEW THIS MIGHT BE TRUE
PERFECTIONISTS STRIVE TO BE FLAWLESS THEY SEE THEIR MISTAKES AS A CHARACTER FLAW
WE CAN'T DO THIS
WE GAVE HER THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME TO THE CLASS
THEY WERE ALL IN A CIRCLE
AS I WENT BACK EVERY TIME I WENT I FOUND THAT MY NEIGHBORS' GIRLS WERE GETTING MARRIED
I GOT A SCHOLARSHIP BUT I NEEDED TO GET MYSELF HERE
I TALKED TO MY FATHER
SO HE FIGURED OUT
AND THE DAY BEFORE THE ACTUAL CEREMONY HAPPENS WE WERE DANCING HAVING EXCITEMENT AND
THE SAME YEAR WE CONVICTED 220 TAX EVADERS
WE SHOULD BE PUSHING BACK AGAINST THE INSECURITY
I WANT TO ASK YOU TO THINK ABOUT SOMETHING
IT'S BEEN TRIED IN KENYA IT'S BEEN TRIED IN NAMIBIA IT'S BEEN TRIED IN NORTH CAROLINA U
A JOB FOR LIFE
AT THE RSA WE'VE DONE THE SUMS
THEY MIGHT HAVE MISSED A BUS MIGHT HAVE SOME CARING RESPONSIBILITIES MIGHT JUST BE A BIT LATE
IT WAS TRIED IN INDIA
PIECING IT TOGETHER YOU UNDERSTAND THE INSECURITY THAT PEOPLE ARE FACING
IT'S ABOUT US AS PEOPLE
ADDS TO THE INSECURITY
THE INSECURITY IS LIKELY TO SPREAD
THE PLATFORM WE NEED IS SOMETHING CALLED UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME
PEOPLE STAYED IN EDUCATION LONGER GOT MORE QUALIFICATIONS
WE SHOULD BOSS THIS CITY
IT'S WORKING IN ALASKA
THE FINNISH GOVERNMENT HAS SAID WE WANT TO TRY A BASIC INCOME
THEY'RE GOING TO TRY IT NEXT YEAR AS WELL
IT'S ABOUT WORK
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
IF THERE ARE DOCTORS LAWYERS AND ACCOUNTANTS IN THE AUDIENCE YOU'RE NOT SAFE EITHER
WE SHOULD BE THE BOSS OF OURSELVES
ALASKA IS ONE OF THE MOST EQUAL U
THEY LOSE MONEY
NOW LET ME TELL YOU THE REALITY
FINLAND SWITZERLAND THE NETHERLANDS U
OVER A MILLION
WE WANT TO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT
THEIR WELL BEING WAS GREATER
I'M FEELING VERY HAPPY EVERYDAY
WE DON'T USE DECIMAL PLACES TO DESCRIBE THE TEMPERATURE
I'LL USE ONE LAST EXAMPLE HERE
AS SOON AS IT'S BURIED IN A CHART IT FEELS LIKE SOME KIND OF OBJECTIVE SCIENCE AND IT'S NOT
PEOPLE ARE REALLY RELUCTANT TO ANSWER THEIR PHONES TO POLLSTERS AND ALSO SHOCKINGLY ENOUGH PEOPLE MIGHT LIE
WHEN YOU HEAR A STATISTIC YOU MIGHT FEEL SKEPTICAL
FIND OUT HOW THEY COLLECTED THE NUMBERS
DO PEOPLE REGRET THEIR TATTOOS
QUESTIONS LIKE IS IT NORMAL TO SLEEP IN A SEPARATE BED TO MY WIFE
THEY'RE CIVIL SERVANTS
I WANTED TO SHOW PEOPLE THE WAY DATA RELATES TO THEIR EVERYDAY LIVES
BUT YOU WOULDN'T NECESSARILY KNOW THAT TO LOOK AT THE MEDIA
HOW CAN WE HAVE PUBLIC DEBATE ABOUT IMMIGRATION IF WE CAN'T AT LEAST AGREE ON HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ENTERING AND LEAVING THE COUNTRY
SO I BECAME A DATA JOURNALIST
BUT YOU SHOULD ALSO BE ABLE TO TELL WHICH NUMBERS ARE RELIABLE AND WHICH ONES AREN'T
SO THAT WHEN WE ASK CAN A COMPUTER WRITE POETRY
BUT WE SHOULD ALSO BE ASKING OURSELVES WHAT IDEA OF THE HUMAN DO WE WANT TO HAVE REFLECTED BACK TO US
WE SHOW IT WILLIAM BLAKE THAT'S WHAT IT REFLECTS BACK TO US
IT'S JUST RAW MATERIAL
WE'RE ALSO ASKING WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE HUMAN AND HOW DO WE PUT BOUNDARIES AROUND THIS CATEGORY
SO THAT WHEN WE BEGIN TO GRAPPLE WITH THE IDEAS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE FUTURE WE
I ALSO BELIEVE THAT ALAN TURING UNDERSTOOD THIS AND THAT WHEN HE DEVISED HIS TEST BACK IN
WE SHOW IT GERTRUDE STEIN WHAT WE GET BACK IS GERTRUDE STEIN
CAN WE BUILD A CREATIVE COMPUTER
SO WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE IS MORE OR LESS A REVERSE TURING TEST
CAN A COMPUTER WRITE POETRY
BUT IF YOU'RE FEELING A LITTLE BIT UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THIS ANSWER THAT'S OK
SO YOU'D BE SURPRISED TO FIND THAT POEM 1 WAS WRITTEN BY THE VERY HUMAN POET
HE HAS NO CHOICE
THEY WERE EXACTLY RIGHT
THERE'S SO MUCH INFORMATION OUT THERE
I HAD TAKEN SOME ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CLASSES
THE ADVANTAGE OF VOLUME FIRST JUST HAS TO DO WITH THE COMPLEXITY OF THE WORLD NOWADAYS
I'VE MET A LOT OF THEM
WHAT SHOULD I MAJOR IN
WHO DO I VOTE FOR
WATSON'S ACTUALLY HUGE
I MEAN NINE YEARS IS A LONG TIME
SO ME AND ALL MY FRIENDS WOULD RUN HOME EVERY DAY AND WATCH JEOPARDY
I WAS ALWAYS THAT KIND OF OBSESSED TRIVIA KID
SO KIND OF IT WAS THE WANNABE WRITER'S DREAM RIGHT
ONE OF THEM IS BAD
ONE THE MOST DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH TO SURVIVE
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE FACTS WE SEE SOMETHING DIFFERENT
SO WHAT DID THEY DO
ONE OF THEM IS GOOD
SO IF WE LOOK AT THE SYSTEM WE NEED TO SEE
DOES IT FEEL RIGHT
IT IS THE ARGUMENT OF THE HEART
AND ONE EVENING I WAS SITTING NEXT TO A VERY NICE GENTLEMAN IN KABUL AND HE ASKED WHAT I THOUGHT WOULD BE
YET THERE IS HOPE
SOMEBODY HAS TO FEEL HOW YOU FELT
AND I WANT TO ENGAGE MYSELF IN THE BRIGHT FUTURE FOR MY CHILDREN AND THE CHILDREN OF MY CHILDREN AND I WILL
BUT I REALISE SOMETIMES LATER THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER LESSON AND THAT LESSON WAS THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE
THAT'S A WIN WIN WIN WIN
NOW IS IN A VERY ENCOURAGING DEBATE AND THIS IS OF ONE EXAMPLE OF MANY MANY DIFFERENT
AND WE ENACT THOSE FREE TRAITS
THAT'S WHERE I'M GOING NOW
THE INTROVERTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO SPEND TIME IN THE QUIET SPACES UP ON THE SECOND FLOOR WHERE THEY ARE ABLE
I'M A PROFESSOR
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE KNOW THIS
LET ME DEAL IN A BIT MORE DETAIL WITH EXTROVERSION BECAUSE IT'S CONSEQUENTIAL AND IT'S
THEY ALL GATHER TOGETHER
AND I'VE SEEN YOU
OH OK SO YOU DO DATE THEM
WE SEPARATE FROM THEM
WELL THEY'RE JUST JEALOUS OR THEY NEVER HAD A GOOD RELATIONSHIP
WE HAVE TO BE HAPPY WITH OURSELVES WE HAVE TO BE HAPPY WITH OUR PRESENCE AND HAPPINESS WILL COME TO
AND WE MAY EVEN ADMIT TO OURSELVES
WHO DOES SHE FALL IN LOVE WITH
WE HAVE TO BE BOLDER
SO THE ISSUE IS YOUR FOCUS THE ISSUE IS YOUR PERSPECTIVE
I WANT THIS KIND OF PERSON WHO DOES THIS AND WHO IS INTERESTED IN THIS
SO WHY DO YOU CHOOSE THEM
NO JUST RUN
AND SO WHAT DO WE DO
BUT WE DON'T
THEY TELL HER THEY'RE AFFECTIONATE THEY WRITE POEMS THEY SING SONGS ALL THIS WONDERFUL STUFF
WHEN YOU WANT TO PUNCH SOMEBODY AND THEN YOU REALIZE
BE BRAVE ENOUGH TO WALK AWAY
WELL LET ME JUST PUT IT OUT THERE
OH WHATEVER MAKES YOU HAPPY
WE GOT MARRIED
OH BUT THEY HAVE SO MUCH POTENTIAL AND WE HAVE SO MUCH IN COMMON
WE FIGURED THAT OUT SO QUICK
YEAH I PROBABLY SHOULD END IT
TALK TO A PROFESSIONAL A CONSULTANT A THERAPIST ANYONE JUST TALK TO SOMEONE ELSE TO
DO WE THINK WE HAVE TO SETTLE FOR THIS PERSON
IS THAT REALLY IMPORTANT
I DON'T DATE THE PETER PAN GUYS
I'M REALLY SERIOUS
I WANT TO FIX THIS PROBLEM
DON'T LIE TO YOURSELF AND TELL YOURSELF
HOW DO I DO THIS
OH MY GOSH THEY GOING TO THINK I AM CRAZY MAYBE THAT'S A PROBLEM
DO WE THINK WE ARE NOT WORTH IT
SO I WANT TO BEGIN WITH AN EVERYDAY STORY
SOME EVEN SAID I HAD A POLITICAL MOTIVE
SOME ARE JUST LIKE I WAS
WE HAVE 30 EMPLOYEES AND MANUFACTURE A VARIETY OF PLASTIC PARTS
WE HAVE TO CAPTURE THAT KNOWLEDGE AND HELP THESE RETIRING WORKERS TO PASS IT ON TO THE NEXT
WITH CTE STUDENTS STUDY CAREERS IN INDUSTRY AND BUSINESS AND CONNECT WITH PEOPLE IN THOSE
THEN WE BUMP IT UP
WHEN YOU PICK IT OUT OF YOUR DRAWER IN THE MORNING WHAT SHOULD I WEAR
BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE YOU GET THAT MONEY FIRST
I HAVE TWO REASONS WHY THAT IS
BY NO MEANS DID I HAVE MONEY
THEY DON'T WANT TO SEEM BORING
FOR ONE THING IT'S VERY HARD TO KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD BE MEASURING OR WHAT YOU SHOULD BE QUANTIFYING
SO THOSE ARE MY TOP THREE TIPS OF HOW MATHS CAN HELP YOU WITH LOVE AND RELATIONSHIPS
NOW I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT GOOD MARRIAGES WERE ABOUT COMPROMISE AND UNDERSTANDING AND ALLOWING THE PERSON TO
BUT ACTUALLY THIS IS THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT YOU SHOULD DO IF YOU WANT TO BE SUCCESSFUL
GOTTMAN OBSERVED HUNDREDS OF COUPLES HAVING A CONVERSATION AND RECORDED WELL
SO I HOPE THAT PERHAPS FOR JUST A COUPLE OF YOU A LITTLE BIT OF INSIGHT INTO THE MATHEMATICS OF LOVE CAN PERSUADE YOU TO HAVE A
NOW OF COURSE IT TAKES A BIT MORE THAN JUST A LOW NEGATIVITY THRESHOLD AND NOT
THE BEST COUPLES OR THE MOST SUCCESSFUL COUPLES ARE THE ONES WITH A REALLY LOW NEGATIVITY THRESHOLD
BECAUSE FOR ME EQUATIONS AND SYMBOLS AREN'T JUST A THING
SO I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL RELATIONSHIPS WERE ONES WHERE THERE WAS A REALLY HIGH NEGATIVITY
WHERE COUPLES LET THINGS GO AND ONLY BROUGHT THINGS UP IF THEY REALLY WERE A BIG DEAL
BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT MATHEMATICS HASN'T GOT SOMETHING THAT IT CAN OFFER US BECAUSE
BUT SOME OTHER PEOPLE I
BUT THE WAY THAT PEOPLE WOULD VOTE WOULD BE VERY DIFFERENT
AS I DO THEY START LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY THEY SAY WE'VE A BIG GUY IN THE BACK THAT NEEDS TO GET IN SHAPE WILL YOU LOOK AFTER HIM
FROM A DISTANCE YOU SAW A GROUP DOING EXERCISES AND RUNNING BETWEEN CONES BUT REALLY WHAT IT WAS ABOUT WAS
THE GUARDS PULL UP AT THE END OF THE SESSION PUT DOWN THE WINDOW THEY SAY PAT LOCK YOUR BIKE GRAB YOUR
EVENTUALLY CURIOSITY GOT THE BETTER OF HIM
THAT'S THE POWER THAT ONE CONVERSATION CAN HAVE AND ONE INTERACTION CAN HAVE
THAT ONE CONVERSATION RESULTED IN A QUARTER OF A MILLION FOR CHARITY AND THAT ONE CONVERSATION RESULTED IN 200000 PEOPLE A
I WENT TO THE BEACH AND I TRIED TO GIVE THAT TO FIVE MORE PEOPLE
THAT ONE CONVERSATION RESULTED IN HUNDRED OF CLIENTS IN GALWAY AND THAT ONE CONVERSATION RESULTED IN THOUSANDS OF CLIENTS
I TURN AROUND TO PICK UP MY THINGS
I ADVERTISED THE FITNESS CLASS DOWN ON THE LOCAL BEACH
PEOPLE LATER TOLD ME THAT WAS GENIUS OUTDOOR TRAINING
WE ARE COMING BACK FOR YOU DON'T GO ANYWHERE
THEIR BRAIN IS ON FIRE WITH YET
THEY ENGAGE DEEPLY
THAT HAS FAILED
I STEPPED OFF BOARDS I ELIMINATED COMMITMENTS
I GOT QUIET
I STOPPED BEING THE CEO OF THE COMPANY THAT I COFOUNDED
NOW TELL ME WHY DO WE NEED 24 FLAVORS OF RANCH DRESSING
AND I TAKE THEM HOME IN THEIR FANCY PACKAGING AND I STAND IN FRONT OF THE FULL LENGTH MIRROR
SO WE WERE WORKING ALL THE TIME
WHEN WE CHOOSE NOT TO GIVE WE ARE CUTTING OFF SOMEBODY ELSE'S OPPORTUNITIES AND THEREFORE WE'RE
SO FIND YOUR PASSION NOT SOMETHING I CARE ABOUT NOT SOMETHING THE PERSON SITTING NEXT TO YOU CARES
I WOULD SAY IT WAS LIKE LOSING A LOVED ONE BECAUSE I SUFFERED TERRIBLE GRIEF AND I KEPT
AND AT THAT POINT IN TIME I FIGURED I HAD NO CHOICE BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO
AND WAS EXTREMELY FED UP WITH SOCIETY HOW PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS WANTING PEOPLE ALWAYS EXPECTING IN A
THEY CAN TURN THEMSELVES AROUND
AND AT THE SAME TIME I THOUGHT I WAS LOSING MY MIND BECAUSE I WAS EVEN THINKING LIKE THAT
I REFUSED TO USE HEALTHY ALTERNATIVES TO DEAL WITH OR REDUCE MY STRESS AND I CONTINUED BURYING ALL
ALWAYS LEAD BY EXAMPLE
AND SOMETIMES YOU NEED TO STEP OUT OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE
WE ARE ALL JUST ONE SMALL DROP IN THIS VAST OCEAN OF HUMANITY AND ONE
BECAUSE PEOPLE CAN CHANGE
AND YOU COULD BE THE PERSON WHO HAS THE POSITIVE EFFECT ON SOMEONE THAT MAKES THEM STOP AND THINK IT'S WORTH IT
AND I GAINED INSIGHT AND I REALISED THAT THERE IS ALWAYS HOPE
WE NEVER REALLY KNOW WHAT'S INSIDE
HOW WILL THAT MATTER
AND I HAVE A NICE PLACE TO LIVE
THE MAJORITY OF US ALL HAVE
IS AN INDIVIDUAL CAPABLE OF CHANGE
THERE ARE A LOT OF FACTORS THAT MUST BE IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME BUT CHANGE CAN HAPPEN
BLACKS CAN VOTE IN THE GENERAL ELECTIONS IF OF COURSE THEY COULD GET REGISTERED GIVEN ALL THE BARRIERS TO REGISTRATION
I'M TALKING ABOUT INEQUALITY WE HAVE AS CITIZENS
HE SAID IT COULD BE A HIGH SPADE OR A LOW SPADE
MY ANSWER WAS
AND MY ANSWER WAS
WHAT IS THE SECOND NUMBER
I HAVE A PLAYING CARD IN MY HAND
BUT IT WAS REALLY FAIR
IT WAS A SPADE
NOT ONLY THAT IF INSTEAD OF USING MY HAND WITH THE FINGERS I USE MY HAND CLOSED INTO A FIST THAT MAKES THIS
THINGS CAN ALWAYS CHANGE
THE 10 OF HEARTS
AND I BEGAN TO DAYDREAM
SO BACK TO THE TRAINING
THERE ARE ESSENTIALLY TWO WAYS IN WHICH YOU CAN GIVE GREATER WEIGHT TO THE INTERESTS THAT
MAY WE CONTINUE TO HONOR THAT PRINCIPLE
IT MAY INTERFERE WITH THOSE LEGITIMATE INTERESTS THAT GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE CHARGED WITH
ONE IS TO DEFINE OUT OR TO CARVE OUT EXCEPTIONS FOR TYPES OF SPEECH THAT
WE MUST PROTECT THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH OF THOSE WHO WOULD DENY THE VERY
WE MUST PROTECT THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH OF THOSE WHO WOULD REJECT THE VERY CONCEPT
BUT THE QUESTION REMAINS
WORDS CAN CAUSE PLENTY OF HARM
ARE WE JUSTIFIED IN DOING SO
FINALLY IT IS RECOGNIZED THAT SPEECH IS ESSENTIAL TO INDIVIDUAL AUTONOMY AND SELF
PRAISE YOUR RESURRECTION
PRAISE YOUR MOUTH
AND WHAT FAITH FELT LIKE
PRAISE THE BECOMING
ANYONE HERE WHO HAS DONATED THEIR TIME OR THEIR ENERGY TO A GOOD CAUSE REMEMBERS HOW WONDERFUL IT FELT TO BE A
IMAGINE WALKING DOWN REN L VESQUE BOULEVARD AND SEEING HOMELESS MEN HUDDLED TOGETHER TRYING TO STAY WARM IN THE
POVERTY HUNGER AND HOMELESSNESS NOT ONLY EXIST IN ETHIOPIA OR KENYA BUT YOU
LITTLE DID I KNOW THAT AT 9 YEARS OLD A COMMON EAR INFECTION WOULD CHANGE MY WHOLE PERSPECTIVE ON LIFE
THINK ABOUT IT
SO IF YOU APPLY A ONE AND A HALF PERCENT SLOWDOWN CONVERSION TO EVERY MAN WHO RAN HIS SUB FOUR MILE ON A SYNTHETIC
OUR PRIMATE COUSINS CAN'T DO THAT
AND THIS SHOWED IN ATHLETES' BODIES
BIOMECHANICAL ANALYSIS OF THE SPEED OF OWENS' JOINTS SHOWS THAT HAD BEEN RUNNING ON THE SAME SURFACE AS BOLT
AND THAT GUY WHO WON THE 1904 OLYMPIC MARATHON IN THREE IN A HALF HOURS THAT GUY WAS DRINKING RAT POISON AND
BUT NORMALLY WE CAN'T ACCESS NEARLY ALL OF IT
IN FACT IF YOU PLOT ON A HEIGHT VERSUS MASS GRAPH ONE DATA POINT FOR EACH OF TWO DOZEN SPORTS IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE 20TH
WHAT'S HAPPENING WHEN THAT HAPPENS IS THAT THE ELECTRICAL IMPULSE IS CAUSING ALL THEIR MUSCLE FIBERS TO TWITCH AT ONCE AND THEY'RE THROWING
ON RARE OCCASIONS A HIGH SCHOOL KID DOES IT
THE GUN GOES OFF
AN AMERICAN SPRINTER JUMPS OUT TO THE FRONT
RATHER THAN BLOCKS JESSE OWENS HAD A GARDENING TROWEL THAT HE HAD TO USE TO DIG HOLES IN THE CINDERS TO START FROM
THIS IS GIVEN TO PATIENTS WHO HAVE DIARRHEA LIKE JOHN
SO I DID AN EXPERIMENT IN THE LAB
THEN HE OR SHE AT THAT POINT THEY BOTH TOLD ME THAT THIS IS THE CURRENT STATE WHERE MANY BUGS THAT WE
AND BEFORE WE LEAVE THIS ROOM WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE JOHN GETS BETTER
THE TECHNOLOGY I USED TO UNDERSTAND THAT IS CALLED METABOLOMICS
IN THE END WE DECIDED THAT THE WATER HYACINTH WAS THE ACTUAL ICON THAT MADE THE MOST SENSE BECAUSE IT WAS THE
WE NEED TO LOOK AT MANY OF US AS THE EXPERT
AND THEY ARE ACTUALLY PROPOSING A SOCIAL ENTERPRISE THAT WOULD HELP CREATE JOBS AND REDUCE BIKE
HE ACTUALLY BELIEVED YOU HAD TO INGEST IT THROUGH YOUR MOUTH AND IN 1854 WHEN CHOLERA BROKE
AND IN THIS CASE IT CHANGED THE WORLD
BUT I ALSO LOVE DR
BECAUSE IF YOU BELIEVE PAVLOV AND ALL THE BEHAVIORIST WHO FOLLOWED HIM IT REALLY SHOULDN'T MATTER
IT'S KIND OF IN THIS AREA THAT I BECAME VERY INTERESTED IN INTRIGUED WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR DECADES
HOW DO WE DO IT WITH A DOG
WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE FATE OF THE UNIVERSE
AND THAT MEANS LOOK FAR AWAY
I THOUGHT IT SOUNDS GOOD
BECAUSE WHY NOT
I'LL DO THE REALITY CHECK THERE
SHARE YOUR KNOWLEDGE
WE'VE GOT AN INSURANCE FOR OUR CAR OF COURSE WE'VE GOT AN INSURANCE FOR OUR HEALTH SYSTEM THEN WE'VE GOT AN
PASSION WILL PUSH YOU MUCH FURTHER WHERE OTHERS HAVE ALREADY LOST THEIR INTEREST LONG AGO AND STOPPED WORKING
I'LL TRY THAT
BUT WHY NOT
OH ON FRIDAYS I NORMALLY DON'T WORK I ALWAYS PARTY THEN THE UGLY TRUTH IS IT'S
NO NO NO NO
AND I CAN TELL YOU ONE THING
IF YOU WANT TO SEE SOMETHING GROW NEVER KEEP WHAT YOU KNOW
AND HE SAID WELL BECAUSE WE'RE BANKRUPT
IT WILL SLOW YOU DOWN AND AT THE END OF THE DAY IT WILL BLOCK YOU IN ANYTHING YOU'LL DO BECAUSE YOU'LL BE FULL OF
NUMBER ONE IS DO YOUR HOMEWORK
SO IF YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO COME UP AND SAY I DIDN'T HAVE TIME IT'S A SUNNY DAY
I WENT THERE OK IT WAS MY DUTY AS WELL BUT I SHARED ALL THE INFORMATION I HAD ABOUT PR
I WANT TO HAVE MY MONEY BACK
EVERYTHING THAT I WAS LIVING IN EVERYTHING THAT SURROUNDED ME WAS BASED ON A REGULAR
AND THEN I REALIZED I DON'T WANT TO DO THE 9 TO 5 JOB THING ANYMORE
I JUST WANT TO GET RID OF ALL THIS SYSTEM WE HAVE WHICH SURROUNDED US
I SHARED ALL THE INFORMATION I HAD
WE'VE GONE FROM JOHN BEAT MARY TO MARY WAS BEATEN BY JOHN
PERPETRATORS ARE MUCH MORE NORMAL THAN THAT AND EVERYDAY THAN THAT
HOW DO WE SPEAK UP
WE DON'T LIKE IT WHEN PEOPLE CHALLENGE OUR POWER
WHY DO THEY KEEP GOING BACK
BUT WE ALSO OWE IT TO OUR SONS
NOW WHEN IT COMES TO MEN AND MALE CULTURE THE GOAL IS TO GET MEN WHO ARE NOT ABUSIVE TO CHALLENGE MEN WHO ARE
I KNOW WE CAN DO IT WE CAN DO BETTER
HOW CAN WE CHANGE THE SOCIALIZATION OF BOYS AND THE DEFINITIONS OF MANHOOD THAT LEAD TO THESE CURRENT OUTCOMES
BY THE WAY WE OWE IT TO WOMEN
AND IF WE CAN GET TO THE PLACE WHERE MEN WHO ACT OUT IN SEXIST WAYS WILL LOSE STATUS YOUNG MEN AND BOYS WHO
SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT BOTH WOMEN AND MEN HAVE IN COMMON
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE REALLY
THAT'S A GOOD ENGLISH SENTENCE
MOST MALE VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE ARE THE VICTIMS OF OTHER MEN'S VIOLENCE
WE'RE NOT EVEN THINKING ABOUT JOHN IT'S TOTALLY FOCUSED ON MARY
WHAT ARE THE ROLES OF VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS IN HELPING TO PRODUCE ABUSIVE MEN
THAT'S A VERY NAIVE NOTION RIGHT
BUT HOW DO WE NOT REMAIN SILENT IN THE FACE OF ABUSE
WE HEAR ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT
HOW DOES ALL THIS WORK
WHAT ABOUT ALL THOSE BOYS
HOW DO WE SUPPORT OUR FRIENDS
BUT ON A BIG SCALE WE NEED MORE ADULT MEN WITH POWER TO START PRIORITIZING THESE ISSUES
AND IF WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT MALE VICTIMS LET'S TALK ABOUT MALE VICTIMS
WE'LL SEE A RADICAL DIMINUTION OF THE ABUSE
AND THERE ARE WOMEN WHO ARE PERPETRATORS AND OF COURSE THERE ARE MEN WHO ARE VICTIMS
JUST LIKE WITH HETEROSEXISM IF YOU'RE A HETEROSEXUAL PERSON AND YOU YOURSELF DON'T ENACT HARASSING OR ABUSIVE BEHAVIORS TOWARDS
THERE'S A WHOLE SPECTRUM
SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE IN OUR SOCIETY AND IN THE WORLD
BUT WHEN YOU GET INTO IT YOU REALIZE THERE ARE PRESSURES ON MEN
OTHER PEOPLE WILL SAY WELL GET OFF IT
WHY WAS SHE DRINKING WITH THOSE GUYS IN THAT HOTEL ROOM
WHY IS THAT A COMMON PROBLEM IN OUR SOCIETY AND ALL OVER THE WORLD TODAY
WE ALSO OWE IT TO YOUNG MEN WHO ARE GROWING UP ALL OVER THE WORLD IN SITUATIONS WHERE THEY DIDN'T MAKE THE CHOICE TO BE A
HOW DO WE CHALLENGE OUR FRIENDS
YOU KNOW WHAT
WE ARE BOTH VICTIMS OF MEN'S VIOLENCE
BECAUSE THE TYPICAL PERPETRATOR IS NOT SICK AND TWISTED
I DON'T SEE THESE AS WOMEN'S ISSUES THAT SOME GOOD MEN HELP OUT WITH
THERE'S SOME CONFUSION ABOUT THE TERM GENDER
AND LET ME ILLUSTRATE THAT CONFUSION BY WAY OF ANALOGY
THERE'S BEEN AN AWFUL LOT OF SILENCE IN MALE CULTURE ABOUT THIS ONGOING TRAGEDY OF MEN'S VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND CHILDREN
WE KNOW ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT WE CAN EASILY DO THAT
WHAT DO WE DO
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WHEN THEY HEAR THE WORD GENDER THINK IT MEANS WOMEN
I'M USING THE GENDER BINARY
AND SOME PEOPLE WILL SAY HE NEEDS SENSITIVITY TRAINING
WHAT ABOUT ALL THE YOUNG MEN AND BOYS WHO HAVE BEEN TRAUMATIZED BY ADULT MEN'S VIOLENCE
STEP ONE DISCOVERED TRUTH
YOU GO OUT AND START CHANGING THOSE THINGS
HOW SKINNY WE ARE
WHAT'S STEP THREE
THE LAST STEP IS MAYBE THE MOST CRITICAL OF ALL
SEE WE GET THE PRINCIPAL OF CHANGE BACKWARDS BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT DIALED INTO YOUR POTENTIAL TO WHO YOU ARE GOOD
IT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE OVERNIGHT
IT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS OF TRYING TO OVERCOME THINGS
HOW SMART WE ARE
ONE DAY I REFUSED TO LET HER DO THAT TO ME
WHO'S DEFINING WHO YOU ARE AND HOW DO WE DEFINE OURSELVES
THE GIRLFRIEND BOYFRIEND WE HAVE
MY FATHER WAS A SAN FRANCISCAN
WE WERE TO BE ROUNDED UP AND IMPRISONED IN TEN BARBED WIRE PRISON CAMPS
MY MOTHER WAS BORN IN SACRAMENTO CALIFORNIA
SO WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IN THE DIGITAL AGE IS THAT WE CAN QUANTIFY VALUE IN LOTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS AND DO IT MORE EASILY
SO THAT'S A SORT OF STARBUCKS CURRENCY STAYING WITHIN ITS ECOSYSTEM
IS TECHNOLOGY MAKING PAPER MONEY FEEL OUTMODED
AND IT'S CURRENTLY AROUND THAT KIND OF 110 DOLLAR MARK IN VALUE
YOU THINK ABOUT REWARDS SCHEMES AIR MILES
YOU'VE BOUGHT INTO IT
THEY SAY THAT IS TRUST
WHEN THEY SPOT TIDE THERE'S A SHORTCUT
THEY'RE NOT ADVERTISING LOUD MESSAGES AT YOU AND THAT'S WHERE ADVERTISING HAS STARTED TO SHIFT NOW IS INTO THINGS LIKE SERVICES TOOLS
ARE WE DECOUPLING MONEY FROM THE GOVERNMENT
YOU CAN'T BUY STUFF WITH PESOS
SO THAT BRINGS ME BACK TO THE CONNECTION WITH SWEAT
IT'S 50 PERCENT ABOVE THE CATEGORY AVERAGE
IT'S INFUSED WITH A VERY COMPLEX COCKTAIL OF CHEMICALS SO IT SMELLS VERY LUXURIOUS AND VERY DISTINCTIVE AND
THIS IS PURELY FOR THE COMMUNITY THAT ARE SWEATING USING NIKE PRODUCTS
AND THAT'S NOT SURPRISING IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE BASKET CASE THAT IS THE E
NO ONE KNOWS WHO OR WHAT HE IS
HE'S ALMOST LIKE THE BANKSY OF THE INTERNET
SO IN ONE LEVEL IT WENT FROM SOMETHING LIKE 13 DOLLARS TO 266 LITERALLY IN THE SPACE OF FOUR MONTHS AND THEN CRASHED AND
AND YOU CAN'T COME INTO THIS
AS A LOVER OF HUMAN ANATOMY I'M SO EXCITED THAT WE'RE FINALLY PUTTING OUR BODIES AT THE CENTER OF FOCUS
THAT BEGS THE QUESTION WHAT IF THE ALGORITHMS ARE WRONG
WE TALKED ABOUT IT
A REASONABLE CHOICE WOULD BE THE LAST 21 YEARS OF APPLICATIONS TO FOX NEWS
I LATER FOUND OUT THAT NOBODY IN NEW YORK CITY HAD ACCESS TO THAT FORMULA
THE DATA WHAT WOULD THE DATA BE
REMEMBER WITH THE HIRING ALGORITHM
SECOND WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT THE DEFINITION OF SUCCESS AUDIT THAT
SOMEONE WHO STAYS FOR FOUR YEARS AND IS PROMOTED ONCE
THEY AUTOMATE THE STATUS QUO
AND WE CAN FIX THEM
HE DECIDED TO PLOT THEM
MY OPINION MATTERS
I WAS DENIED
ONE IS LIFE WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE AND THE OTHER ONE IS LIFE WITH
SOMEBODY STOLE MY PHONE
THERE ARE MEN WHO I HAVE LEARNED FROM THERE ARE MEN I CONTINUE TO LEARN FROM AND
SO WE WON'T RECEIVE ANY MORE INFORMATION BACK FROM THEM
I WAS FASCINATED BY IT
NOW I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I FEEL SAD ABOUT THIS RATHER TRAGIC DIAGNOSIS OR SHOULD
PERHAPS YOUR DOMESTIC DOG FOR A WHILE BEFORE HOPEFULLY BECOMING FERAL
DON'T EVEN WORRY ABOUT YOUR CAT
WILLIAM ANDERS WAS THE FIRST TO WITNESS THE EVENT
I'M AFRAID HOPE IS NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH
IT DID NOT TAKE US LONG TO REALIZE THAT OUR JOURNEY HAD JUST AS MUCH TO DO WITH CONCERNS OVER THE
I THOUGHT I HAD SEEN THE WORLD DISH OUT SOME PRETTY NASTY STUFF TO ANIMALS AT THAT POINT BUT IT PALED IN
CAMP KATRINA WAS RUN BY THE HUMANE SOCIETY OF LOUISIANA AND IT WAS BASICALLY A HASTILY
SOMETIMES IN VERY SURPRISING WAYS
I WAS BROUGHT UP IN A FAMILY OF PSYCHOLOGISTS
AND YOUR HEALTH IS INCREDIBLY DEPENDENT UPON THE LIFE AND VIBRANCY OF THIS RAINFOREST
FIVE MILLION PEOPLE USE IT EVERY MONTH
NOW THIS SOUNDS CRAZY RIGHT
SO THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO STUDY WHEN I WAS A GRADUATE STUDENT
BUT IT IS NOT BY ANY MEANS AN OPTIMAL SITUATION
AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT THIS IS A TRANSFORMATIVE EXPERIENCE
NOW I KNOW YOU'RE ASKING HOW ARE WE GOING TO SOLVE REAL WORLD PROBLEMS IN GAMES
AND SO RECENTLY SCIENTISTS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT HERODOTUS' CRAZY STORY IS ACTUALLY TRUE
OKAY WE CAN DO THAT
THEY NEVER GIVE YOU A CHALLENGE YOU CAN'T ACHIEVE
THAT'S AN EPIC WIN
THIS IS A GAMER ON THE VERGE OF AN EPIC WIN
WE DO ACHIEVE MORE IN GAME WORLDS
I DON'T HAVE THE SOLUTION TO BREAKING DOWN THE STIGMA BUT I DO NEED TO STRESS HOW IMPORTANT IT IS
DEPRESSION IS LIKE A PARASITE
WE NEED TO BE CONSCIOUS OF IT
WE NEED TO BE AWARE
WE NEED TO HELP THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE SUFFERING
YOU'RE ENTITLED TO THAT TOO
A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THIS IS HOUSING
I KNOW THIS IN PART BECAUSE THIS IS MY STORY
AND YOU MIGHT THINK I'M TALKING ABOUT TORONTO
HERE'S WHAT I WOULD DISTINGUISH
SIX YEARS SO WE KNOW WE HAVE TO BE MORE EDUCATED AND WE KNOW WE HAVE TO CHANGE HOW WE'RE DOING IN COLORADO TO
WE'VE BEEN TEACHING KIDS FOR 50 TO 60 YEARS ABOUT EXACTLY THE SAME WAY AND WE KNOW IT'S NOT WORKING VERY WELL
WE FRAME A POWER LUNCH AS WHO'S WITH YOU AND WHAT I'D SAY TO EACH OF YOU IS I THINK THERE'S A
NOT GOING FOR THE THING YOU REALLY WANT BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID YOU MAY NOT GET IT
EVERYBODY DOESN'T NEED A FOUR YEAR DEGREE BUT YOU'VE GOT TO GET YOURSELF TO COLLEGE
I THINK HUGE EMPHASIS ON EDUCATION
THIS DOESN'T MEAN EVERYBODY NEEDS A MASTER'S WHAT THIS MEANS IS WE KNOW THAT IN SIX SHORT
RIGHT NOW 48 OF OUR POPULATION MEETS THOSE REQUIREMENTS
WE NEED TO GO DEEPER
YOU'RE PROBABLY ASKING WILL MY BRAIN HELP
IF YOU THINK OF THEM AT A HIGH LEVEL OF ACTIVATION IN GREEN AND AT A LOW LEVEL OF ACTIVATION IN RED
I CAME INTO THIS THINKING OH MY GOD
IT'S THE GROWTH TRAJECTORY OF THE BRAIN IT'S THE CHANGES THAT ARE HAPPENING ACROSS
THIS INFORMATION IS NECESSARY FOR US TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS CAUSING THE DISORDER
I AM AN ORGAN DONOR
YOU THINK NOTHING OF CHECKING THAT BOX AT THE DMV TO SAY
WHEN I TALK TO PEOPLE ABOUT IT THE BLANK LOOK THEY GET ON THEIR FACE WHEN THEY ASK ME WHAT DO YOU DO
I CAN'T IMAGE ANYTHING WORSE
HIS NAME WAS GREYSON
THE ANSWER IS YES
IT IS NOT A MONEY ISSUE A PERSONNEL OR LACK OF KNOW HOW
THAT IS THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING TO MAKE PROGRESS
WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH
WHAT DOES THAT TELL US
THIS IS WHY YOU NEED TO CARE
WHAT IS AUTISM
SO HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET THERE
WE DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT
THE OTHERS ARE
OR DO YOU KEEP GOING
I WAS SO EXCITED TO GO
THEY ARE HOUSED IN THESE INTELLECTUAL SPACES AND IN THESE INCREDIBLE ARCHITECTURAL BUILDINGS
BUT THE SOCIAL PART OF NOT BEING WITH ANYBODY IS NOT SOMETHING PEOPLE WANT TO OVERCOME
AND IT BASICALLY SAID THAT PARTICIPATION IN THE ARTS IS DOWN DRAMATICALLY OVER THE LAST
THEY ARE DOWNLOADING PODCASTS
AND I'VE THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT THE REASONS THAT PEOPLE LOVE TO GO TO ART MUSEUMS
THEY REPRESENT EXPERIENCES THAT MOST OF US CAN ONLY DREAM OF
AND WHAT'S UP IS TECHNOLOGY
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SAID THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY AREN'T GOING TO THESE KINDS OF CULTURAL THINGS THEY WOULD OTHERWISE LIKE
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND WE KIND OF KNOW WHY
PEOPLE ARE INTERFACING WITH TECHNOLOGY
THEY ARE PULLING UP GOOGLE ART
AND I KNOW YOU'RE PROBABLY SITTING THERE THINKING DANA YOU JUST TOLD ME THAT PEOPLE AREN'T GOING TO ART MUSEUMS SO WHAT'S UP
AND ON ONE HAND THAT'S REALLY DISTRESSING
IS IT THE PEOPLE THAT YOU WERE WITH
THE NEA STUDY THAT I INITIALLY TOLD YOU ABOUT ACTUALLY SAID THAT THE MAIN REASON PEOPLE GO TO
AND I'M REALLY INTERESTED TO SEE WHAT WILL HAPPEN WITH ART MUSEUMS IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY
BUT FOR NOW OPEN YOUR EYES
AND I REMEMBER HIS SOFT SKIN AND HIS HAIR AND HIS RED CLOAK
AND NOW I'VE SPENT TWENTY YEARS WORKING IN ART MUSEUMS CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE TO ENGAGE WITH ONE
AND THEY ARE ENGAGING WITH CULTURE IN A WAY THAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE TO THEM IN TERMS OF TIME IN TERMS OF SPACE IN TERMS OF
AND I'M LIKE THANK YOU MAN YOU MADE THE ASK
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO QUIT YOUR JOB TOMORROW
WE WENT OUT TO DINNER AND I SAID WHAT'S GOING ON MAN
HE'S LIKE MY FRIENDS ARE STARTING A STARTUP IN PALO ALTO THERE'S THREE OF THEM THEY DON'T REALLY KNOW
THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT MAKING THE WORLD MORE INNOVATIVE COMPASSIONATE AND SUSTAINABLE
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
SHE WAS WORKING AS THE MARKETING DIRECTOR FOR A JEWELRY COMPANY IN SAN FRANCISCO
AND A COUPLE OF TIMES SHE SORT OF GREETS
I REMEMBER THEM
IT COULD BE A DRESS
ALWAYS WITH A SMILE
I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT AGAIN
I'VE DONE THIS
AND I AM OLD
AND I'M TRYING TO TELL THEM GUYS
BUT IT'S ALWAYS LIGHT BLUE
HE COULD REST
IT COULD BE A SUIT
IT COULD BE A GOWN
AND WE LEARNED THROUGH THEM
THEY JUST GOT TOGETHER
WE WERE A JOKE
JUST ENOUGH TO GET RID OF INFLATION THEN EVERYTHING WOULD BE GOOD AGAIN
WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY ALLOWS A SITUATION TO GET SO HARD THAT CANNOT GET ITS ACT TOGETHER
AND THERE ARE SOME HOSPITALS THAT WOULD DO ANGIOGRAMS TO JUST MAKE SURE IT'S OK SO MANY
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY WE HELP THOSE PATIENTS WITH MILD OR MODERATE DISEASES TO RECOGNISE THAT
IS THE CHOLESTEROL TOO HIGH
AND THAT'S WHY WE ARE DOING BLOOD TESTS WE ARE DOING EKGS TO DETECT ANY ELECTRICAL
IS THE BLOOD SUGAR TOO HIGH
CAN WE OFFER THIS SERVICE TO ANOTHER HOSPITAL THAT DOES NOT HAVE THE
WELL WE ASK A VERY SIMPLE QUESTION
WE NEED TO SHARE THIS BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION
ALL OF THESE THINGS NEED TO CHANGE ONCE YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAVE EARLY SIGNS OF PLAQUE BUILD UP
SO YOU WANT TO DISRUPT WHATEVER PEOPLE FEEL COMFORTABLE DOING BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT THING IT'S
TO ME THAT'S LIKE PLAYING RUSSIAN ROULETTE
HOW CAN YOU DISTINGUISH ONE FROM ANOTHER
HOW DO YOU KNOW FOR WHICH ONE YOU NEED TO GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND FOR WHICH ONE YOU DON'T
YOU CAN'T WE AREN'T DONE YET
THERE IS ONE PATHOLOGIST FOR EVERY CASE
WE HAVE A TEAM
HIGH FIVE DADDY
HE IMMEDIATELY FELL IN LOVE WITH HIS REFLECTION AND FROZE
AND MY WIFE SAID I DON'T HAVE A SPECIAL TALENT
AND THIS IS RELATIVELY RARE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ONE OR TWO PERCENT OF THE POPULATION AT ANY ONE TIME
HE DIED THERE
I SAID YEAH I DON'T KNOW
SOMETIMES WE TALK ABOUT THEM AS SHY NARCISSISTS BECAUSE THEY ARE SHY SOMETIMES AS BASEMENT NARCISSISTS AS
AND THE IDEA WAS WRITE YOUR SPECIAL TALENT
YOU WANT TO HEAR ABOUT HOW AWESOME I AM
SHE IS A GENIUS
THEY TEND TO BE MORE ACTIVE
PEOPLE WHO ARE NARCISSISTIC HAVE MORE FRIENDS OR FOLLOWERS OR LINKS IN SOCIAL MEDIA
SO IN THE OLD DAYS IF YOU WANTED TO DO THE KYLIE JENNER REALITY SHOW YOU
SHE JUST GOT ON HER PHONE FILMED HERSELF SENT IT RIGHT TO HER FANS WHICH IS JUST AMAZING IT'S AN AMAZING
THE TERM NARCISSISM OR SELF LOVE CAME TO PSYCHOLOGY IN A COUPLE WAYS
AND THEN I THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND I THOUGHT OH MY GOD
EVENTUALLY NARCISSUS STUMBLED AND SAW HIMSELF IN A POOL OF WATER
IT SORT OF WORKS
AND IN THIS PLACE A FLOWER GREW A DAYLILY WHICH TODAY WE CALL THE NARCISSUS
I DON'T HAVE A SPECIAL TALENT
IT WAS FIRST USED BY SOMEBODY NAMED HAVELOCK ELLIS WHO WAS A BRITISH SEXOLOGIST WHO TALKED ABOUT SELF LOVE IN A
THE SECOND FORM OF NARCISSISM WHICH MOST OF YOU PROBABLY DON'T THINK OF UNLESS YOU ARE IN THE CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY
SO WE TALK ABOUT THESE SOMETIMES AS COVERT NARCISSISTS BECAUSE THEY ARE HARD TO SPOT YOU DON'T REALLY SEE THEM OUT THERE
AND IN FACT I MEAN THE BEST WAY I THINK ABOUT EGO IS IT'S A TOOL IN YOUR TOOL BOX
BUT OTHERS HAVE USED THIS TO REALLY POSITIVE ENDS
SO THAT EXACT SAME THING YOU SAID THAT'S HOW I FEEL WHEN I WAS SPEAKING ENGLISH
THE PROBLEM AT HAND
BECAUSE THEY HAD THE ANSWER TO WHAT I LACKED
SALLY HUSTLES SEASHELLS ON THE BEACH
ASLAN IF YOU WANT TO BE SUCCESSFUL YOU HAVE TO GET OUT OF THE COMFORT ZONE
WELL I RAN THE MOST MILES I GOT THE PRIZE I GOT SOME RESPECT BUT THAT DIDN'T CHANGE MY SPEAKING
AND I THOUGHT SUBCONSCIOUSLY
IF I RUN THE MOST MILES I WILL GET THE PRIZE AND I WILL EARN THE RESPECT OF THESE KIDS THAT TEASE ME
THE WORDS I COULD SAY BUT MEANT THE SAME THING
SO FOR WORDS THAT MEANT THE SAME THING BUT ONLY HAD TWO SYLLABLES COMPARED TO A WORD THAT HAD THREE SYLLABLES I WOULD SAY THE WORD
WHO TALKED THE MOST
WITHOUT SKIPPING A BEAT EVERYONE THERE WOULD SAY MY NAME
WELL WE'RE NOT
SO IT'S BEEN TAKING A NUMBER OF DECADES TO GET WHERE THEY'RE AT
THAT'S HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE AROUND YOU
THERE'S A NUMBER OF SURVEYS WHO TRY TO FIGURE IT OUT
YOU CAN BE SEEN FROM THE SIDE
IT HAS DAYTIME RUNNING LIGHTS
IT'S ACTUALLY SHOCKINGLY SMALL
I'M GOING TO MAKE A BETTER HEADLIGHT
BUT I'M GOING TO DO IT BY MOVING THE LIGHT WHERE IT'S NEEDED
MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT
I SAID YEAH MY ROTOR IS NOT BENT
EITHER THAT OR I'M AS SMART AS I EVER WAS IT'S JUST NOW I'M CONSTANTLY BEING
I THINK WHAT'S THAT ABOUT
HE SAID I THINK YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT
THAT IS MY SEAT
WHEN I GOT TO CHARLOTTE SHE CALLED ME
YOU WERE AS WHITE AS A SHEET
SO I CAN GO ON VACATION OR I CAN GET MY HAIR CUT
WHEN MY OLDER BROTHER WAS IN FOURTH GRADE HE HAD A TERM PAPER ON BIRDS DUE THE
THE MOVEMENT OF GRACE IS WHAT CHANGES US HEALS US AND HEALS OUR WORLD
THEY JUST DO IT
I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
A GOOD NAME FOR GOD IS NOT ME
MY PASTOR SAID YOU CAN TRAP BEES ON THE BOTTOM OF MASON JARS WITHOUT LIDS BECAUSE THEY DON'T LOOK UP
THEY DO IT BY PREARRANGEMENT WITH THEMSELVES
NUMBER TWO ALMOST EVERYTHING WILL WORK AGAIN IF YOU UNPLUG IT FOR A FEW MINUTES
THIS IS THE MOST HORRIBLE TRUTH AND I SO RESENT IT
IT'S A HUGE GIFT TO THE WORLD
I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE NEED IT THINK ABOUT
LET'S BREAK IT DOWN
I NORMALLY FOCUS ON NUMBERS
AND TO BE HONEST I MEAN THIS IS A BUSINESS ICON A FORTUNE TEN CEO
THAT'S A GREAT PLACE TO BE
THE TRIPLE BOTTOM LINE
I WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD
INCREASINGLY FOR THE RIGHT REASONS I FOCUS WITH ORGANIZATIONS ON
YOU WANT TO MOVE UP IN BUSINESS
YOU SEE ALL THESE CHIEF TITLES THIS IS A REPRESENTATION OF THAT
AND I OFFER THIS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION
FOR TWENTY YEARS AND I'D DONE OKAY BUT I WAS WAITING ALWAYS FOR SOMEBODY ELSE TO TELL ME IS IT TIME FOR THAT NEXT I DIDN'T WANT TO
THAT'S A GREAT PLACE TO BE
I REMEMBER MELISSA'S PATIENCE WAITING HER TURN
I FOCUS ON NUMBERS
TO LOVE WHAT THEY'RE DOING
SO WE GET ON THE JET I BOARD THE JET WE HAVE A NICE DINNER
AND THAT LED TO A BUNCH OF OTHER THOUGHTS
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT SHE SERVED ME
BUT IT'S ABOUT NUMBERS
I KNOW I AM
AND THE REAL QUESTION IS
WE HAVE ALL OUR COMMUNICATION DEVICES RIGHT
I THINK THIS IS A REALLY GOOD THING
SHE WAS AN INSPIRATION
WE DON'T SHY AWAY FROM THE MORE TRADITIONAL METHODS LIKE DIRECT INSTRUCTION WHEN IT'S THE BEST WAY
WE WERE WRITING A PIECE WHERE WE WERE TRYING TO ILLUSTRATE THE CONSUMPTION WASTE
WE HAD SET DESIGNS
WE'D ACTUALLY DONE ALMOST NO THEATER
BUT WE KNEW WHAT WE WERE PASSIONATE ABOUT AND IT WAS A WHOLE SERIES OF THINGS THAT WE HAD NEVER SEEN
AT BLUE MAN GROUP ITERATION WAS ESSENTIAL FOR OUR CREATIVE PROCESS
I CALL IT MY INVESTMENT PROPERTY
HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE A WILL
PUT YOUR HAND UP
AND I AM PLEASED TO REPORT THAT INNOVATION HAS TOUCHED THE WORLD OF CORPSE DISPOSAL
I WAS A READER BEFORE I BECAME A WRITER
AND OFTEN LIFE'S TRUTHS CAN BE ESTABLISHED NOT BY REASON BUT BY IMAGINATION
AND WHY NOT
IT'S A MILD VERSION OF STAGE FRIGHT
THIS IS A BELLY BREATH
I'LL BE PERFECTLY HONEST WITH YOU
I DID WHAT ANY GOOD DAD WOULD DO
AND WE'VE TAKEN CARE OF IT BUT WE JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW SO YOU CAN HANDLE THINGS WHEN YOU GET HOME
I'LL FORGIVE THAT KID
BAD GUY YOU BULLIED MY KID AND MADE HER CRY
I'D BEEN TAUGHT BY ALL MY CHILDHOOD HEROES
HULK HOGAN THE A TEAM REMEMBER MR
YOU LEARN THAT THE BALLOONS ARE POSSIBLE BECAUSE THERE'S SOME MATERIAL THAT WILL WORK FOR THEM
IT'S GREAT TO HEAR FROM YOU AND A PLEASURE TO SIT AT THIS TABLE WITH YOU
GIVE ME A SENSE OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF YOUR OWN MIND
CR IT IS GREAT TO SEE YOU HERE
YOU HAVE THIS IDEA OF GOOGLE X
NOW THAT'S AN IMPORTANT CONCEPT
IT HAS TO DO WITH LANGUAGES
IT IS SECURITY AND PRIVACY
WELL WE GOT TO START SOMEWHERE WHAT IS THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE THING THAT WE COULD FOCUS ON
BECAUSE IN THE BEGINNING WE WERE ALL GETTING CRANKY WHEN WE WERE GETTING INTO ANALYSIS PARALYSIS MODE
I FIND THAT IN ORDER TO GET UNSTUCK I FIRST HAVE TO GET OUT OF MY HEAD
PAC MAN IS SAVING LIVES
LET'S GIVE UP
ALRIGHT SO WHAT DO WE KNOW
YOU CAN'T CONTROL YOUR WAY TO INNOVATION
AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS WE NEED TO FORGET OURSELVES AND WE NEED TO FOCUS ON LEARNING AS MUCH AS WE POSSIBLY CAN
AND THE REALITY IS IS YOUR EGO GETS ALL IN THE MIX
AND PEOPLE THAT ARE HAVING FUN THINK BETTER
BECAUSE YOU ALL ACKNOWLEDGED IN THE BEGINNING THAT YOU GET STUCK SOMETIMES
BUT THEN WHEN WE STARTED PLAYING AROUND AND TALKING TO EACH OTHER THE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES HELPED US TO MAKE
THEY BRING UP MICROCATHETERS SO THAT THERE'S SUPPORT AND THEY TRY TO NAVIGATE
I KNOW YOU'RE ALL EXCITED ABOUT THIS
AND HERE IS WHAT THOSE ARE
LET'S BE SLACKERS
WE WERE CHARGED WITH COMING UP WITH A SOLUTION THAT WAS GOING TO IMPROVE THIS PROCEDURE AS WELL AS IMPROVE
THAT SOLUTION MIGHT HAVE TAKEN THE FORM OF A PIECE OF IMAGING SOFTWARE OR IT MIGHT HAVE TAKEN THE FORM OF A MEDICAL
EVERY TIME YOU GET STRESSED OUT WE GET CLOSE TO A DEADLINE YOU WANT TO BAIL
AND TO GET UNSTUCK I REMEMBER THE REVERSE PAC MAN AND THE LESSONS I LEARNED FROM IT
YOU NEED THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF CARBON WHICH IS THE DEAD BROWN STUFF
THERE'S A MAJOR ISSUE IN THIS COUNTRY WITH WASTE AT THE SOURCE
WHEN YOU DO THAT YOU CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT FOR THESE MICROBES TO THRIVE
THIS MAKES SENSE
THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF OXYGEN AND THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF MOISTURE LIKE A WRUNG OUT SPONGE
THIS IS THEIR A HA
WE WERE DOING IT ALL BY HAND
WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT
I STARTED TO LOOK AT LITTLE THINGS AT THIS CAFE WE COULD DO TO LESSEN OUR IMPACT
NO YOU REALLY DON'T
YOU'RE AN ALCHEMIST
WE COMBINE IT WITH A CARBON SOURCE MAINLY LEAF WASTE
THEY SAY DO YOU ADD AN OUTSIDE HEATING ELEMENT
I WENT TO COMPOST SCHOOL
I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO WAIT AROUND TO GET A DAY PASS
AND I WAS THERE TO BE TELLING THE STORY
YOU I IMAGINE CAN DO MUCH BETTER THINGS WITH YOUR TIME
YOU WON'T LIVE FOREVER
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THIS IS A TERRIBLE THING EVEN THOUGH I UNDERSTAND PAIN
AN INFINITE NUMBER OF MONKEYS COULD NEVER WRITE THE WORKS OF SHAKESPEARE
THAT TO ME IS AN INCREDIBLE THING
THAT IS A WONDERFUL IDEA
WE ARE NOW A REGISTERED CHARITY IN THE US WE'RE TALKING TO FOUNDATIONS WE COULDN'T HAVE POSSIBLY GOT HOLD OFF BEFORE
SO ANYTHING THAT WE COLLECT IN 2016 WE'RE BRINGING DIRECTLY TO OUR PARTNERSHIPS IN THE RAINFOREST
WHAT'S GOING TO WORK BEST FOR YOUR COMMUNITIES
WE HAVE DISNEY NOW FUNDING SOME FANTASTIC BIODIVERSITY WORK
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THINGS THAT YOU DO BECAUSE OTHER CHARITIES DO THEM
WE STOPPED DOING CERTAIN THINGS TELLING OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS HOW TO SPEND THE MONEY WE GAVE
WE ALWAYS TRIED TO AVOID IT BUT WE REALLY STEPPED BACK AND SAID LOOK THIS IS YOUR CASH IT'S YOUR RAINFOREST
WE ALL KNOW THAT IMPERFECTION EXISTS ALL AROUND US
THINK ABOUT THAT
4 BILLION DOLLAR AIRCRAFT BECAUSE THE MAINTENANCE CREW ONLY DID 99 PERCENT OF THEIR JOB
STRESS IS BAD FOR US ISN'T IT
I GUARANTEE YOU IT WASN'T A 72 WAY TIE
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD BE MORE LIKE THE PROFESSIONAL ATHLETE OR WE SHOULD BE MORE LIKE THAT TIRELESS PROGRAMMER OR LIKE THAT
SOMEBODY HAD THE HIGHEST GPA
SEE TODAY WE'RE ALL SO AFRAID OF THAT WORD FAILURE BUT THE TRUTH IS WE NEED TO FAIL
WHEN DID WE COME TO LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE THESE TYPES OF TYPOS COMMON ERRORS THIS DO YOUR BEST ATTITUDE OR JUST GOOD ENOUGH WAS
WELL TYPOSQUATTING IS WHERE COMPANIES LIKE GOOGLE POST ADVERTISEMENTS ON WEBSITES THAT ARE COMMONLY MISKEYED
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
THE GOLD OF TODAY IS MOBILE AND MOBILE IS THE ENABLER THAT MAKES ALL OF THIS POSSIBLE
AND IF YOU CAN DO THAT YOU CAN RISE OUT OF POVERTY
BECAUSE WE HAVE REAL PROBLEMS
SO WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO WITH IT
THIS IS INNOVATION OVER THE EDGE
WE HAVE REALLY SEVERE ENERGY PROBLEMS IN AFRICA
IN 1963 A STORM RIPPED UP THE HARBOR IN A SMALL SOUTH AFRICAN TOWN CALLED
NOW THIS IS REAL INNOVATION NOT THE WAY PEOPLE HAVE EXPROPRIATED THE WORD TO TALK ABOUT LAUNCHING
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO
HOW DO YOU DO THAT
ONE IN THREE AMERICAN CHILDREN IS ON TRACK TO DEVELOP TYPE 2 DIABETES ONE IN TWO OF OUR CHILDREN OF COLOR
THEY HAVE ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH IN WASHINGTON AS IT IS
WE NEED TO IDENTIFY THOSE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE MOST EFFECTIVE ON THE GROUND AND GIVE THEM BOOTS
THE PROBLEM IS OF COURSE THERE AREN'T ENOUGH WOMEN IN NEWSROOMS
PUTTING THEM THERE MADE THEM MORE RECOGNIZABLE
A RECENT GLOBAL SURVEY FOUND THAT 73 PERCENT OF THE TOP MEDIA MANAGEMENT JOBS ARE STILL HELD BY MEN
IT WAS A LOT OF FANTASY A LOT OF MY DESIRES
HE'S A VERY MACHO GUY
AND I STARTED WRITING ABOUT MY FAMILY AS A WAY TO GET BACK TO MY FAMILY
IT MAY HAVE BEEN OBVIOUS BUT I HADN'T COME OUT YET TO MY FAMILY
WHEN I GOT OUT I TOOK AN OVERDOSE
DID YOU READ IT
I LOOK AT MY BROTHER
EVENTUALLY I GOT OUT
AND PEOPLE ASK ME WAS THIS A CATHARTIC EXPERIENCE WRITING THIS NOVEL
I HAD TO UNDERSTAND THAT MY PARENTS LOVED ME
I FELT BETRAYED BY MY FAMILY
DID YOU READ IT
I HAD TO VISIT THE TRAUMA AGAIN I HAD TO GO BACK AND THINK ABOUT MY
IT WAS KIND OF THE BABY STEPS OF A FICTION WRITER
MY MOTHER'S THERE MY BROTHER'S THERE
I GREW UP IN A SMALL TOWN
I'M 14 I'M BECOMING A JUGGLER
UPON ARRIVING AT EACH BAR AN OLDER STUDENT WOULD SHOUT OUT A WORD WHICH WAS CODE FOR US TO EITHER FLASH
THERE WAS ALSO A LOT OF EVIDENCE IN WHAT WE WERE HEARING TO SUGGEST THAT THIS KIND OF SEXUAL OBJECTIFICATION CARRIED OVER
WE CAN SPEAK UP ABOUT CONSENT AND TRY TO OFFSET SOME OF THESE NORMALIZED ASSUMPTIONS
OUR GROUP BUMPED INTO THE MEN'S RUGBY CLUB IN A BAR
AT ANOTHER IT WAS CALLED SHARKING AT ANOTHER IT WAS SIMPLY CALLED FUCK A FRESHER
DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S SOMEONE YOU KNOW IF IT'S LATE OR IF YOU'RE DRUNK
IT FELT LIKE FANCY DRESS FOR THE BOYS MEANT SOMETHING FUN MEANT DRESSING UP IN A WHOLE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT WAYS
NO MEANS NO
THE WHOLE THING CULMINATED IN THE GIRLS AND GUYS MEETING UP IN THE STUDENT UNION WHERE WE WERE INFORMED THE OLDER STUDENTS HAD ORGANIZED A
WE'RE HAVING A BIT OF HARMLESS BANTER
A LONG LINE OF GIRLS WAS LINED UP AND THEY HAD TO TAKE THEIR CLOTHES OFF THEY WERE TOLD TO RACE TO STRIP
I DIDN'T REALIZE WHAT WE WERE GOING TO DO AS WE WERE FACING THE OTHER WAY WHEN THEY SUDDENLY SHOUTED DOWN IT BITCH
I'M AFRAID THESE ATTITUDES THAT WE THOUGHT WERE EBBING AWAY ARE COMING BACK WITH FORCE
HE WAS CALLING ME A SLAG A SLUT AND A WHORE
WE HAVE TO START NOW
SO WHY DOES ALL THIS MATTER
IT RUINED MY FRESHERS WEEK AND LEFT ME FEELING ISOLATED AND HUMILIATED
WAS I DRESSED SLUTTILY
SO WHAT CAN YOU DO TO PLAY YOUR PART
WE HAD TO COME UP WITH A SLUT NAME WHICH THE OLDER STUDENTS ENCOURAGED US TO WRITE ACROSS OUR BREASTS
WITH ONE EMAIL
BUT WHY SHOULD IT BE A REQUIREMENT
SO WE HAVE TO SPEAK UP AND OUR VOICES ARE LOUDEST WHEN WE RAISE THEM TOGETHER
I HAD SOME GREAT SUPPORT FROM MY FAMILY AND SOME GREAT THERAPY
I WASN'T LIKE WOODY ALLEN WHO ONCE SAID
IN ONE MONTH WE COMPLETED NINE CLASSROOMS OVER 500 SQUARE METERS
AFTER A FIRE WHAT ARE YOU PROPOSING
IT'S STILL USED EVEN AFTER THE CURRENT EARTHQUAKE IN CHINA
SO I REMEMBER IT WAS SO DISAPPOINTING
THEY HAVE MONEY AND POWER
SO MUCH WATER TO GLIDE THROUGH
BUT JUST BECAUSE I END THE POEM DOESN'T MEAN THAT I'VE SOLVED WHATEVER I WAS PUZZLING THROUGH
IT WAS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
BUT THEY KEPT THE LOFT AT WOOSTER STREET FOR BIRTHDAY PARTIES AND TREASURE HUNTS
OPENS HIS EYES AT ONCE
MOVED TO A HOUSE NEAR A PARK
I DON'T MEAN THIS METAPHORICALLY
AND WHAT IT WAS I WAS TRYING TO NAVIGATE AND THE WORDS THAT I CHOSE TO HELP ME
AND I USE POETRY IN MY LIFE AS A WAY TO HELP ME NAVIGATE AND WORK THROUGH THINGS
BUT AT THE END OF THE MONTH I LOOKED BACK AT THESE 30 POEMS I HAD WRITTEN AND DISCOVERED THAT THEY WERE ALL TRYING
IT WASN'T ALWAYS EASY
HE SHOWED UP AT WORLD WAR II WITH A SMIRK AND A HOBBY
THEY GOT MARRIED
TINY DOTS OF LIGHT BLINKING OUT OF HIM FROM OUT OF THE DARKEST DARKS
A YEAR LATER HE TRAVELED ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO FOLLOW A FOREST FIRE STAYED FOR A WEEK HUNTING IT WITH HIS
I LIKE TO REVISIT OLD POETRY BECAUSE IT SHOWS ME EXACTLY WHERE I WAS AT THAT MOMENT
I BUSIED MYSELF TELLING STORIES AND SHARING STORIES AND COLLECTING THEM
AND LAST YEAR I TRIED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME AND I WAS THRILLED BY THE EFFICIENCY AT WHICH I WAS ABLE TO PRODUCE
AND THE ONLY TWO ROOMS IN THE HOUSE WITH WALLS THAT REACHED ALL THE WAY UP TO THE CEILING AND DOORS THAT OPENED AND CLOSED WERE THE
THEY NAMED HIM SWEET POTATO
HE THINKS THAT SCUBA DIVERS MUST HAVE THE MOST WONDERFUL JOB IN THE WORLD
THEY ARE TOO BUSY RECALCULATING WHAT THIS ALL MEAN FOR LOST TIME
HIS FINGERS FIND THE PILLOWCASE'S SAILING MASTS
WE HAVE BOTH LEARNED THE ART OF CAPTURE
HE TURNS ON HIS SIDE
HIS FIRST TIME OUT HE FOLLOWED THE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS DOTTING THEIR WAY THROUGH NEW YORK CITY'S TREES
BEFORE SHE WAS WIFE SHE WAS ARTIST
BUT WHAT FASCINATED ME MORE IS THAT MADDIE'S CURIOSITY TOOK HER TO A NEW LEVEL
AS IF WHAT WE ARE DOING ONE DAY WILL SAVE LIVES
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WE NEED ACTION IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR WE NEED FRAMEWORKS IN PUBLIC POLICY WE NEED AWARENESS AND INVESTMENT IN THE
I MEAN IT MAKES INTUITIVE SENSE NEIGHBOURS KNOW WHICH NEIGHBOUR NEEDS HELP WHICH NEIGHBOUR IS

NOT REALLY A BIG DEAL
I HAD IT ALL FIGURED OUT
WHEN I WAS NINE I SAW THE MOVIE JAWS AND THOUGHT TO MYSELF NO THANK YOU
I WAS GOING TO BE A WRESTLER
WE GREW UP LEARNING TO CHEER ON THE UNDERDOG BECAUSE WE SEE OURSELVES IN THEM
MY GRANDMOTHER THOUGHT IT WAS CUTE AND BECAUSE THEY WERE MY FAVORITE SHE LET ME KEEP DOING IT
I THOUGHT THEY WERE BOTH PORK CHOPS
ONE DAY BEFORE I REALIZED FAT KIDS ARE NOT DESIGNED TO CLIMB TREES I FELL OUT OF A TREE AND BRUISED THE RIGHT
ONE OF THE FIRST LINES OF POETRY I CAN REMEMBER WRITING WAS IN RESPONSE TO A WORLD THAT DEMANDED I HATE MYSELF
TURNS OUT IT'S NOT THAT HARD TO TRICK SOMEONE AND ONE DAY BEFORE CLASS I SAID YEAH YOU CAN COPY MY HOMEWORK
WHEN I WAS 11 I WANTED TO BE LEFT ALONE
WE FOUND OURSELVES OUTNUMBERED DAY AFTER WRETCHED DAY
WE USED TO STAY INSIDE FOR RECESS BECAUSE OUTSIDE WAS WORSE
WHEN I WAS EIGHT I WANTED TO BE A MARINE BIOLOGIST
WE NEED TO FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THAT IMAGE
I THINK BY NOW WE CAN ALL AGREE AND CONFIDENTLY ANSWER THAT THE FUTURE ITS
SO AT THE SAME TIME I WOULD LIKE TO STRESS THAT SOCIETY NEEDS TO REEVALUATE ITS PERCEPTION OF YOUTH
I THINK WE CAN SOLVE THIS IF WE THINK CREATIVELY IF WE STEP OUTSIDE OF THE BOX AND COME UP WITH AN ATYPICAL
WORK YOUR WAY UP
AND JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE SAYS
AND THIS MISSION HAS A PERSONAL ROOT TO IT
IT DOES RAIN
MAYBE YOU HEAR A PROPELLER NOISE YOU LOOK UP THINKING IT'S GOING TO BE RIGHT ABOVE YOU BECAUSE IT SOUNDS SO CLOSE AND IT IS
WHAT IF THEIR FOOD MOVES AS WELL
TRY TO IMAGINE THAT YOU'RE DRIVING YOUR CAR OR RIDING YOU BIKE TO WORK
AND PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY THE NOISE THAT IS CREATED BY THESE SURVEYS IS ACTUALLY OPERATING AT A
WHAT WAS DIFFERENT THAN BEFORE
PRETTY HARD TO FOCUS RIGHT
SO HERE'S THE PROBLEM
IMAGINE IF YOU ADDED TO THAT NOISE CREATED BY SEISMIC SURVEYS NOISE CREATED BY DRILLING IN THE
SOUND AND HOW IT'S AFFECTING MARINE MAMMALS IN THE NORTH
IN 2010 UNITAID ESTABLISHED THE MEDICINES PATENT POOL FOR
IT RELIES ON THE WILLINGNESS OF PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES TO LICENSE THEIR PATENTS AND MAKE
AND THIS IS NO LONGER FANTASY
THIS IS FAIRLY RECENT SCIENCE THAT HAS SHOWN THAT
THIS ACTUALLY WASN'T SO GREAT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE AVIATION INDUSTRY AND THIS WAS AT A
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE MEDICINES PATENT POOL CANNOT DO
THEY WERE FORCED TO DO SO
THE COMPANY GILEAD THAT HOLDS THE PATENTS HAS LICENSED THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY TO THE MEDICINES
THE POOL IS ALREADY WORKING TODAY TWO MONTHS LATER WITH GENERIC MANUFACTURERS TO MAKE SURE
WHAT THAT MEANS IS WE HAVE THE TOOLS TO BREAK THE BACK OF THIS EPIDEMIC
THIS WAS AT A TIME THAT TREATMENT ACTUALLY EXISTED IN RICH COUNTRIES
AND THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
THEY ALSO STOP PASSING ON THE VIRUS
THEN IN THE 19TH CENTURY WE LAYER ON THE CONCEPT OF BUREAUCRACY AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE TO HELP US GOVERN COMPLEX
IT OPENS UP THE API TO ALLOW HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF NEW APPLICATIONS TO BE BUILT ON TOP OF IT
OBVIOUSLY OPENING UP THE DATA IS ONE BUT THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO CREATE LOTS MORE CREATE AND
AND WE KNOW THAT THE SMARTEST PERSON ALWAYS WORKS FOR SOMEONE ELSE
IT'S NOT ONLY THE BENEFITS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT WITH REGARD TO DEVELOPMENT
RUSSIA IS USING WIKIS TO GET CITIZENS WRITING LAW TOGETHER AS IS LITHUANIA
THERE WAS NO LEGAL PRECEDENT NO CULTURAL PRECEDENT NO TECHNICAL WAY OF DOING THIS
IT DOESN'T GET ANYBODY TO DO ANYTHING WITH THAT DATA TO CHANGE LIVES TO SOLVE PROBLEMS AND IT DOESN'T
NOW WHAT WE'RE SEEING LOTS OF EXAMPLES OF OBVIOUSLY IS THE OPENING UP OF GOVERNMENT DATA NOT ENOUGH EXAMPLES OF THIS
BECAUSE IT OPENS UP ITS PLATFORM
FRIENDING SOMEONE ON FACEBOOK IS NOT COMPLEX ENOUGH TO DO THE HARD WORK OF YOU AND I COLLABORATING
YOU CAN BARELY FILL OUT THE FORMS IN THAT AMOUNT OF TIME LET ALONE GENERATE REAL PALPABLE INNOVATIONS THAT IMPROVE
IT'S THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND THE JOB CREATION THAT'S COMING FROM THIS OPEN INNOVATION
SIMPLY THROWING DATA OVER THE TRANSOM DOESN'T CHANGE HOW GOVERNMENT WORKS
NOT IN A PASSIVE SOCIETY A READ ONLY SOCIETY BUT IN A WRITABLE SOCIETY WHERE WE HAVE THE
THEY'RE NOT FUN ENOUGH
WE HAVE A PRECEDENT FOR THIS
WE INVEST IN BROADBAND AND SCIENCE EDUCATION AND SCIENCE GRANTS BUT WE INVEST FAR TOO LITTLE
THEY CANNOT REPLACE GOVERNMENT
THERE IS A HERO IN ALL OF US IS THEIR SLOGAN
WHEN WE START TO SEE POWER OVER THE CORE FUNCTIONS OF GOVERNMENT SPENDING LEGISLATION
IN FACT MANY PEOPLE TOLD US IT WAS ILLEGAL
NEIGHBORS CAME AND WENT
WE WANTED NATURALLY TO ASK PUBLIC SECTOR EMPLOYEES HOW WE SHOULD OPEN UP GOVERNMENT
THEY'RE NOT EXCITING ENOUGH TO GET US ENGAGED IN THIS TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY THAT AWAITS US
TURNS OUT THAT HAD NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE
WE'VE HEARD TALK HERE AT TED ABOUT PEOPLE BIOHACKING AND HACKING THEIR PLANTS WITH
IT'S ALSO ABOUT CREATING GOVERNMENT
YOU MIGHT GET MORE CALM
I'M ASSUMING THERE ARE NOT MANY PEOPLE HERE WHO SPEAK ICELANDIC
AND RARER STILL WHEN ACCOMPANIED AS IN MY CASE BY SELF
I CAN SEE IT IN THEIR EYES
THEY WANT TO ASK ME SOMETHING
WITHOUT THE FALL THERE IS NO FALLING IN LOVE
THANKS A LOT
OK YOU MIGHT POSE THE QUESTION
SUBCONTRACTING IS WHEN ON THE ONE HAND YOU GET RID OF THE RISK AND ON THE OTHER HAND YOU LOWER THE COSTS
SO WHAT TERMS SUCH AS OUTSOURCING OR SUBCONTRACTING EXEMPLIFY IS THAT
BUT WHAT ALL THESE NEW TRENDS AND ALL THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES REINFORCE TODAY IN THE 21ST
WHY DID HE DIE
AND ESPECIALLY SO WHEN IT COMES TO LOVE
SO WHAT ALL THESE EXAMPLES SHOW ESPECIALLY MASTURDATING AND SOLO WEDDING IS THAT WE ARE
SO SOMEONE ELSE DOES THE JOB INSTEAD OF YOU
THIS IS THE NEWEST TREND FROM SEVERAL WEEKS AGO IN LOVE AFFAIRS
WHAT DOES IT MEAN
IT REACTS BOTH TO POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EMOTIONS LIKE SADNESS HAPPINESS PLEASURE OR
MY DISLIKE OF WORDS MADE ME EXCEL IN THE BETTER SUBJECTS SUCH AS PHYSICS MATHEMATICS AND
BUT ONE DAY I HAD TO CRY
DID YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF TEARS
GRANDMA INSTILLED IN MY MOTHER THE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION
UNFORTUNATELY HOWEVER THAT WAS NOT THE CASE FOR MR
MY CALL TO ACTION FOR YOU TODAY IS THAT YOU TAKE THE TIME AND INVEST IN TRANSITIONAL HOUSING FOR ONE OF THE MOST VULNERABLE SEGMENTS OF OUR
I WAS ONLY CALLED ONE NAME ALL DAY IT WASN'T THAT BAD
IT WILL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING
HE SAID THAT IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE FAMILY
BUT IT DEFINITELY DIDN'T DO THAT
BRANSON'S IDEA AND HIS HELP I THINK WE CAN REALLY KIND OF PUSH THE SYSTEM TO MOVE THIS QUICKER
IF SOMEBODY SMOKES TOO MANY CIGARETTES WE DO OUR BEST TO TRY AND HELP THEM STOP SMOKING TOO MANY
AND WE'VE SPENT TWO YEARS LOOKING AT THE WAR ON DRUGS
AND I THINK WITH MR
I HAVE 3 CHILDREN
I'VE BEEN IN PRISON FOR 19 YEARS NOW
JUST ONE THING LED ON TO ANOTHER
I THOUGHT I COULD GET AWAY WITH NOT PAYING SOME TAXES
AND ENDED UP A NIGHT IN PRISON
BUT THAT'S ANOTHER SUBJECT
IT S HORRIBLE TO THINK ABOUT
AND LIKE I SAID I GREW UP IN CANADA
IT IS NOT SUSTAINABLE
SO THAT'S WHAT I DID
SO I KNEW I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING BUT I WASN'T EXACTLY SURE WHAT OR HOW
SO I THOUGHT OK WELL HERE IS AN IDEA
AND I WAS ASKED TO VISUALIZE COMING ACROSS THE FINISH LINE ON A PODIUM FINISH WHICH I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT MEANT
AND I BECAME A MASTER OF ESCAPE
OTHERS OF YOU MAYBE TOOK THOSE IDEAS AND JUST PUT THEM ON THE SHELF FOR A LITTLE WHILE
TO CREATE YOUR OWN
I FELT LIKE AN IMPOSTOR
SO SOME OF YOU MAYBE TOOK THOSE IDEAS AND ACTUALLY TURNED THEM INTO REALITY RIGHT AWAY
GOSH IT'S GOTTA BE A SOLUTION SO WHAT IS THAT SOLUTION
AND I JUST THOUGHT
AND THAT PASSION IS WATER
YOU MAY ASK
AND WE NEED THEM TO BE HEALTHY TO SURVIVE
WELL LAST YEAR THAT NUMBER WAS 6
THEY FORMED A BOND
WHAT HAPPENS THEN
ALL OF THEIR HOMES WERE WASHED AWAY BY THE TSUNAMI TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO
HOW DO WE MAKE IT HAPPEN
YOU COULD FIGHT FOR YOUR COUNTRY YOU COULD DIE FOR YOUR COUNTRY YOU COULD SERVE IN YOUR COUNTRY'S CIVIL SERVICE BUT YOU DIDN'T
AND IF YOU MARRY THIS FACT WITH THE INCREDIBLE ABUNDANCE OF INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE IN OUR WORLD TODAY
OTHER EXAMPLES ARE RECYCLING
WE ALL KNOW WE NEED TO RECYCLE MORE
IT SOUNDS OLD FASHIONED BUT THEY WERE ONTO SOMETHING BACK THEN
SO LIFE WITHOUT SOCIAL MEDIA IS REALLY NOT SO BAD
WE'RE NOT WIRED FROM IT
YOU DON'T HAVE THE CONSTANT HUM OF STIMULI AND THE BACKGROUND HUM OF ANXIETY THAT COMES ALONG WITH THAT
MANY MORE PEOPLE WOULD BE MUCH BETTER OFF IF THEY DIDN'T USE THIS TECHNOLOGY
I JUST ASK THAT YOU DIRECT YOUR COMMENTS TOWARDS TWITTER
IT SHORT CIRCUITS THE BRAIN AND WE'RE STARTING TO FIND IT HAS ACTUAL COGNITIVE CONSEQUENCES ONE OF THEM BEING THIS SORT OF PERVASIVE
SO I NEVER SIGNED UP
BY DEFINITION THE MARKET IS NOT GOING TO GIVE A LOT OF VALUE TO THOSE BEHAVIORS
IT'S ONE THING TO SPEND A COUPLE OF HOURS AT A SLOT MACHINE IN LAS VEGAS BUT IF YOU BRING ONE WITH YOU AND YOU PULL THAT HANDLE ALL DAY LONG
BUT AS PEOPLE START BETRAYING THE SOCIAL GOOD WE ALL SUFFER AND WE ALL SUFFER TO A GREAT
AND NOT ONLY THAT THE PART OF THE BRAIN THAT GETS ACTIVATED WHEN PEOPLE PLOT AND EXECUTE REVENGE
BECAUSE THE PEOPLE RUNNING THAT STORE DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO HAVE THE PEN AND THE MONEY AT THE SAME TIME SO THEY CREATE THIS
IT'S TRUE YOU JUST LOST 100 BUT IF YOU GO INTO YOUR CHECKING ACCOUNT AND YOU WRITE
AS SOCIETY IS MOVING TOWARDS ELECTRONIC TRANSACTION DEALING WITH PEOPLE OVER GREAT DISTANCES WHAT
BESIDES FROM REVENGE BEING ALTRUISTIC
WHY WOULD PEOPLE FEEL PLEASURE WHEN THEY EXECUTE REVENGE
SO WHAT'S THE LESSON FROM THIS
WE ALL BENEFIT FROM THIS
HOW WELL DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME
I LOVE ALL OF THESE WOMEN I ADMIRE THEM I AM FRIENDS WITH ALL OF THEM BUT THIS IS THE ONE I AM GOING TO SPEND THE REST OF
WHAT YOU'RE REALLY TELLING THEM IS
AND ABOUT AN HOUR AFTER THAT WE WERE INVITED TO GO BACK AND SEE HIM
I START TO LOOK AROUND AND I SEE WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE HAS
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT WE COULD CHANGE OUR LIVES AND FIND THAT PURPOSE MEANING AND JOY
THEY PLAY LOTS OF TRIALS WITH DIFFERENT AMOUNTS EACH TIME
THEY'RE INTERESTED IN WORKING MEMORY
THIS EXPERIMENT'S BEEN DONE MANY MANY TIMES
THIS GOES BACK QUITE A WAYS
YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO LOOK AT BRAIN ACTIVITY AND SAY THIS PERSON'S GOING TO BE A GOOD POKER PLAYER OR THIS PERSON'S SOCIALLY NAIVE AND WE MIGHT ALSO
YOUR INTUITION MIGHT TELL YOU THAT TOO
SOME OF THESE WILL SOUND FAMILIAR BECAUSE YOU PROBABLY ARE THINKING THAT WAY
IT'S SOMETHING THAT I'VE WORKED ON AND A FEW OTHER PEOPLE AND IT INDICATES A KIND OF HIERARCHY ALONG WITH SOME ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT HOW MANY
THE DRIZZLE OF GOLD EMBRACING THE PUNGENT SCENT OF UNTOUCHED
WHAT AM I TRYING TO GET AT IS
I FOR ONE I AM GLAD THAT THEY SCREEN CARS NOWADAYS
THE AIRPLANE WAS INVENTED BY THE WRIGHT BROTHERS AND WAS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF WORLD WAR I
THEY'RE ACTUALLY CAUSING TIME TO GO FASTER
EVERYTHING WAS NEW
LET ME SHOW YOU WHY
HOW DO YOU MAXIMIZE THE SECOND LAW OF EXPERIENTIAL TIME
SAME GOES FOR YOUR BRAIN
WHY IS THIS
MAYBE YOU TAKE A HALF DAY AT WORK
NO THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS CHRONOLOGICAL TIME
THERE'S A RANGE BUT APPROXIMATELY AROUND THE SAME PLACE
AND SUMMERS LAST FOREVER
E MC2 EVERYBODY IS FAMILIAR WITH THIS FORMULA THE LAW OF RELATIVITY
AND THEY HAVE AN INCREDIBLE DEPTH OF EXPERIENCE
AND IT WAS ABOUT THIS POINT IN MY LIFE THAT MY OBSESSION WITH TIME MORPHED
HE SAID GOODBYE TO THEM WHILE HE SHARED WITH THEM THE MEANING THAT THEY HAD HAD IN HIS LIFE
SOMEHOW OUR BRAINS ARE CONTRACTING
WE REALLY LIVED EVERYTHING WE DID
LET'S TRY TO SLOW DOWN TIME TRY TO EXPAND TIME TRY TO CREATE TIME
TIME FLOWS THROUGH YOUR AND MY BRAIN JUST LIKE WATER THROUGH A GARDEN HOSE
TRADE AWESOME DAY FOR A BORING WEEK
THEY WANT TO FIND THEIR RELATIVES OR MAYBE MEET THE BLACK SHEEP IN THEIR FAMILY
WITHOUT BIOBANKS WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO HELP ARIELA
SO MY LAB CONDUCTED AN EMPIRICAL TEST
AND EVENTUALLY WE FOUND A MATCH TO ANOTHER Y CHROMOSOME
BUT I FOUND THAT WE HAVE BIOBANKS
WHEN SCIENTISTS ACCESS THE DNA IN THESE BIOBANKS THEY DON'T GET THE NAME OR CONTACT
AND I WANTED TO TRY TO HACK IT AND TO SEE IF I CAN BREACH THE PRIVACY OF THESE PARTICIPANTS
I DON'T THINK ANYONE DOES
THEY'RE WILLING TO OPEN UP A NEW SPACE FOR CITIZEN ENGAGEMENT AND
AND I'M TELLING A STORY THAT MANY OF YOU KNOW BECAUSE STEVE'S COLUMNS BECAME THE BASIS FOR A BOOK WHICH WAS
WE NEED TO DO MORE IN THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM
AND 28 OF THE PEOPLE DO THAT WITHIN THREE YEARS
BUT WE JUST CAN'T THROW AWAY THESE KIDS
THE STATE OF WASHINGTON HAS A BAN IT'S ILLEGAL TO SPEND A DIME OF STATE MONEY ON HIGHER EDUCATION
WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO IDENTIFY WHY WE HAVE THOSE COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES AND RECOGNIZE THAT THEY
SO WHEN I THINK ABOUT CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM I STEP BACK
AND WE NEVER KEPT THAT PROMISE
SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM I THINK ABOUT IT IN THREE DIFFERENT STEPS
AND WE ARE AT 100 CAPACITY RIGHT NOW
OR WHERE THEY CAN IDENTIFY WHAT THE PROBLEM IS WHY THEY CAN'T BEHAVE
SWIMMING IS MY WAY INTO THE UNDERWATER WORLD THAT SOME PEOPLE NEVER GET TO SEE
ALL THE FISH WERE GONE
ONE TIME I WAS GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF SAM PONDS SEARCHING FOR POLLYWOGS WHEN SOMETHING SLIMY BRUSHED UP
EVEN THOUGH I BELIEVE THAT IT'S TERRIBLE THAT PEOPLE TRASH OUR LAKES AND RIVERS THIS ISN'T A TALK ABOUT POLLUTION IT'S
BEING IN THE WATER IS NEVER BORING FOR ME BECAUSE I ALWAYS FIND SOMETHING FUN TO DO LIKE DIVING DOWN
THERE WAS NOTHING TO SEE
THE TSUNAMI WAVE BOUNCED ALL THE AWAY FROM JAPAN AND HIT HAWAII AND CAUSED A LOT DAMAGE WHERE WE WERE STAYING IN THE KONA
WHAT DOES YOUR UNDERWATER WORLD LOOK LIKE
IT TURNED OUT TO BE A PRETTY GROSS LOOKING PLANT
AT THAT POINT I FELT PRETTY RIDICULOUS SO I LOOKED AROUND TO SEE IF ANYBODY WAS WATCHING ME
THE ONLY REASON I'M ABLE TO INVESTIGATE THE BOTTOMS OF THOSE LAKES AND RIVERS IS BECAUSE I'M A STRONG SWIMMER
RUSTY NAILS AND ROTTEN WOOD
THESE WEIRD CLEAR BLOBS THAT LOOK LIKE JELLYFISH
AND OF COURSE FISH CRAWDADS AND ROCKS WHICH ARE ALL SUPPOSED TO BE AT THE BOTTOM OF A LAKE OR
WASN'T VERY FLATTERING I CAN TELL YOU THAT
WE'LL GET BETTER AT THINGS WE DO
WITH ALL THAT SUCCESS ALL THE SUDDEN I'M UNEMPLOYED
WE NEED TO KEEP PUSHING THAT UP AND WE WILL PUSH IT UP
TODAY THOUGH YOU KNOW WE KEPT IT UP
WE HAVE A FOUNDATION THAT WE GIVE MONEY AWAY
I HOPE SOMEDAY WE CAN HELP OUT THE UNDOCUMENTED KIDS
THERE WERE LAWSUITS IT WAS A LOT OF PAIN
I USED TO WORK FOR A BIG COMPANY CALLED UNICAL
SOME OF YOU FROM THE WEST COAST MAY REMEMBER IT USED TO BE A BIG OIL AND GAS FIRM AND REFINERY
MANAGERS THERE WERE AFRAID OF FAILURE
NOT JUST IN PAKISTAN BUT IN THE WORLD
OUR STRINGS ARE WHAT CAN LIGHT THE BRIGHTEST FIRE WITHIN US
A TINY DROP IN A COSMIC OCEAN YES BUT SOMETIMES ONE DROP IS ALL IT TAKES TO
AND THE FIRE BURNT HARD
KIDS ALL OVER THE ENDS OF PAKISTAN WERE DREAMING BIG AUDACIOUS DREAMS OF BECOMING
INSTEAD IF EACH OF US EMBRACED OUR STRINGS NOT SO THAT WE CAN BE TIED DOWN BY THEM BUT SO WE CAN
WHEN I WAS TWO MY PARENTS WANTING TO GIVE MY BROTHER AND I A PROPER EDUCATION DECIDED THAT THEY WOULD MOVE
THIS WAS MY RESPONSIBILITY THIS WAS MY OPPORTUNITY
WITH NO PROPER SCHOOLS AROUND WE WERE HOMESCHOOLED MUCH OF OUR LIVES
HE WAS GIVEN ROUGHLY 1000 DAYS TO LIVE
WHILE OUR STRINGS CAN HOLD US BACK OUR STRINGS CAN ALSO GIVE US DIRECTION
I ASKED WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE WHEN YOU GROW UP
AND DEVISED A PLAN AGAINST THEM
HE STRETCHED THOSE STRINGS FAR AND WIDE AND HE CHALLENGED THEM JUST AS MUCH AS HIS STRINGS
IN THAT MOMENT I FELT I ALONE BORE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO TOUCH THIS ONE KID'S
I KNEW THE CHILDREN OF AKRI DREAMED THE SAME DREAMS I DID AND WE SHARED THE SAME STRINGS
AS HE WAS STARTING HIS LIFE AT HARVARD HIS ENTIRE WORLD CHANGED AROUND HIM IN A MATTER OF DAYS
MY BROTHER MADE HIS WAY TO STANFORD
THINK ABOUT IT
I TOOK THEIR PICTURES SO I WOULD ALWAYS REMEMBER THEM AND I ASKED THEM WHAT THEY WANTED TO BE WHEN THEY GROW UP
WITH THE SUPPORT OF AN AMAZING GROUP OF FRIENDS COLLEAGUES AND PARTNERS WE FORMED OUR ORGANIZATION THE
I WAS LOOKING THROUGH THE LENS OF MY CAMERA
HOW COULD HE ABANDON HIS FAMILY HIS COMMUNITY
SO HERE I AM IN SPIRIT
TO DATE MY MOTHER MUST HAVE TAKEN CARE OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS OUR ENTIRE
WHAT IF WE COULD QUESTION THEM CHALLENGE THEM RESHAPE AND REFORM THEM
THE KID WITH THE PIERCING EYES WITH THE SLIGHT HESITATION IN HIS VOICE LOOKED AT ME AND HE SAID
AND THIS WAS A VERY DAUNTING PROSPECT CONSIDERING MY SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND WAS AT THE UNDERGRADUATE LEVEL
BUT HOW COULD MY ELECTRONIC DEVICES HARNESS THIS ENERGY
WHY HADN'T SOMEBODY ELSE THOUGHT OF IT BEFORE
HOW CAN ONE THING ONE TECHNOLOGY BE APPLIED TO SOMETHING ELSE IN THE WORLD
SO IN OTHER WORDS BY VIRTUE OF HAVING PERSPECTIVE WE LACK PERSPECTIVE
JUST BY THINKING ABOUT THE PROBLEM DIFFERENTLY AND BY ASKING A LOT OF QUESTIONS
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE AS EXCITING AS INVOLVING FLAMES AND EXPLOSIONS LIKE MY CHEMISTRY PROFESSOR
IT'S ABOUT ONE TENTH THE DIAMETER OF THE STRAND OF HUMAN HAIR
AND OF COURSE ONE OF MY PERSONAL FAVORITE WAYS TO INCREASE DOPAMINE
FOR EXAMPLE I HAD A CHEMISTRY PROFESSOR ON THE VERY FIRST DAY OF CLASS DO AN INTENSE REACTION WITH
THIS REACTION WAS DONE JUST USING REGULAR TAP WATER AND SODIUM
THE ELECTRODE END CONSISTS OF A SINGLE STRAND OF CARBON FIBER
ONE WINTER DAY A FEW YEARS AGO I WAS SITTING AT MY KITCHEN TABLE WRITING ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED
I KNOW THIS NOW
WE ARE THE WEALTH US
I OFFERED THE IDEA THAT
SO WHEN YOU GO TO A BANK DID YOU THINK THAT THE BANK HAD THE MONEY TO LEND YOU WHEN YOU BORROW IT
IT'S A BARTER ECONOMY
WE'RE NOW OVER 22 IN COLORADO
IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS BUILT INTO THE SCHOOL GROUND
IT'S PART OF THE PLAYGROUND
EAST MEETS WEST IN THE DEEP SOUTH
HE WAS SQUIRMING JUMPING AND RUNNING FROM THE MAT
AT THE END OF THE 30 HOURS THEIR MINDS WERE SHARP AND FOCUSED AND ON
THE STAFF WASN'T SAFE
WHEN THE MIND WONDERS THEY HAVE TO COME BACK TO THE BREATH OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN
SO FINALLY IN THAT MOMENT WITH THAT WISE ADVISE HE SAT AND WENT INSIDE AND FACED HIMSELF
WAYNE WAS UNABLE TO SIT AND FOCUS
THEY COULDN'T BE PROVOKED OR UPSET SO EASILY
EVERYBODY WAS THINKING
BUT WHEN I FIRST STARTED DOCUMENTING THIS STORY I THOUGHT MAYBE THE DHAMMA BROTHERS CAN BECOME TEACHERS
AS MEMORIES ROSE TO THE SURFACE THEY HAD TO FACE THOSE MEMORIES
BIG ED HAD TO FACE THE THAT HIS DAUGHTER HAD DIED
IT REQUIRES 100 HOURS OF MEDITATION IN SILENCE AND STILLNESS OVER A 10 DAY PERIOD OF
NOBODY WANTED TO WORK THERE IT WAS ALWAYS UNDERSTAFFED BECAUSE NOBODY WANTED TO GO TO DONALDSON
NOBODY FELT SAFE
THE PRISONERS WEREN'T SAFE
WHEN DEPRESSION BECOMES SEVERE SUICIDAL THOUGHTS ARE COMMON
AND WHAT IF IT DIDN'T WORK
DESPITE GOVERNMENT PROMISES OF EXTRA CASH MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES HAVE STRUGGLED WITH YEARS OF
THINKING I'D ALREADY HIT ROCK BOTTOM I NOW CONTEMPLATED A LIFE AS A SOCIAL PARIAH
WE HAD A HOLIDAY PLANNED THEY'D HAVE TIME TO BURY ME GRIEVE TAKE A HOLIDAY TO GET OVER IT
BUT THAT WOULDN'T BE FAIR ON THE DRIVER
ANYWAY I CAN RECALL REMEMBERING THINKING THAT THEY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT HOW THIS WHOLE CUSTOM OF BLACK MEN DRESSING AND
AND FOR THOSE OF US WHO DO UNDERSTAND OUR ACTIONS MIGHT NOT NECESSARILY REFLECT THAT UNDERSTANDING
HOWEVER THE IMPORTANCE OF MUSIC WITHIN THE BODY OF CULTURE IS UNDENIABLE
AND I DON'T KNOWS
SO HOW WILL YOU CHANGE THE WORLD
WHAT THESE APPS ALL HAVE IN COMMON IS THEY'RE TAKING PREVIOUSLY INVISIBLE
THAT'S ABOUT ONE THIRD OF CHINA'S URBAN POPULATION IN A WEEKEND
MY FAMILY HAD SEEN SUMMER HEAT SO INTENSE THAT IT SPLIT ANCIENT OAK TREES
AND WE'VE SEEN OUR NEIGHBORS DEVASTATED BY HUNDREDS OF WILDFIRES
MOST OF US ALREADY KNOW THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS A HUGE PROBLEM BUT THE BIG
SO RESEARCH IN MY LAB IS NOW ADDRESSING THIS GAP
WITH THIS INFORMATION WE CAN EXPAND OUR ASSESSMENT METHODS TO OTHER CONDITIONS THAT CAN INTERFERE WITH ENTRAINMENT
I LEFT CLINICAL PRACTICE AND WENT INTO RESEARCH TO SEARCH FOR ANSWERS
IMAGINE THE POSITIVE IMPACT THE MEMORABLE GUEST EXPERIENCES THE BRIDGES
AND ALSO IT SHOWED US THE POWER AND THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL MEDIA AS MICROBLOG
THEY'RE NOT RICH AT ALL
I SAW CHINA EMBRACING THE WORLD AND VICE VERSA
AND FOR THOSE WHO ARE READY TO GET MARRIED AND BUY THEIR APARTMENT THEY FIGURED OUT THEY HAVE TO WORK FOR 30
FIRST OF ALL WHO ARE THEY
SO AS SUSAN BOYLE WAS SAYING THAT 80000 LIVE AUDIENCE SANG TOGETHER
I SUMMONED MY COURAGE AND POISE AND SAID YES BUT COULD YOU LET ME KNOW WHAT ACTUALLY DO YOU
I WAS REPRESENTING THE SHANGHAI EXPO
WE TOOK EVERY VACATION TOGETHER
SO WE DID GET BACK TOGETHER
ABOUT THIS TIME REN E RICHARDS WAS COMING UP AND A FEW OTHERS BUT IT WAS SO REMOTE THAT IT JUST DIDN'T SEEM LIKE
I WAS NEVER A COWBOY
THIS IS NOT JUST WEARING WOMEN'S CLOTHES THIS IS NOT JUST EXPRESSING MY FEMININE SELF THIS IS SOMETHING DEEPER
HOW MANY IN THIS ROOM WERE BORN MEN
HE WAS WRONG I AM NOT MALE
THE PERSON SAYS YES
WE USE THESE THINGS AS STOPGAPS FOR THINGS THAT WE CAN'T EXPLAIN
NOTHING GOT BETTER
AND I'VE DONE OVER 70 INVESTIGATIONS LIKE THIS WITH MY CO HOST ROSS
DO YOU AGREE WITH IT
PRETTY FAMILIAR STORY RIGHT
A SKILLED COGNITIVE THERAPIST CAN HELP YOU CHANGE YOUR BRAIN TO STRENGTHEN THE CONNECTIONS THAT SUPPRESS FEAR
WE SET UP A WEB SITE CALLED GALAXY ZOO
WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO INSTEAD IS LOOK FOR THE INDIRECT SIGNS THAT THEY'RE THERE
SOMETHING ELSE VERY INTERESTING HAPPENS WHEN YOU INVITE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TO TAKE PART IN YOUR RESEARCH
WE'RE GOING TO SEE ALL THE ASTEROIDS WHIZZING AROUND THE SOLAR SYSTEM
AND SO WE NEEDED A NEW SOLUTION
THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE TODAY
IT'S GOING TO SCAN THE WHOLE SKY ONCE EVERY 3 NIGHTS
THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT CONFRONTS SCIENTISTS IN FIELD AFTER FIELD AFTER FIELD
BUT BECAUSE WE HAD SO MANY EYES AND WE COULD PAY INDIVIDUAL ATTENTION TO EACH IMAGE WE WERE ABLE TO
AND IT'S NO EXAGGERATION TO SAY IT'S GOING PROVIDE A MOVIE OF THE UNIVERSE
WE COULD PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT IT IS THAT MACHINES CAN DO
AND THEN WE MADE THE NICE IMAGE SO THAT THEY COULD TRY AND IMAGE WHAT THAT PLANET WAS LIKE
HE INSPIRED MANY OTHER PEOPLE TO COME TO GALAXY ZOO AND JOIN IN
WE DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS THERE
AND PLANET HUNTERS 1B IS CURRENTLY A UNIQUE WORLD
WE DECIDED TO CALL FOR HELP
BUT THERE'S A PROBLEM
THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE DON'T REALLY LIKE THE UNIVERSE THAT WE'VE ENDED UP WITH
WE'VE GOT THIS 96 OF THE UNIVERSE IN A FORM THAT WE DON'T UNDERSTAND
MAYBE THEY CAN CLASSIFY THE ROUTINE EVENTS
WHO IS THAT PERSON
POWERED BY FOSSIL FUEL DERIVED ENERGY
WASTEFUL ABUSIVE AND FOCUSED ON LABOR PRODUCTIVITY
THIS HAS PAID ALL THE COSTS FOR THE TRANSFORMATION OF INTERFACE
WHAT MAKES THEM TICK
WE CONSULT GROUPS OF KIDS IN OUR OFFICE EVERY WEEK THAT TELL US HOW THEY WANT TO LEARN
AND MORE THAN 500 MILLION EXTRA MINUTES OF TIME AFTER SCHOOL HAS BEEN SPENT LEARNING
WHAT ARE THEIR FAVORITE GAMES
HAVE FUN CHANGING EDUCATION
WHAT'S THAT LAW
SEVEN YEARS AGO I WAS THE PROUD YOUNG FATHER OF A SON GIJS AGED THREE AND A DAUGHTER LARA AGED
THEY WERE HAVING FUN AND THEREFORE CONTINUED
FIVE YEARS SINCE LAUNCHED HUNDRED OF THOUSANDS OF KIDS HAVE ACCESSED TO SQULA
I DON'T WANT TO ROMANTICIZE POVERTY
WOULD THE RACIAL PROBLEMS IN THE UNITED STATES BE WHAT THEY ARE
WE'RE WITH YOU
THE NEXT MINUTE TEN BECAUSE THEY'RE GETTING AWAKE I GUESS
I ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW
DURING THE FIRST MINUTE WELL THEY WERE SLEEPING
IT CERTAINLY HAS AN UPPER BOUND
LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE
AND SOMETIMES SOLVING A PROBLEM IS ALL ABOUT CHANGING YOUR PERSPECTIVE
THE SECOND MINUTE
THERE'S A LIKELIHOOD THAT YOUR PROBLEM WAS ACTUALLY SOLVED BY THOSE MATHEMATICIANS BUT I CAN'T BLAME YOU FOR NOT KNOWING ENOUGH MATH
I KNOW THAT THEY MEAN THAT THEY HATED IT AND THEY'RE DONE WITH IT AND THEY'LL NEVER HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT AGAIN
IS THIS ACTUALLY TESTING WHETHER I KNOW THAT 3 4 LIES BETWEEN 1 2 AND 1
NOW WE'RE AIMING TO MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTE BOATS AND BOAT KITS BY THE END OF THIS YEAR
I WAS ABLE TO USE PRECOMPILED CODE LIBRARIES AND FOLLOW OTHER SCHEMATICS AND IN DOING SO I WAS ABLE TO
IT'S FROM THESE OPEN COLLABORATIVE COMMUNITIES THAT COMES THE AMAZING POTENTIAL BUT IT'S
THE DUNES HERE MOVE SOUTHWARD AT A PACE OF AROUND 600 METERS A YEAR
THIS IS A CATASTROPHE WAITING TO HAPPEN AGAIN
NOW AS ARCHITECTS WE'RE TRAINED TO SOLVE PROBLEMS
WHAT RON CAME TO FIND WAS THAT NETWORKS AND PEOPLE'S SUCCESS IS DEFINED BY
NO I DIDN'T SAY IPHONE I SAID A FLIP CAMERA GOOGLE THAT THEY ARE CIRCA 2006 AND I'D GO
I LIKE TO THINK OF MY LIFE AS HOW CAN I SPREAD WARMTH AND GENEROSITY TO EACH AND EVERY PERSON THAT I MEET IN
THE FIRST FOR THOSE IN THE ROOM THAT MAY BE OVER 25 MAYBE 30 THIS IS WHAT NETWORKING LOOKS LIKE
ONE OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS IS A NETWORK SCIENTIST BY THE NAME OF RON BURT
AND I WOULD SAY WITH CONFIDENCE WE DO HAVE ROADS AND WE HAVE INTERNET IN OMAHA NEBRASKA
WE HAVE THOSE SAME INDIVIDUALS HERE
THEY WERE FLYING UNDER THE RADAR
IT'S ALSO ON THE ONE BOOK ONE LINCOLN LIST FOR THIS YEAR
I'VE HAD SOMEONE WRITE AND SAY SCIENTIFICALLY SPEAKING WHAT IS THE BEST AND FASTEST WAY TO HIDE A
HOW MUCH ROOM IS THAT
AND IN FACT YOU CAN JUST LOOK AT PIZZA DELIVERY DRIVERS
BUT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ARE AFRAID RIGHT
WE DO STUPID THINGS
BUT NOT JUST EVERYDAY
CAN WE DO THIS MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY
CAN WE WAKE UP
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL WORLD THAT WOULD BE
BUT THE THING IS TO DO A LOT MORE OF THAT
LET'S THINK ABOUT IT AND WHAT IT MEANS BUT PLEASE LET'S NOT DO MORE OF THAT
AND ACTUALLY WE'VE DONE THIS WITH THE TEEB PROJECT
SO CLEARLY THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH DEFORESTATION
SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE SOME MOVEMENT FORWARD
I'M FINE AND YOU
WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THE NATIONAL PRIDE
I KNOW WHAT LANGUAGE STANDARDS ARE
BUT IT TURNS OUT IT WAS THE LANGUAGE
IT SEEMS LIKE AN IMPORTANT THING
FOR ME AVIATION ENGLISH CAME AT A JUNCTION WHERE MY BACKGROUND AND
AND THE BABY PILOT I AM I SEE I AM WAY TOO HIGH I SEE THE RUNWAY WAY OVER THERE
I HAD NO IDEA EXCEPT TO SAY PLEASE GOD THIS IS WAY BIGGER THAN ME
SO I DECIDED I HAD TO LEARN HOW TO FLY
IT WAS A LANGUAGE ISSUE
WE SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE AND WE LIVE IN THE SAME FAMILY
LIFE HAPPENS IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME
IN AVIATION IT IS SCARY WHEN LIFE HAPPENS
I THINK THAT REALLY LEADS NOWHERE
YOU TRY IT OUT
SAME THING WITH THE HUNTER GATHERER TRIBES AND EARLY MAN YOU DIDN'T LIVE BEYOND THE AGE OF 30
BUT A BETTER WAY IS WHAT I CALL THE PROACTIONARY PRINCIPLE WHICH IS YOU ENGAGE WITH TECHNOLOGY
IS REALLY TO ALIGN OURSELVES WITH THIS FORCE MUCH GREATER THAN OURSELVES
IT WAS A VERY SHORT LIFE
SO ANOTHER WAY TO THINK ABOUT TECHNOLOGY WHAT IT MEANS IS TO IMAGINE A WORLD WITHOUT TECHNOLOGY
WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE
AND IF YOU GO THERE YOU SAY HEY EVERYBODY'S REALLY HEALTHY
I'M 50 YEARS OLD MAYBE I HAVE ANOTHER 20 YEARS LEFT
HOW DO I GET PEOPLE TO CARE
IN MY HOMETOWN OF LINCOLN NEBRASKA
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO
SO THEY'RE NOT JUST DOING THE AUTUMN WINTER THE SPRING SUMMER THEY'RE ALSO HAVING TO WORK ON PRE FALL
WHAT REALLY HAPPENS IS THAT WE'RE NOW LOOKING AT RATHER THAN TWO OR FOUR SEASONS A YEAR WE'RE
SO THE HIGH STREET BRANDS HAVE REALLY DEMOCRATIZED STYLE YOU'RE ABLE TO GET HOLD OF IT
AND THESE ARE BIG BIG NAMES GOING OUT THERE INTO THIS MULTI BILLION POUND SECTOR AND REPRESENTING BRITISH
HOW DID THEY ACTUALLY MANAGE IT
BECAUSE WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE DEVELOPED A WHOLE NEW SYSTEM OF GETTING DRESSED WHICH REVOLVES AROUND
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH IT
I'M 40 YEARS OLD
WE CAN FIND THE HUMAN SIDE IN THIS CONFLICT WHICH IS WHAT NO ONE CARES ABOUT ALL THE POLITICIANS
WHEN I MET FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE RAMI ELHANAN AN ISRAELI HE LOST HIS DAUGHTER
I'M AN ISRAELI
AND THIS IS OUR MISSION OUR HOLY MISSION AND IT WILL BE FOREVER
SO THE JEWISH SOCIETY WE HAVE PERSPECTIVE
I HAVE THREE SONS
TODAY TOGETHER IN THE PARENTS CIRCLE THE BEREAVED FAMILIES FORUM YES WE ARE
I WILL NEVER FORGET WHAT HAPPENED TO ME
THERE IS NO FREE MOVEMENT FOR THE HUMAN BEINGS
A BIG CONFLICT BIG QUESTIONS WHAT CAN I DO AS A HUMAN BEING
COM AND SYMBOLICS
SO THE BASIC IDEA OF I
I KNEW THEM BOTH
WE'VE FLOWN THE CASSINI SPACECRAFT BY THIS MOON NOW SEVERAL TIMES FLYING
AND THE TINY WATER CRYSTALS HERE NOW LOOK FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE THEY ARE FROZEN DROPLETS OF
WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE LIVING ORGANISMS THERE OF COURSE IS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT MATTER
AND THAT WILL HAVE TO AWAIT THE ARRIVAL BACK AT ENCELADUS OF THE SPACECRAFTS
THEY CUT ME LITERALLY CUT ME IN HALF
I HAD ONE ARM IN PLASTER ONE ARM TIED DOWN BY DRIPS
THEN THEY STITCHED ME UP THEY TOOK AN ENTIRE HOUR TO STITCH ME UP
I WAS NO LONGER TIED TO A SET PATH
MY HEAD WAS CUT OPEN ACROSS THE FRONT LIFTED BACK EXPOSING THE SKULL UNDERNEATH
THEY TOOK OUT TWO OF MY BROKEN RIBS AND THEY REBUILT MY BACK L1 THEY REBUILT IT THEY TOOK OUT
AND I SAID WHAT
I HAD TIGHT STOCKINGS ON TO PROTECT FROM BLOOD CLOTS
I HAD NO MOVEMENT IN MY LEGS
I WANTED MY OLD LIFE BACK
I SAID WELL I HAVE TO GET A FRIEND TO DRIVE ME BECAUSE I CAN'T DRIVE
AND THEN I THOUGHT WHY STOP THERE
I HAD A NECK BRACE AND SANDBAGS ON EITHER SIDE OF MY HEAD AND I SAW MY WORLD THROUGH A MIRROR THAT WAS SUSPENDED
I WOKE UP IN INTENSIVE CARE AND THE DOCTORS WERE REALLY EXCITED THAT THE OPERATION HAD BEEN A SUCCESS BECAUSE AT THAT
YOU'LL HAVE TO USE A CATHETER FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
IS THAT A PROBLEM
I BROKE MY RIGHT ARM
I BROKE MY COLLARBONE
I BROKE SOME BONES IN MY FEET
YOU'RE IN A WHEELCHAIR
NOW INDIAN WOMEN WERE REALLY SMART IN THIS SITUATION
WE NEED TO LOOK AT IT FROM THE GROUND UPWARDS
ONE OF THE LEADING CAUSES OF ECONOMIC GROWTH ACROSS THAT REGION WAS THIS CULTURAL TREND
JOIN THE CONVERSATION
I HAD A PLAN FOR MY FUTURE
WHEN THEY WENT TO GET AN IUD INSERTED THEY GOT PAID SIX RUPEES
BUT THE CHOICES HAVE TO BE MADE AT THE FAMILY LEVEL
AND I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT IT THOUGH FROM A DIFFERENT LENS
FAMILY SIZES ARE COMING DOWN NATURALLY ALL OVER THE WORLD
WE NEED A GROUNDSWELL OF PEOPLE SAYING THIS MAKES SENSE
WE LOOKED AT IT FROM TOP DOWN AND SAID WE WANT TO HAVE DIFFERENT POPULATION NUMBERS OVER TIME
SWEEPING CHANGES START AT THE INDIVIDUAL FAMILY LEVEL THE FAMILY MAKING A DECISION ABOUT
AND WE NEED TO START NOW
AND SO I HOPE THEY'LL FEEL THAT I'M LIVING OUT WHAT I'VE LEARNED FROM THEM AND FROM THE DECADES OF WORK THAT I'VE ALREADY
I WANTED TO GO TO COLLEGE
THAT'S ABOUT WHAT YOU'D EXPECT
THEIR CONTRACEPTION RATE 29 PERCENT
WOMEN IN AFRICA WILL TELL YOU OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT WHAT THEY PREFER TODAY IS AN INJECTABLE
WE'VE GOT TO GIVE ALL WOMEN ACCESS NO MATTER WHERE THEY LIVE
YOU CAN TEACH OTHER PEOPLE
THEY'RE NOT PAYING ATTENTION
YOU'VE BEEN SITTING FOR AWHILE SO THE PHYSICAL RELIEF GETTING TO SHAKE IT OUT
BECAUSE THERE AREN'T THAT MANY PEOPLE WHO KNOW HOW TO PLAY WE HAVE TO KIND OF ACCELERATE THE PROGRAM MORE THAN A GAME LIKE CHESS
THIS IS TRUE SO IF YOU PLAY THIS GAME WITH ME TODAY FOR JUST ONE SINGLE MINUTE YOU WILL GET TO FEEL
WE HAD EXCITEMENT
YOU HEARD THAT SOUND GO UP IN THE ROOM
HOW MANY OF YOU WON JUST WON THUMB
SO ERIC WOULD HAVE WON
I WILL JUST LEAVE YOU WITH THIS TIP IF YOU WANT TO PLAY AGAIN
WE CAN REALLY GO FOR IT
IF YOU HAVE A FREE THUMB WAVE IT AROUND TO MAKE SURE
HOW ABOUT SURPRISE
THEY LOOK KIND OF WEAK
YOU WERE LIKE WHAT THE HELL IS SHE TALKING ABOUT
YOU GOT TO STAND UP
NOW YOU KNOW HOW TO PLAY IT
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU WERE AT TED AND YOU GOT TO CONNECT PHYSICALLY WITH EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THE ROOM
HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE LIKE ME
JUST ADMIT IT
I SAID MASSIVELY MULTIPLAYER THUMB WRESTLING
SO I DECIDED TO WALK AROUND
I LOVE NATALIE
SO IT'S JUST ENOUGH TO TAKE CARE OF OTHER PEOPLE TO TAKE CARE OF WHAT SURROUNDS US TO ENJOY
I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO GO AND HE WAS WALKING IN THE SAME WAY
BUT MY WAY OF DOING IT WAS LIKE HEY I'M CRISTINA I GOT CANCER
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN BETWEEN THE HOSTEL AND THE FLIGHT
I'LL TELL YOU
I SPENT ONE WEEK THERE
SO WHY ARE WE DISCOVERING UNACCEPTABLE SIDE EFFECTS ON HALF THE POPULATION AFTER THAT
AND THANKFULLY SCIENTISTS LIKE DR
AND I REALIZED A LONG TIME AGO THAT IF I CHALLENGE PEOPLE TO BUILD THE EQUIPMENT THEY NEED OUT OF THE GARBAGE
THAT'S THE BEWILDERING START OF BEING A BABY
IN FACT THAT'S THE JOB OF LAUGHTER
THE MEDITATION INSTRUCTION IS VERY SIMPLE
WHAT AM I DOING
WHAT'S THE MEANING OF LIFE
IN FACT THE DALAI LAMA HAVE ANY OF YOU HEARD OF HIM
IS THIS A KID THAT CAN SIT FOR A NEBULIZER TREATMENT
THAT MEANS THAT I CAN'T CURE MY ABUSE AND THAT THERE WILL BE NO ESCAPING IT UNTIL I DIE
YOU TALKED ABOUT THAT
AND THE OTHER PEOPLE SAID OH MY GOD
YOU'RE SO RESILIENT YOU SURVIVED
CLEARLY SOMETHING IMPORTANT IS GOING ON
BUT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO FIRST IS GIVE YOU A TASTE OF THE OPENING NUMBER
PERHAPS HE WAS NOT VERY CONFIDENT INSIDE WHEN HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SUPREMELY CONFIDENT OF HIS
AND IF YOU WATCHED THE BRAZILIAN PLAYERS THEIR HEADS DROPPED
HE WAS EXTREMELY CONFIDENT
SO RELAXATION TECHNIQUES ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IN THIS REGARD AND PSYCHOLOGISTS WILL WORK WITH ATHLETES TO TRY
AND THAT'S BECAUSE HAVING GOALS THAT ARE REALISTIC RELEVANT SPECIFIC MEASURABLE AND SO FORTH
SUCH AS THOSE BY JAMES MAGNUSSEN OR ROY MCAVOY
THERE'S A NUMBER OF STRATEGIES THAT ATHLETES CAN USE TO BOOST THEIR CONFIDENCE
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THINGS GO WRONG
HERE'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE
IT WAS INCREDIBLY IMPRESSIVE TO WATCH
WE ALL KNOW
BUT AGAIN THE GOOD NEWS IS NOW WE HAVE SCIENTIFIC TOOLS TO INVESTIGATE THIS EQUILIBRIUM
AND THE AIM OF ALL THIS IS TO RAISE A GENERATION OF PEOPLE ABLE TO COME UP WITH NEW IDEAS TO FACE THE
SO LET ME START WITH AN EXAMPLE
AND IT FAILED BECAUSE OF THE GREAT COMPLEXITY OF THE UNDERLYING PHENOMENON
IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE CAN PREDEFINE
AND THEY HAVE THAT LATIN VIBE DON'T THEY
WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE FOR SOCIETY
WE ALL NEED TO LOVE AND BE LOVED IN LIFE
MAYBE SOME OF YOU HAVE
THE SECOND ONE IS BE ACTIVE
PAVE THEM WITH THE FIVE WAYS
THEY ARE THE HAPPIEST PLACE
WE HAVE FOCUSED ON THE WORST CASE SCENARIO
MAYBE SOME PARTS OF THE WORLD DON'T BUT WE HAVE ENOUGH
HE'D BE ASKING US TO REDESIGN OUR NATIONAL ACCOUNTING SYSTEM TO BE BASED UPON
AND THAT'S WHERE I MET DANIEL
HE HAD AN ENERGY AND A LIGHT ABOUT HIM THAT EVERYBODY WANTED TO BE AROUND
HE TOOK IT UPON HIMSELF TO CREATE A HOMEMADE BIRTHDAY CARD FOR ME
THAT SOUNDS SIMPLE
THAT'S OUR AVERAGE BUDGET
WHY WERE PEOPLE STILL ALLOCATING CAPITAL AND MARKETS THAT WERE OBVIOUSLY STILL A BUBBLE
BECOME BETTER INFORMED ABOUT THESE ISSUES AND DRIVE THE MESSAGE FORWARD BECAUSE TO CHANGE THE
AT GENERATION WE CALL THE OTHER TWO THIRDS OF THOSE RESERVES STRANDED ASSETS ASSETS WHOSE ECONOMIC VALUE WILL
NEXT TIME THAT YOU'RE INVESTING YOUR PERSONAL SAVINGS OR YOUR PENSION ASK SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT WHERE THAT CAPITAL IS
GO BACK TO THE MORTGAGE AND FUEL CRISES OF 2008
IN RURAL AFRICAN POPULATIONS THAT ARE NOT CONNECTED TO THE GRID AND EVEN OFTEN UNBANKED

WE DON'T PUBLISH OUR TRACK RECORD ON A REGULAR BASIS BUT OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS OUR OUTCOMES FOR OUR
THIS IS WHAT WE CALL THESE WOMEN IN MY TRIBE IN KENYA
IT SEEMED LIKE SUCH AN UNFAIR AND INACCURATE PORTRAYAL OF A POPULATION OF WOMEN WHO
BUT THEN AS SOON AS YOU GRADUATE COLLEGE IT SEEMS LIKE THIS WHOLE SET OF STANDARDS
BUT FOR THE PROBLEMS WE FACE IN AFRICA WHEN WE ARE LOOKING AT THE MARSHALL PLAN TO REVITALIZE WAR TORN EUROPE IT
TRADITIONAL PRESCRIPTIONS FOR GROWTH IN AFRICA ARE NOT WORKING VERY WELL
THE PAN AFRICAN OPPORTUNITIES OUTWEIGH THE CHALLENGES AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE EXPANDING STAWI'S MARKETS FROM
IN FACT YOU MIGHT EVEN NOTICE SOMETHING TODAY AS A RESULT OF THE LAST 10 MINUTES WE'VE SPENT TOGETHER
GET CURIOUS AND USE IT TO FUEL AN EXPLORATION
BUT THE PROBLEM WITH THIS PROCESS WHICH ACTUALLY WORKS WELL MOST OF THE TIME IS THAT YOUR BRAIN IS ALSO NOT
DON'T JUDGE IT ENGAGE WITH OTHER PEOPLE
WHEN YOU SEE BIAS OR THE ENVIRONMENTS THAT DRIVE IT SAY SOMETHING TALK ABOUT
SO IT SHOWS UP EVERYWHERE
AND WE NAIVELY THOUGHT THAT OUR GENERATION WOULD BE THE ONE TO MAKE GENDER INEQUITY A
ALL OF US MALE AND FEMALE ARE UNCONSCIOUSLY GENDER BIASED
SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE BRAIN PROCESSES THAT DRIVE BY US HOW IT SHOWS UP AND MOST
BUT DESPITE ALL OF MY EFFORT I JUST COULDN'T KEEP THE BALLS IN THE AIR FOR MORE THAN EIGHT
YOU MAY BE ASKING YOURSELF
BUT WHY IS IT HAPPENING
WE HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS AND QUICK
HE WANTED US TO GET OUT OF OUR HOUSES AND INTO OUR CARS AND TRAVEL THOSE LANDS
I WROTE A BOOK
AND THIS WAS GREAT WORK IMPORTANT WORK BEAUTIFUL WORK BUT MY HEART WAS SLOWLY MOVING TOWARD THE ENVIRONMENTAL
HE CALLED IT LAKE FOUL
SO WHAT ONE BOOK WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE
AND INSTEAD I SHOULD HAVE BEEN STUDYING FOR MY ACCOUNTING FINAL I HAD A C IN THAT CLASS I JUST BARELY PASSED IT IN THE END
HE SHOULD HAVE SAID READ THIS BOOK
AND THEN I STARTED READING OTHER AUTHORS DESERT SOUTHWEST WRITERS I READ TERRY TEMPEST WILLIAMS
AND THEN IT'S PART MEMOIR AS I ASK ABBEY NOW DEAD A GHOST MENTOR FOR ME HOW TO LIVE MY
EDWARD ABBEY AND HIS HIDDEN DESERT GRAVE
AND THEN IT FINALLY DAWNED ON ME
AND KEN SLEIGHT TALKED TO ME IN HIS HOUSE IN THE LA SAL MOUNTAINS OF UTAH ABOUT THE DAMMING OF GLEN CANYON
SO THAT'S WHAT I DID
ALL BECAUSE OF READING ONE SINGLE BOOK
THE SEARCH FOR EDWARD ABBEY AND HIS HIDDEN DESERT GRAVE
AND THEN ONCE I RETURNED BACK TO AMERICA I MOVED TO THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST AND WORKED FOR THE NORTHWEST YOUTH CORPS AND
ALL BY CRACKING OPEN ONE SINGLE BOOK
I RESIGNED MY POSITION I MOVED TO NORTHERN VERMONT WHERE I MET MY BEAUTIFUL WIFE SARAH AND I STARTED ALL OVER
THANK YOU SO MUCH
THE REASON I READ IT WAS BECAUSE ABBEY WROTE ABOUT THE DESERT SOUTHWEST THIS LANDSCAPE RIGHT HERE IN
HE KNEW HE WAS DYING BECAUSE HE HAD ESOPHAGEAL VARICES OTHERWISE KNOWN AS INTERNAL BLEEDING
AND THEY DROVE OUT TO SOME GREAT WILD UNKNOWN DESERT
I THINK YOU'LL LOVE IT
MY BEST FRIEND HAUS STILL MY BEST FRIEND AFTER ALL THESE YEARS JOINED ME IN THE DESERT AND WE SPENT TWO NIGHTS
BUT AS WE ENVISIONED IT WE HAD THREE KEY GOALS PROVIDING WORLD CLASS LIFE SUPPORT AMBULANCE SERVICE
ALL SHE NEEDED WAS PERMISSION TO BUILD THREE STEPS TO HER HOUSE FROM GROUND LEVEL MAKING IT EASIER FOR HER TO ENTER AND
WHAT GIVES US THE COURAGE
BECAUSE AS WE LOOK AT THESE CHANGES THAT ARE FACING US AND WE CAN SEE THEM IN CLIMATE
AND IT SET ME IN MOTION FOR WHAT IS NOW ALMOST TWO DECADES OF RESEARCH ABOUT HOW SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION
THEY TALK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME
SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS ARE BEING ACTIVELY PURSUED BY RESEARCHERS AT MY HOME INSTITUTION THE FUTURE OF HUMANITY INSTITUTE
IT WOULD ALSO DEPEND TO SOME EXTENT ON AN ANSWER TO QUESTION ONE SO THAT WE KNOW HOW TO PREVENT INTELLIGENCE
THAT MAKE MICROORGANISMS MORE DIFFICULT TO HANDLE SAFELY THAN A SIMPLE TOXIN
THEY MAY USE SOME OF THE THINGS WE CARE ABOUT OUR RAW MATERIALS AND OUR STUFF TO ACCOMPLISH THEIR ENDS
THAT PARTICLE GETS ITS MASS BY INTERACTING WITH THE HIGGS BOSON
SO LET'S SOLVE THIS OK
IT'S NOT AT ALL THE CASE
WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIND SOMETHING THIS YEAR
WE'VE DEVELOPED METHODS OVER TIME
WE MAKE A WHOLE BUNCH OF THESE THINGS
WE'VE GOT THAT HIGGS BOSON
THERE'S SOMETHING THAT CAN HELP US OUT
THERE'S A KEY HERE
IT'LL BE SOMETHING THAT WILL CHANGE IT
BUT YOU HAVE TO EXPLORE EXPLORE EXPLORE
ANYBODY KNOW HEISENBERG
WHICH ONE OF THESE ENIGMAS HAS ALREADY BEEN SOLVED
THEREFORE IF WE CAN MEASURE THAT PARTICLE VERY CAREFULLY MAYBE WE CAN SOLVE THIS
BUT THAT NEVER STOPPED US
HOW DO WE KNOW THIS
IT'S JUST WHAT WE'RE MADE OUT OF
THAT'S WHAT DRIVES US THAT'S HOW WE SURVIVE
NOW YOUR PROJECT IS IN THE NATION'S PUBLIC EYE
AND IT TOUCHED SOMETHING WITHIN THEM
THAT ALL STARTED WITH A LOCAL TV NEWS CREW COMING TO OUR BOOTH
BY NOW WE KNEW WHAT WE WANTED TO DO
AND WE WERE OVER THE MOON
SO HOW DO YOU BUILD THAT
MOST OF OUR GOVERNMENTS PERPETUATE THIS LIE
IT IS IF WE'RE PAYING OFF THE GREEK DEBT EVERY YEAR IN THE BURDEN OF ILLNESS PRODUCED BY
AND ALSO THE RESILIENCE IN THE BRAIN CAN BE IMPAIRED AND THAT WILL LEAD TO DISORDERS
MODERN NEUROSCIENCE HAS SHOWN THEY WERE RIGHT
SHOULD WE MEET NOW
AND WHAT ABOUT THE WASTE
THAT WILL SAVE MONEY AND TIME
I MEAN WE WENT TO INDIA AND ASKED ABOUT THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM
DECIDE TO GO GET A WEAPON
IT'S CAUSED BY OUR FEARS
WE DON'T HAVE BACKUP WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE NATURAL GAS
SAY WE WANT TO GET TO 100 GIGAWATTS BY 2022
WE WERE THERE WITH MIT AND UC BERKELEY ENGINEERS
I WOULD DO THIS
WELL THEY PROBABLY WOULD KEEP THIS A SECRET UNTIL THEY TURN THE PROTOTYPE DRUG INTO AN ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL
AND WE'RE ABLE FINALLY TO ANSWER THE QUESTION THAT'S BEEN SO PRESSING FOR SO MANY YEARS WHY DO I HAVE
WE SENT IT TO OXFORD ENGLAND WHERE A GROUP OF TALENTED CRYSTALLOGRAPHERS PROVIDED THIS PICTURE WHICH HELPED US
SO WE DID JUST THE OPPOSITE
AND ONE THING I'VE LEARNED IN BOSTON IS THAT YOU PEOPLE WILL DO ANYTHING FOR CANCER AND I LOVE THAT
NOW THE BUSINESS MODEL INVOLVES ALL OF YOU
THIS RESEARCH IS FUNDED BY THE PUBLIC
THE BAR IS CALLED THE MIRACLE OF SCIENCE
YET COMPARATIVELY WE HAVE ABOUT A DOZEN TARGETED MEDICATIONS
SO WE DEVELOPED AN IDEA A RATIONALE THAT PERHAPS IF WE MADE A MOLECULE THAT PREVENTED THE POST IT
WE THOUGHT WE'D JUST SEND IT TO PEOPLE AND SEE HOW THE MOLECULE BEHAVES
LET'S CREATE A WATER SUPPLY THAT USES LOCAL SOURCES AND LEAVES MORE WATER IN THE ENVIRONMENT FOR

I WAS FORTUNATE TO TRAIN WITH DR
LET'S SAY I'M MEETING A FIVE YEAR OLD FOR THE FIRST TIME
OR PRE SYMBOLIC PLAY
WHAT IS HAPPENING IN FIRST PLAY
THERE IS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF POSITIVE SENSORY INPUT
WE WERE TOLD TO EXPECT BETWEEN 300 AND 400 DOLLARS
I KNOW THAT I'VE LIVED THERE
YOU INVITE YOUR FRIENDS ON A WEEKNIGHT AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU A PERCENTAGE OF THEIR SALES TOWARDS YOUR PROJECT
AFTERWARDS MAYBE YOU CAN TELL ME WHY I DIDN'T THINK OF THIS SOONER
AND WE WENT TO WORK
THAT STRETCH IS CLEANER THAN IT'S BEEN IN YEARS
WE MUST ACQUIRE AND PROMOTE A NEW AESTHETIC AND SENTIMENTAL EDUCATION
BUT WHETHER YOU AGREED WITH THE MOVEMENT'S GOALS OR NOT EVERY GATHERING WAS A BEAUTIFUL LESSON IN RAW
THEY HAVE SOMETHING BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS
NOW WAS IT BECAUSE THERE WEREN'T ANY ORANGE BALLOONS
THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THESE EVERY DAY IN OUR ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO DISTINGUISH A GOOD LIFE
BECAUSE THINGS TEND TO GET UGLY WHEN THERE'S ONLY ONE MEANING ONE TRUTH ONLY ANSWERS AND NO QUESTIONS
MANY MEN STRUGGLE WITH WHAT THEIR IDENTITY IS AND THUS RELY ON THESE OUTDATED IDEAS OF
I REACHED OUT TO WHAT WAS NOW MY FORMER PARTNER OF FOUR YEARS AND TOLD THEM
I'VE FOUND MEDICATION WHICH WORKS FOR ME
AND FOR A LONG TIME I VIEWED THEM EXACTLY THAT WAY
AND THAT WAS THE VERY FIRST TIME THAT I FOUND AN OPPORTUNITY TO FEEL THAT I WAS ABLE TO EXPRESS MY OWN VOICE AND THAT'S WHAT'S
SO WHAT THEY ARE ARE JUST PURE LINES
AND WE'LL SEE WHAT WE COME UP WITH
THE SECOND ONE WHICH IS USING THEM AS OBJECTS TO THINK WITH THEIR ARCHITECTURAL OBJECTS I DO A SERIES OF PROVOCATIONS I SAY IF THIS
I'M NOT ASKING THEM TO COPY EXACTLY
I FEEL LIKE I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SAY AND SOMETHING TO SHARE
I'M NOT SURE IF THIS IS GOING TO BE GOOD OR NOT
AND I'M GOING TO IMAGINE THIS YOU CAN DO THIS TOO IF YOU LIKE THAT I'M GOING TO JUST TAKE THE LETTER T AND I'M GOING TO IMAGINE IT IN MIND AND
I SHOULD'VE KNOWN BETTER
AND IF YOU WERE ASKED TO COOK AT THAT EVENT THAT MEANS THAT YOU'VE ARRIVED
AND I FELT GREAT ABOUT THIS
I USED TO PULL MY TRUCK DIRECTLY INTO THE GREENMARKET IN UNION SQUARE TRY DOING THAT TODAY AND YOU'LL GET A LOT OF BAD LOOKS FROM A LOT OF
BUT YOU KNOW I WASN'T DOING IT BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT ORGANIC OR LOCAL FOOD WAS BETTER FOR THE
AND IT'S A QUESTION THAT MICHAEL POLLAN ASKED SOME YEARS AGO AS WELL
YOU PLAY THE KEY ROLE
IN NORMAL LIFE YOU CAN LOSE SOME WEIGHT AND IT'S NOT A PROBLEM
YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO EAT FOR SIX HOURS AND THAT'S A LONG TIME
YOUR HORMONE INSULIN IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT HORMONES TO KEEP YOUR BODY IN A HEALTHY BALANCE
BUT THEN I AM A SKEPTIC
IT BECAME KNOWN AS SIMON'S SHARK SLIME
SUNFISH IS ONE OF THE WORDS FOR BASKING SHARKS
THEY ARE AWESOME CREATURES
NINE AND A HALF THOUSAND KILOMETERS WE NEVER THOUGHT THAT HAPPENED
THERE'S AN UNDERSTANDING WITH YOUR PROFESSOR THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO TO CLASS BUT IF YOU DON'T YOU'LL FAIL
AND IT'S THE FIRST MOVIE THAT GOT US SOME AMOUNT OF ATTENTION FROM THE PORTLAND FILM SCENE
TO PRESENT THE CHILD'S VOICE IN COURT
WHAT COLORED THE WALLS OF YOUR REGRET
TELL HER THE TRUTH HOW YOU LIVED IN SPITE OF CROOKED ODDS
AND ARE YOU A HERO
WE WERE TOLD TO BE SILENT
SOME OF US BORE CHILDREN AND SOME OF US DID NOT AND NONE OF US QUESTIONED WHETHER THAT MADE US REAL OR APPROPRIATE OR
WHAT DID YOU DO FOR WOMEN IN THE YEAR IT WAS TIME
TELL HER SHE WAS BORN AS YOU WERE AS YOUR MOTHERS BEFORE AND THE SISTERS BESIDE THEM IN THE AGE OF
SAY DAUGHTER I STOOD THERE WITH THE MOMENT DRAWN ON MY FACE LIKE A DAGGER AND FLUNG IT BACK AT ITSELF SLICING
THERE WERE STILL LAWS FOR EVERY WAY WE USED OUR PRIVATES WHILE THEY PAWED AT THE SOFT FOLDS OF US GRABBED
WE WERE TRAINED TO DODGE TO WAIT TO COWER AND COVER TO WAIT
TELL HER YOU WERE BRAVE AND ALWAYS ALWAYS IN THE COMPANY OF COURAGE MOSTLY THE DAYS WHEN YOU JUST HAD YOURSELF
SHE WILL NOT CARE ABOUT THE ARC OF YOUR BROW THE WEIGHT OF YOUR CLUTCH
SHE WILL NOT ASK OF YOUR MENTIONS
WERE YOU FEARFUL OR FEARSOME
REMIND THEM THAT THE YEAR HAS PASSED TO BE DOCILE OR SMALL
SOME OF US SAID FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT WE WERE WOMEN TOOK THIS OATH OF SOLIDARITY SERIOUSLY
I LEARNED WHAT IT FELT LIKE TO BE TRULY COLD
SUNDIATA KEITA WAS BORN ABOUT 1235 GROWING UP IN A TIME OF PROFOUND
AND AT ITS PEAK IN THE 15TH AND 16TH CENTURIES THE UNIVERSITY THERE WAS
AND ONE WENT AS FAR AS TO POSIT I DO NOT THINK THAT I AM FAR WRONG IF I
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WE'VE MAPPED AND WE'VE CHARTED AND WE'VE CAPTURED OUR HISTORIES IN WAYS THAT ARE THE
THESE WERE COMMUNITIES WHO'VE GROWN UP WITH STORIES OF THE MALI EMPIRE LIVED IN THE SHADOW OF
AND ALTHOUGH THEY WEREN'T ALWAYS SUCCESSFUL MANY OF THE MOST IMPORTANT MANUSCRIPTS WERE THANKFULLY
THEY KNEW THAT CONTROLLING TERRITORY AND SUBJUGATING THE HEAD OF STATE IT WASN'T ENOUGH
WHY IS GOOGLE THE SEARCH ENGINE OF CHOICE FOR YOU
AND I DON'T THINK ANYONE IN THIS ROOM THINKS THAT WAS A BAD IDEA
THIS IS WHEN WE START TO ARGUE TO FORM SOCIETY
AND MY MESSAGE GOES OUT NOT ONLY TO GOOGLE BUT TO ALL BELIEVERS IN THE FAITH OF CODE AROUND THE WORLD
YOU DON'T SEE A BIG CONSPIRACY AMONG THOSE THINGS
AND THIS IS WHERE IT BECOMES INTERESTING BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE WE BECOME HUMAN
AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST THIRDLY INEVITABLY ONE STUDENT WILL RAISE HER OR HIS HAND AND SAY
HOWEVER GOOGLE DIDN'T SETTLE FOR THAT THIS TIME THEY JUST THOUGHT THAT'S RACIST AND IT'S A BAD SEARCH RESULT AND WE'RE
JPEG OR THE LIKE
LET'S TEACH GOOGLE THAT THAT'S THE FACE OF THE TERRORIST
AND IF NOTHING ELSE TO REMIND US THAT THAT WONDERFULLY SEDUCTIVE IDEA OF THE UNBIASED CLEAN SEARCH RESULT
IT'S NOT TRUE
STRANGELY ENOUGH I ALWAYS GET THE SAME THREE ANSWERS
THERE WAS A PICTURE DISTRIBUTED WIDELY OVER THE INTERNET WHERE HER FACE WAS DISTORTED TO LOOK LIKE A MONKEY
YOU'RE RIGHT YOU'RE WRONG
WE AGREE ON A GLOBAL SCALE WHAT THE ANSWERS ARE TO THESE ISOLATED FACTS
BUT LET ME FIRST ELABORATE JUST A LITTLE BIT ON A BASIC PRINCIPLE BEHIND EACH SEARCH QUERY THAT WE SOMETIMES SEEM TO
SO WHENEVER YOU SET OUT TO GOOGLE SOMETHING START BY ASKING YOURSELF THIS AM I LOOKING FOR AN ISOLATED FACT
GREAT GOOGLE AWAY
WE BELIEVE IN YOU WE DON'T BELIEVE IN YOU
I NEVER PLANNED TO WRITE VIDEO GAMES BUT THESE MOMENTS THAT REALLY CHANGE OUR LIVES THEY OFTEN COME AS THE
WE MADE A VIDEO GAME THAT'S HARD TO PLAY
UNSPEAKABLY HARD AT TIMES BUT IT WAS ALSO PURE HOPE
BUT I'M NOT ALONE
I ADMITTED I HAD A PROBLEM
AND I CHOSE TO LIVE
IT JUST VANISHED
AND I FEEL LIKE YOU CAN DO IT
I UNDERSTAND MYSELF BETTER
EVERY SINGLE SECOND THAT YOU ARE NOT SITTING STILL YOU ARE ACTIVELY IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF YOUR HEART AND
NOW LET ME TELL YOU THAT STORY
I MEAN IF IT HADN'T WORKED FOR ME THERE'S NO WAY I WOULD HAVE BELIEVED IT WAS POSSIBLE
SO EVERYBODY READY
HOW DO YOU GET FROM TRAUMA TO GROWTH
BUT HOW DOES IT WORK
THAT'S ALL IT TAKES
IT GETS STRONGER THE MORE YOU EXERCISE IT
SO IF YOU SPEND THESE SEVEN AND A HALF MINUTES TODAY DOING SOMETHING THAT MAKES YOU
I HAVE CONFIDENCE IN YOU
I KNOW WHO I REALLY AM NOW
I HAVE A NEW SENSE OF MEANING AND PURPOSE IN MY LIFE
PRETTY CLEVER RIGHT
NOW WHY A GAME
YOU WEREN'T GOING TO HAVE THEM ANYWAY
WASTE OF LIFE
I DON'T WANT GAMERS TO REGRET THE TIME THEY SPENT PLAYING TIME THAT I ENCOURAGED THEM TO SPEND
SO TACKLING A TINY CHALLENGE WITHOUT GIVING UP EVEN ONE AS ABSURD AS SNAPPING YOUR FINGERS
YOU SEE THERE'S A MILLION THINGS THAT SEEMS THAT CAN AFFECT OUR MOOD
WHAT'S YOUR NUMBER TODAY
BUT HE NEVER PUT A MOOD NUMBER BELOW 80 AGAIN
AND IT DOES CHANGE THROUGHOUT THE DAY
SO IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE PEOPLE'S LIVES START BY CHANGING PEOPLE'S NUMBERS
HE BECAME ONE OF THE MOST ENERGETIC SCIENCE STUDENTS I HAD ALL YEAR AND AT THE END OF THE YEAR HE TOLD ME SOMETHING THAT FOREVER
YOU'RE GOING TO BE THERE AREN'T YOU
I WAS SICK TO MY STOMACH
AND I WOULDN'T KNOW IT TILL THE END OF THE YEAR
HE TRANSLATED THE ACOUSTIC RADIANCE OF THE WHALE'S VOICE ITS SONG INTO A
THIS PHENOMENON WAS DETECTED BY THE U
HOW DID YOU THINK OF IT
I LIVE BY THAT
I WAS A MISERABLE CHILD A LONELY ISOLATED RUINED CHILD BY THE TIME I WAS SIX YEARS OLD
THEN I FOUND A COLLECTION OF DOROTHY PARKER SHORT STORIES
WILL IT PASS THROUGH ALL OF THEM
YOU'VE GOT TO SEE IT
WE HAD NO MONEY AT ALL
OF SCIENTIFIC BOOKS PUBLISHED EACH YEAR THAT YOU CAN READ
WELL THERE'S TRUST
THEY DIDN'T TELL YOU ANYTHING ABOUT CONSEQUENCES
THAT'S THE COMPLEXITY CONSEQUENCES PROBLEM
THAT PERSON NEEDS TO COMMIT HIMSELF TO THE PROBLEM AND THAT MEANS HE GETS INTO
THEY TOO WERE PRACTICING THE CULT OF THE FIGURES
AND SINCE WE CANNOT CHANGE WE CANNOT SIMPLIFY AND SINCE WE CANNOT SIMPLIFY THUS
THE FACTS WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BREAKFAST YOU HAD THIS MORNING FOR SURE
THERE ARE AT LEAST THREE TYPES AND ONLY ONE IS
YES WE CAN PREDICT HUMAN CONDUCT WITH COMPUTERS
OK I'LL TRUST YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE HIGHER IN THE RANKING
THEN WE CAN SAY NO IT WASN'T ME WHO DECIDED IT WAS THE MATH
AND THAT'S NOT THE FUTURE WE ARE TRYING TO HAVE
AS LUHMANN ARGUED IF THE WORLD IS TOO COMPLEX FOR YOU THEN HAVE SOME PART OF THE COMPLEXITY
WHEN WE TRY TO DETERMINE WHEN WE PICK AN OPTION WE TRY TO DETERMINE WHAT THE WORLD WILL BE LIKE
AND THE LAST POINT IS HUMAN CONDUCT
I ONLY DID THE MATH
THEY CLAIM THAT IT COULD ALL BE SOLVED BY THRESHOLD AN UPPER LIMIT A NUMBER SAYING
WHAT CAN WE KNOW
AND MY MAIN POINT IS THAT THAT STRUCTURE NEEDS TO BE SUFFICIENTLY COMPLEX TO MATCH THE
BUT WHILE WE'RE ABLE TO USE IT WE'RE NEVER ABLE TO ALTER IT
WE CAN USE GRAVITY BUT WE CANNOT CHANGE WHAT GRAVITY IS
WHAT WERE THE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE FIRST 200000
AND WHAT DO THEY TELL YOU
IT WASN'T THAT FUNNY WHEN I WAS STANDING THERE TRUST ME
BUT WHEN I TELL PEOPLE ABOUT THESE APPALLING STATISTICS I'M USUALLY MET WITH AN ASSUMPTION THAT IT'S ABOUT EITHER
THAT WE IS ACTUALLY A REALLY CRUCIAL ASPECT OF JENNIE'S MODEL
THE SOLUTION IS CALLED THE JJ WAY
THEY INVOLVE ELABORATE PHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS MEANT TO PROTECT US THAT WHEN OVERSTIMULATED ACTUALLY MAKE US SICK
I BECAME A DOULA A LAY PERSON TRAINED TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO PEOPLE DURING PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH
IT'S WHAT RESEARCHERS CALL THE IMMIGRANT PARADOX AND IT FURTHER ILLUSTRATES THAT THERE'S SOMETHING IN THE US ENVIRONMENT THAT IS MAKING
REMEMBER THOSE STATISTICS I TOLD YOU THAT BLACK WOMEN ARE MORE LIKELY TO GIVE BIRTH TOO EARLY TO GIVE BIRTH TO LOW BIRTH WEIGHT
WE CAN'T HAVE YOU NOT EATING
NO ONE IS CHASTISED FOR SHOWING UP LATE TO THEIR APPOINTMENTS
WELL YOU'D BE WRONG
THEIR APPROACH IS CASUAL AND FRIENDLY
SHE SEES HER STAFF AS PART OF A TEAM THAT ALONGSIDE THE WOMAN AND HER FAMILY HAS ONE GOAL
BUT BY PROVIDING ACCESSIBLE AND RESPECTFUL PRENATAL CARE JENNIE HAS ACHIEVED SOMETHING REMARKABLE
NO ONE IS TURNED AWAY DUE TO LACK OF FUNDS
AND BECAUSE I'M LATINA AND A SPANISH SPEAKER IN MY FIRST VOLUNTEER DOULA GIG AT A PUBLIC HOSPITAL IN NORTH
NOW LET'S IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT THAT I WAS PREGNANT
THERE'S ALSO A GROWING BODY OF RESEARCH SHOWING THAT PEOPLE WHO EXPERIENCE MORE DISCRIMINATION
EVEN THE THREAT OF DISCRIMINATION LIKE WORRYING YOU MIGHT BE STOPPED BY POLICE WHILE DRIVING YOUR CAR
AS TRINA DEFLATED THE BLOOD PRESSURE CUFF SHE SAID WE'LL SEE ABOUT CHANGING YOUR PRESCRIPTION OK
BUT WHAT I REALLY WANT TO SAY IS
ARE YOU MARRIED TO A JAPANESE
I OFTEN REPLY WITH
SO AT MINUS 271 DEGREES COLDER THAN THE SPACE BETWEEN THE STARS THOSE WIRES CAN TAKE THAT CURRENT
REMEMBER THAT LONG TERM MEMORIES TAKE TIME
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE EVEN GOING TO VARY WITHIN INDIVIDUALS
AND ONE OF OUR MOST POPULAR MANAGERS JOKES THAT THIS IS WHAT HE SAYS GOOGLE IS A PLACE WHERE
IT CREATES A VIBRANT ENERGETIC COMMUNITY WHERE PEOPLE ADMIRE AND RESPECT EACH OTHER
AND HE CALLS THEM LEVEL 5 LEADERS
IN OTHER WORDS COMPASSION IS THE WAY TO GROW LEVEL 5 LEADERS
AND MATTHIEU'S HAPPINESS MEASURE IS OFF THE CHARTS
GOOGLE IS A COMPANY BORN OF IDEALISM
AND SOMETIMES IT GETS BIG ENOUGH TO BECOME OFFICIAL
AND I REALLY WORKED VERY HARD AND WHEN I FINISHED MY PHD I THOUGHT
THAT'S IT NO MORE MOUSE WORK
FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS HUMANS HAVE BEEN DREAMING TO REACH THE STARS AND YET WE HAVE COME AS
THEN I STARTED TO NOTICE A WEIRD PHENOMENON
COULD WE HAVE IT
WE USE OUR PRODUCTS IN NON ENGLISH LANGUAGES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WORK JUST AS WELL
IT'S BOTH ART AND SCIENCE
IT IS AFTER ALL THEIR CONTENT
NETWORKS BROADCAST IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS COMBINED
NOW WHY WOULD WE SPEND SO MUCH TIME ON SOMETHING SO SMALL
NOW THIS WAS A SCENARIO THAT THE TEAM NEVER EVEN TOOK INTO ACCOUNT BEFORE
ONLY 20 PERCENT OF PEOPLE SENT THE MESSAGE TO THEIR FRIEND
YOU CAN BE ANYTHING
THINGS HAD COME TO A HEAD AND I WAS COMPLETELY OVERWHELMED I REACHED OUT AND I CALLED AN EMERGENCY HELPLINE
THEY ALL REACTED EXACTLY THE SAME WAY
ACTING IS A HOBBY NOT A JOB
ANY LAUGHING OR OVATION WOULD ENCOURAGE ME
I COULD FOLLOW THAT LIGHT THAT SHONE INSIDE ME
I WANT TO PERFORM
IT MADE ME REALIZE I COULD DO WHAT I LOVED
JOSH THAT'S A WASTE OF YOUR INTELLECT
THEN WHEN I WAS SIXTEEN MY FAMILY MOVED TO CANADA FROM SOUTH AFRICA
I HAD A FUNNY ACCENT I HAD MY NOSE IN THE BOOKS AND I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE
IT WAS IN THOSE MOMENTS THAT I SPENT WITH MY FELLOW ACTORS IN THE DRAMA CLUB THAT MY PILOT LIGHT BEGAN TO BURN ITS STRONGEST
THIS IS WHAT WE WANT
MANUFACTURING FINANCING DISTRIBUTION REGULATION
AND THAT'S DESIGN THAT MATTERS
SO FIREFLY'S TOTALLY SEALED
SO WE GOT STARTED
JAUNDICE AFFECTS TWO THIRDS OF NEWBORNS AROUND THE WORLD
WE DECIDED WE CAN'T PUT A DO NOT ENTER SIGN NEXT TO THE VENT
I'M GOING TO START WITH AN EXAMPLE FROM SOME WORK THAT WE DID ON NEWBORN HEALTH
I'VE GOT A FRIEND IN INDIA WHO TOLD ME THAT YOU HAVEN'T REALLY TESTED A PIECE OF ELECTRONIC TECHNOLOGY FOR
THE PROBLEM IS WITHOUT TECHNICIANS WITHOUT SPARE PARTS DONATIONS LIKE THIS VERY QUICKLY
SIR WHAT IS YOUR BUSINESS AND WHO IS YOUR CUSTOMER
I GUESS WHAT I WOULD SAY IS FOR US FOR WHAT I WANT TO DO IT'S EITHER TOO SLOW OR IT JUST DOESN'T
IT WON LOTS OF AWARDS
WHO IS OUR CUSTOMER
SO HERE'S AN OVERHEAD WARMER AND A CPAP
IT SOUNDS CRAZY IT SOUNDS DUMB BUT THERE ARE ACTUALLY HOSPITALS WHO WOULD RATHER HAVE NO EQUIPMENT THAN SOMETHING THAT LOOKS CHEAP AND
LAST STORY HERE
ARE WE DESIGNING FOR THE WORLD THAT WE WANT
ARE WE DESIGNING FOR THE WORLD THAT'S COMING WHETHER WE'RE READY OR NOT
MICHAEL FREE AT PATH SAYS YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHO WILL CHOOSE USE AND PAY THE DUES FOR A PRODUCT LIKE THIS
WE PARTNERED WITH A LEADING MEDICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTION HERE IN BOSTON
WE CONDUCTED MONTHS OF USER RESEARCH OVERSEAS TRYING TO THINK LIKE DESIGNERS HUMAN CENTERED DESIGN LET'S FIGURE
THEY WANT BUCK ROGERS THEY DON'T WANT EFFECTIVE
AND HERE'S WHAT WE DEVELOPED
SO HERE'S A PROBLEM
IT'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR MOM TO PUT A BLANKET OVER THE BABY
IT'S NOT THE PAINTING WE WOULD HAVE PAINTED IT'S THE PAINTING THAT WE ACTUALLY PAINTED
I GOT INTO THIS BUSINESS DESIGNING PRODUCTS
SO SIMILARLY WHEN WE THINK ABOUT OUR PARTNER MTTS THEY'VE MADE SOME AMAZING TECHNOLOGIES
I HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO HOW PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO USE A DEVICE
WE TRIED THIS TIME TO GET IT RIGHT
WE PICK THOSE WORDS OUT
IT IS LIKE FOR EXAMPLE
I MEAN WHY WE ARE MAKING SO MUCH FUSS
THESE ARE NOT FANTASIES
WHY DO WE DO IT THIS WAY
BUT DESPITE THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF EFFORT I PUT INTO SUPPORTING JAIME LOVE WAS NOT
AND HE COULDN'T RECONCILE HATING HIS BODY WITH USING IT FOR PLEASURE
AND I ENTERED INTO THAT RELATIONSHIP AS A HETEROSEXUAL ONE WITH A MAN AND THAT IS HOW
HE EVEN LOST INTEREST IN HOBBIES
NOW THERE IS WORK TO DO THERE ARE ROLES TO PLAY
WITHIN 18 SHORT MONTHS MY MARRIAGE FAILED SPECTACULARLY
JAIME STOPPED HAVING FRANK CONVERSATIONS WITH ME EVEN ABOUT MATTERS THAT DEEPLY AFFECTED OUR LIVES LIKE WHETHER OR NOT
JAIME COULDN'T RECONCILE HATING HIS BODY WITH ALLOWING ME TO LOVE IT
HE SAID HE WAS HAPPY BEING A MAN
SO WE WEREN'T HAVING SEX WE WEREN'T TALKING WE WEREN'T EVEN ENJOYING HOBBIES TOGETHER
THE NUMBER OF AMERICANS AND PEOPLE ACROSS THE WORLD WHO ARE IDENTIFYING AS TRANSGENDER HAS INCREASED SHARPLY
AND WHEN I SAW THAT MY SEX LIFE WOULD BE SACRIFICED FOR JAIME'S PRIORITIES THAT
A COUPLE OF THINGS ABOUT MY STORY
HE EVEN TOOK PRIDE IN GROWING A LARGE HIPSTER BEARD
AND THIS WAS BEFORE JAIME WENT ON HORMONES
IT'S THE STORY OF HOW A LOVELY 15 YEAR RELATIONSHIP MET ITS RAPID DEMISE WHEN MY
BUT I WAS SURPRISED TO BE INTRIGUED BY THE CONTOUR OF HER LOWER BACK
YOU WANT ME TO SEE YOU ONLY IN CANDLELIGHT AND TO SQUINT
YOU MOVE OR FACE THE LIGHT AND I SEE YOU
OUR SEX LIFE BEGAN TO SUFFER
THE SECOND THING TO NOTICE
BY THE WAY ANALYSING THE DATA WE SEE A VERY STRONG RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
IT SEEMS THAT THE BASIC EDUCATION SCHOOLING SYSTEM IS NOT PERFORMING AS WELL AS IT SHOULD BE
USING 50 DIFFERENT INDICATORS WE BRING TOGETHER ALL THESE DIFFERENT FACTORS TO CREATE A SCORE FOR A
THAT'S BASIC HUMAN NEEDS
EVERY REGION IS UNDERPERFORMING THERE
AGAIN THAT'S AN INTERESTING FINDING
THAT'S WHAT THE DATA SAYS
INTERNET MOBILE PHONES ETC
BUT WE CAN ACTUALLY DRILL DOWN FURTHER
GDP HAS NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT
BUT IS HAPPINESS REALLY WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A GOOD SOCIETY
IT'S GOOD TO BE HAPPY BUT HAPPINESS IS NOT A COMPLETE MEASURE OF A GOOD SOCIETY
I FELT LIKE I WAS IN A DARK HOLE THAT WAS GETTING WORSE AND WORSE AS EACH DAY WENT BY
TAKE THOSE LEMONS AND MAKE THE MOST KILLER LEMONADE YOU CAN
GIRLS AREN'T ALWAYS NICE TO EACH OTHER WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK OR AT LEAST WE THINK SO WE'RE VERY INSECURE AND WE'RE
I WAS THE GIRL WHO STRUGGLED ACADEMICALLY DUE TO MANY LEARNING DIFFERENCES EVEN THOUGH I WOULD TRY SO
FOR MANY OF US IT'S THE TOUGHEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES
THEY HAVE GREAT GRADES
THIS WILL PASS
FOR SOME GIRLS PUBERTY'S IN THEIR FAVOR
THEY'RE HAPPY AND THEY'LL SHOW IT
THEY HAVE THEIR CLIQUE
PEOPLE REACT TO THESE MIDDLE SCHOOL YEARS IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS
YOU CAN'T AVOID IT
I WAS UNDERMINED AND I WAS MISERABLE ABOUT MYSELF BUT THE ONE THING I DID HAVE WAS AN ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT I HAD
THEY HAVE TROUBLE IN SCHOOL THEY CAN'T FIND THEIR GROUP OF FRIENDS AND THEY GO WITHIN THEIR OWN BUBBLE
AND SOME PEOPLE PLAY IT COOL
THEY HAVE GREAT GRADES AND THAT'S WHAT MATTERS RIGHT
A SONNET IS A 14 LINE POEM AND SHAKESPEARE WROTE OVER
AND OF COURSE HE HAS TO GO
AND THAT'S NOT REALLY A NEW SCIENCE YOU JUST DO A SURVEY AND YOU COLLECT IT MAYBE WITH AN APP
BUT DOES HAVE TO COMMUTE LIKE TWO HOURS PER DAY AND SO ALSO DOES NOT HAVE THAT MUCH MORE TIME TO
IT WAS A MEMBER OF THIS SAME HINDU FUNDAMENTALIST MOVEMENT WHO SHOT DEAD MAHATMA
IT UNDERMINES OUR FIXED TRUTHS AND WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE OUR CULTURE' AND THEIR CULTURE
THEN THEY GOT ME MAPPED
AH YOU'RE A KENYAN ASIAN
A MARKETER'S JOB IS TO SELL PRODUCT OR TO PUSH A BRAND AND THEY DO
IN 1981 THE NEW YORK TIMES PUBLISHED A STUDY THAT SAID TWO CUPS OF COFFEE
WE LIVE IN A FAST PACED WORLD
AND HERE I'LL TELL YOU HOW TO DO THAT
TAKE SEPTEMBER 11TH 2001 IN NEW YORK CITY ONE OF THE WORST TERRORIST ATTACKS OF ALL
WE USED TO BELIEVE THAT BLOODLETTING A
LOOK I GET IT
OFTENTIMES THESE IKA EXPERTS WILL TOUT A SINGLE STUDY AND TRY
ASK HEY DOC WHY DO I NEED THESE ANTIBIOTICS
A DOCTOR PRESCRIBES A TREATMENT OR TELLS YOU NOT TO GO FOR A TREATMENT
SO IT'S YOUR JOB TO BE AWARE OF THIS RESEARCH
KNOW THAT THE BEST FORM OF RESEARCH IS A METAANALYSIS
IT CAN GUIDE US IT CAN PUT ITSELF INTO THE CONTEXT OF THE ENTIRE BODY OF EVIDENCE
DO I EVEN NEED THESE ANTIBIOTICS
SOMETHING WE ALL DRINK EVERY DAY
THAT IS WHAT OUR JOB AS A TRUE EXPERT IS
NOTE THAT NEWER STUDIES ARE NOT NECESSARILY BETTER THAN OLDER STUDIES
YOUR MIND DOES NOT RESPOND WELL TO STRESS
YOU SAY I HAVE A RESPIRATORY VIRUS
LET'S STOP THIS HYPOTHETICAL FOR A SECOND
THE SECOND WAY THAT THEY DO THIS IS THEY DO IT IN MOMENTS WHERE GOOD MEDICINE HAS PROVED
IT'S A COMBINATION OF STUDIES NOT JUST ONE WHICH ALLOWS FOR THE DECREASED LIKELIHOOD OF
ACCESS OUR DATA
I HAD NO IDEA OF WHAT THESE MEDICATIONS WERE EVEN SUPPOSED TO DO
THIS DATA IS APPALLING TO ME
BUT MY EMOTIONAL PAIN WAS AN ABSOLUTE TEN
IN RECOVERY WE OFTEN SAY YOU KEEP WHAT YOU HAVE BY GIVING IT AWAY
BUT MY UNDERSTANDING OF PAIN THAT DAY WAS NOTHING LIKE MY UNDERSTANDING OF PAIN TODAY
ALL I KNEW AT AGE 17 WAS THAT A LOT OF HIGHLY EDUCATED PEOPLE HAD PRESCRIBED ME MEDICATIONS THAT WERE INTENDED TO MAKE ME FEEL
EMOTIONAL PAIN IS TOXIC IT'S PERVASIVE AND SOCIETY HAS PROGRAMMED US TO AVOID IT
BUT NOW IMAGINE SUSTAINING THAT EXACT SAME INJURY ONLY THIS TIME YOUR CLOSE FRIEND WAS SKIING NEXT TO YOU
WITH SHORT TERM PAIN MANAGEMENT MOST WOULD MAKE A FULL RECOVERY
BUT ACHIEVING POST TRAUMATIC GROWTH REQUIRES THAT YOU LEAN INTO THE PAIN
ADDICTION IS THE ONLY DISEASE WHERE WE COMMONLY WAIT UNTIL IT'S AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF ACUITY BEFORE WE TRY TO DO
AND AS ADDICTION ALWAYS DOES OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT DECADE MY TOLERANCE CONTINUED TO BUILD MY LIFE CONTINUED
I'M BETTING YOU CAN POINT TO AN ELEMENT OF UNADDRESSED OR UNRESOLVED EMOTIONAL PAIN IN THAT PERSON
THE ETHICAL DILEMMA IMMEDIATELY BECAME DO I ISSUE THIS PERSON NARCOTICS IN ORDER TO KEEP THEM HAPPY OR DENY THEM AND
EVERY TIME THIS HAPPENS WE'RE BECOMING MORE AND MORE DESENSITIZED
I HAD JUST WALKED INTO THE LIBRARY WITH MY BEST FRIEND IN ORDER TO MEET OTHERS PREPARING TO GO TO LUNCH
I WAS CONFUSED
AS WELL AS LOOKING AT TRANSMITTABLE DISEASES WHICH A LOT OF TIMES WE THINK OF AS BIG DEALS FOR AVIAN
SO THE MANAGEMENT OF THEIR STOCK LIVESTOCK VETERINARY PROFESSION HAS A HUGE IMPACT ON
YOU INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF PRODUCT THAT EACH ANIMAL WILL MAKE SO THE AMOUNT OF
YOU THINK ABOUT IT
SO THIS ALLOWS CHILDREN TO GET FOR SOME OF THEM THEIR ONLY MEAL OF THE DAY
I HAVE TWO DOGS
ARMY MEDICAL SERVICE CORE AND THIS IS WHEN I REALIZED WHAT THE VETERINARY PROFESSION WAS DOING TO MAKE AN
5 BILLION ARE INVOLVED WITH LIVE STOCK
SO FOR SOME PEOPLE ANIMALS ARE THEIR TRACTORS THEY'RE WHAT'S TEARING THE LAND
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT NOW
I WAS WORKING ON THE CRANIAL COLLECTIONS AND IT JUST STRUCK ME AS IRONIC THAT HERE WERE PEOPLE COMING
PEOPLE HAD CLIMBED ONTO CARTS AND WAGONS IN THE STREET
BUT WE'RE NOT PASSIVE WHEN WE WATCH
IT'S NOTHING TO DO WITH ME
AND OF COURSE THAT CROWD IS GROWING ALL THE TIME BECAUSE EVERY WEEK EVERY MONTH MORE PEOPLE WILL
IF WE TAKE A BIGGER LEAP BACK IN HISTORY WE'LL SEE THAT FOR AS LONG AS THERE HAVE BEEN PUBLIC JUDICIAL
GO ON AND JUMP
BUT GUESS WHAT
HOW CAN MEDIA EARN MONEY TO SURVIVE
THE ANSWER IS
THERE IS NOT ONE SINGLE ANSWER
WE ARE JUST HEARING BOMBS DRONES F 16S
AND THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TO YOU TODAY
AND THIS WENT ON FOR ABOUT FOUR WEEKS DURING WHICH THE WORLD AND I AND PERHAPS YOU TOO
IT REMINDS ME OF HOME
BUT HOW LONG ARE WE GOING TO HAVE THAT FOR
SO I'M ELSPETH PENNY
ALL THAT DUST HAS GONE
SO WE SHOULD FIND TENS OF MILLIONS OF GALAXIES
AND WHEN THE VERY FIRST STARS AND GALAXIES SWITCHED ON THEY IONIZED THAT HYDROGEN
OBJECTS MOVING TOWARDS US THEIR LIGHT WAVES ARE COMPRESSED AND THEY APPEAR BLUER
BUT THE VIEW IS VERY DIFFERENT
WE'RE BUILDING THE SQUARE KILOMETRE ARRAY A NEW RADIO TELESCOPE AND IT'S GOING TO BE A THOUSAND TIMES BIGGER THAN THE
HOWEVER THERE'S A NEW RADIO TELESCOPE
IT'S AT THE SAME FREQUENCY AS MY SURVEY BUT IT'S SO FAINT
IT'S A BILLIONTH THE SIZE OF ANY OF THE OBJECTS IN MY SURVEY
OTHERWISE I'M LIMITED IN MY JOURNEY
IT'S POSSIBLE TO DO BETTER
THE SOUND WAVES AS THE AMBULANCE APPROACHED WERE COMPRESSED AND THEY CHANGED HIGHER IN PITCH
THE SAME THING HAPPENS WITH LIGHT
AND WHAT IS TOO SHORT
AND GRADUALLY THE OTHER BOYS DISCOVERED GIRLS TOO
IT WAS SOMETHING IN MY HEART THAT I KNEW
DID YOU GUYS HAVE A SECRET LANGUAGE
RATHER WHEN SMART AUTOS EXCHANGE ELECTRICITY AND INFORMATION THROUGH SMART BUILDINGS WITH SMART GRIDS THEY'RE
SO THE ELECTRIFIED AUTOS MAKE THE AUTO AND ELECTRICITY PROBLEMS EASIER TO SOLVE TOGETHER THAN
NOW IF YOU LIKE ANY OF THOSE OUTCOMES YOU CAN SUPPORT REINVENTING FIRE WITHOUT NEEDING TO LIKE
THE THREE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF A DECENTRALIZED LEGAL SYSTEM ARE
I AM WRITING A BOOK ABOUT HER STORY
IT REALLY WARMS MY HEART
SHE S NOW BEEN RESETTLED WITH HER FAMILY TO SWEDEN AND SHE IS PUTTING IT TOWARDS HER EDUCATION
AND COMPARE THEM TO THE IMMIGRANTS COMING IN THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT
AND ONE OF THE FELLOW SPEAKERS AT THE CONFERENCE LAST YEAR ALEXIS
AND I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT A FLATTENING OF CULTURES RELIGION AND ALL THAT AND LANGUAGES
WE ARE SEEING HEARING WONDERFUL STORIES OF INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS BY LOCAL GREEK
AND NO TIME SINCE WWII HAVE WE HAD SO MANY PEOPLE ON THE RUN
ONE AFTER THE OTHER THESE KIND OF STORIES PRIVATE COMPANIES COMING IN TO PROVIDE FOOD
IT S REALLY HELPING HER TO START HER NEW LIFE
NO OTHER COUNTRY HAS RECEIVED SO MANY REFUGEES BUT A SINGLE STORY A SINGLE STORY
THIS WAS A TRAGIC YET VERY HOPEFUL STORY A STORY THAT HAS INSPIRED SO MANY
I TURNED TO MY FRIEND AND I SAID I CAN'T DO THIS
WHEN I GOT BACK HOME I STARTED TELLING MORE PEOPLE THAT I WAS TRANS AND WHEN I WAS 18 I HAD MY BIG COMING
NOW THIS IS WHERE I COME IN AND TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MYSELF AND WHY I GET ASKED THESE QUESTIONS ALL THE TIME
ON THE WAY BACK HOME AFTER THIS TRIP WE MET TWO ICELANDIC WOMEN ON THE SAME TRAIN TO THE AIRPORT AND AS
I FEEL LIKE PEOPLE EXPECT ME TO CONFORM TO CERTAIN THINGS THAT I HAVE NO INTEREST IN CONFORMING TO
SOMETIMES YOU'LL GET PEOPLE WHO WILL TELL YOU THAT YOU AREN'T THIS OR YOU ARE THIS OR YOU'RE NOT THAT AND YOU'RE
NOW THIS IS WHERE THINGS GOT A BIT TRICKY FOR ME
YOU MIGHT WONDER
BEFORE I TELL YOU THAT I WANT TO GO THROUGH A FEW BASIC CONCEPTS SO THAT WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE
SO GENDER AND THE WAY PEOPLE IDENTIFY THEIR GENDER ARE THEREFORE OFTEN MUCH MORE COMPLEX AND THE REALITY IS MUCH MORE
REAL FAST SHE GOES I AM GOING TO MISS YOU
SENIOR YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL
NOW SHE IS LIKE ME
HELPING A FRIEND HAVE SOMETHING TO PUT ON THEIR APPLICATIONS FOR COLLEGE
IT CAN CUT IT FROM WEEKS TO DAYS
BUT RIGHT NOW IF YOU WANT TO GET INTO THE WHOLE BODY YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO HAVE TO USE A VIRUS
BUT SHE'D GIVEN THE BOYS GIRLS' NAMES AND THE GIRLS BOYS' NAMES
THINGS LIKE WHAT
THERE WERE BIG SIGNS AND THEY WERE LOUD AND THEY WERE MULTIRACIAL
WHERE IS THE OUTCRY ON A DAILY BASIS
AT ONE POINT ONE OF MY FRIENDS SAID TO THE KIDS AND THEY WERE SPEWING RACIAL EPITHETS BEFORE BUSING HAD YOU EVER MET A
SO WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE ALL OF US HERE
SO MY DAD TEAMED UP WITH A REPORTER FROM NEWSDAY ONE OF THE LOCAL PAPERS
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE I SAW NAKED BIGOTRY AND RAW IGNORANCE
AND WE HAVE A SECTION CALLED LIFE INSIDE A WEEKLY COLUMN WRITTEN ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON
PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN TO THEM PEOPLE SMARTER THAN I BEFORE ME AND HOPEFULLY AFTER WILL ADDRESS SOME OF THAT
I BECAME A FINANCIAL ANALYST AND THEN A HEDGE FUND MANAGER
WE NEED TO CREATE A SENSE OF URGENCY AND FOR ME ONE OF THE BEST WAYS OF DOING THAT IS STORIES IS
OUR HISTORY OUR VERY RECENT HISTORY IS FULL OF EXAMPLES WHERE JOURNALISM HAD A POWERFUL IMPACT
THE MARSHALL PROJECT IS A NONPROFIT JOURNALISM ORGANIZATION
THEN THERE WAS JUST SILENCE
THAT'S WHERE THE JOBS WERE AT THE TIME
HE BROUGHT THESE PEOPLE WITH PICKETS
AT THE TIME LONG ISLAND WAS BOOMING BECAUSE ALL THESE WORKING CLASS FAMILIES WERE MOVING FROM THE CITY TO PURSUE THE AMERICAN DREAM OF
BUT GUESS WHAT
THERE WAS A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO DID NOT ENJOY THAT BENEFIT
SO WHY DO WE AS ADULTS RESPOND THIS WAY TO MAGIC
AND THAT IS I THINK A GOOD MAGIC TRICK INSTILLS OR CAN INSTILL A SENSE OF CHILDLIKE WONDER
JERRY ANDRUS SAID THIS BEAUTIFULLY
I'LL PRETEND TO AMAZE YOU YOU PRETEND TO BE AMAZED WE ALL GO HOME HAPPY
IF THE LARGE PORTION OF THE WORLD SEES MAGIC FOR THE FIRST TIME ON TV AND SAYS THIS IS FOR KIDS THOSE KIDS MIGHT GROW UP
BUT I'M NICE ABOUT IT I TELL YOU I'M GOING TO LIE THEN I DO
THE MORE YOU THINK YOU KNOW THE EASIER IT IS FOR ME AS A MAGICIAN TO FOOL YOU
YOU'D OBVIOUSLY SAY NO
WHEN THE CARDS ARE IN ORDER MY THOUGHTS ARE IN ORDER
IT'S MISDIRECTION EVERYONE'S WATCHING THE COIN
THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY ABLE TO SEE WHAT'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM
THE TRICKSTER'S AN IMPORTANT CHARACTER
AND THAT WAS PRETTY LOUD
I REALLY WISH MY GRANDSON WERE HERE TO SEE YOU PERFORM
WE NEED THESE FOR SURVIVAL AND SANITY
IT WASN'T THAT IT WASN'T FOR KIDS IT JUST WASN'T EXCLUSIVELY FOR KIDS
THEY'RE ALSO NOT AFRAID OF BEING WRONG AND NOT KNOWING HOW SOMETHING WORKS RIGHT AWAY
SO OF COURSE THEY'RE GOING TO BE MORE AMUSED MORE AMAZED AND IT'S OK FOR THE KID TO LIKE MAGIC TRICKS
ACTUALLY IT'S THE OPPOSITE
WELL A CHILD DOESN'T HAVE AS MUCH LIFE EXPERIENCE AS I DO
COME ON I LIE FOR A LIVING IT'S MY JOB
TO A PERSON WHO STILL BELIEVES IN SANTA CLAUS OR THE TOOTH FAIRY A WELL EXECUTED CARD TRICK MIGHT NOT BE QUITE AS
IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT SHE IS NOT BY ANY MEANS A VENTRILOQUIST
FIRST OFF THAT PEOPLE THINK THAT THE MORE THEY KNOW THE HARDER THEY ARE TO FOOL
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS
HE HAD THREE RULES OF PREDICTIONS
THEY KNOW WHAT'S IN FRONT OF THEM THEY'LL FOCUS HERE
BUT IMAGINE THE FIRST COIN
I'LL ILLUSTRATE THAT WITH ANOTHER COMMENT WE GET A LOT AND THAT IS BOY I BET IT'S REALLY EASY TO FOOL A DRUNK PERSON
THAT'S THE ASSUMPTION I'M GOING TO WORK UNDER AND TRY TO USE THAT AGAINST YOUR OWN ASSUMPTION
YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAVE OBJECT PERMANENCE
WE'RE DOWN TO ONE
I'LL DO IT VISUALLY
AND YET AS MAGICIANS WE USE THE TERM TO FOOL WHEN IT COMES TO A MAGIC TRICK THAT SUCCESSFULLY WORKS RIGHT
WE LOOK TO SOMEONE THAT SOCIETALLY IS ACCEPTABLE TO FOOL A CHILD
IF I PUT MY HAND OVER THE COIN AND I'D ASK YOU CAN YOU SEE THE COIN
IF YOU THINK ABOUT COMMONPLACE TECHNOLOGY LIKE A HELICOPTER OR A SUBMARINE THINGS WE ALL KNOW RIGHT NOW THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN
CURIOSITY IS THE CATALYST FOR PROGRESS
WHAT WE'LL DO IS USE YOUR IMAGINATION
AS FOR ME AS A MAGICIAN I'M NOT OUT HERE TRYING TO BE THIS WHIMSICAL SILLY LITTLE MAGICIAN TRYING TO GET YOU TO BELIEVE
AND MAYBE HER GRANDSON HAS A PROPENSITY FOR QUANTUM MECHANICS OR AN INTEREST IN HUGH EVERETT'S MULTIPLE WORLD
IT'S LIKE A ZEN THING FOR CARDS
YOU WANT TO SEE HOW THIS WORKS
EVERYONE'S SAYING UP THE SLEEVE
IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE FOR ALL THREE COINS TO DISAPPEAR
I SHOULDN'T BE SHOWING YOU THIS BUT
CARDS PREFER TO BE IN THIS ORDERLY STATE OF TRANQUILITY
BECAUSE WHENEVER I FOUND A GAP IN SERVICES I TRIED TO HELP
WE DISGUISED THE DOMESTIC AND PART TIME NATURE OF THE STAFF BY OFFERING FIXED
OUR PROGRAMMERS REMEMBER ONLY WOMEN INCLUDING GAY AND
I WAS FIVE YEARS OLD CLUTCHING THE HAND OF MY NINE YEAR OLD SISTER AND HAD VERY LITTLE IDEA AS TO
SO THANK GOODNESS THEY CAN'T BE USED TO ENGINEER VIRUSES OR BACTERIA
AND GIVEN THE NATURE OF GENE DRIVES THAT CONVERSATION HAS TO BE GLOBAL
THE RESULT IS BASICALLY A WORD PROCESSOR FOR GENES
HOW DO YOU GET YOUR TRAIT TO SPREAD
IN FACT IT'S WHY WE HAVE AN INVASIVE SPECIES PROBLEM
SO I DECIDED TO START TELLING MY STORY
TALK ABOUT EMPTY CALORIES
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT SO THAT WE CAN HELP SUFFERERS
THEN WE WOULD HAVE FREAK SHOWS NOW WE HAVE REALITY TV
I WAS GOING NOWHERE NEAR THAT PLACE
WHY ARE YOU HERE
BUT YOU ARE A VERY WEAK PERSON
THEY WENT AND SOUGHT HELP IN THE CHURCH THEY TRIED TO DRAG ME ALONG
I WILL NEVER FORGET THE FIRST TIME THAT I EVER TRIED THIS IN A SHOW
6 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE UK THAT SUFFER WITH EATING DISORDERS
A LOT OF PEOPLE DO NOT REALISE THAT THEY ARE SUFFERING AND THAT WAS EXACTLY THE SAME FOR ME
IT WAS A DIFFICULT SHOW TO WRITE
I WILL NEVER LEAVE
SO THIS MENTAL EXPERIENCE OF STRESS ESPECIALLY IF IT'S CHRONIC AND MODERATE TO SEVERE GRADUALLY
A FEW MINUTES IN THE FUTURE WE START LOSING A LOT OF INFLUENCE
THE REASON FOR THE NEGATIVITY BIAS IS THAT OUR ANCESTORS HAD TO PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION TO BAD NEWS
PASSING MENTAL STATES BECOME LASTING NEURAL TRAITS
THE MIND CAN CHANGE THE BRAIN TO CHANGE THE MIND
LIKE ME BACK IN COLLEGE OR ANY ONE OF US TODAY OR OVER THE COURSE OF THIS EVENING WHAT WILL WE DO WITH THE MOST
CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THE PAST
IN FACT THIS IS ABOUT TAKING CONTROL OF THE BRAIN'S STONE AGE BIAS IN THE 21ST CENTURY
BUT THE NEXT MINUTE IS A PHENOMENAL OPPORTUNITY FOR US
IT CREATES A FUNDAMENTAL BOTTLENECK IN THE BRAIN THAT CREATES A WEAKNESS IN BOTH INFORMAL EFFORTS
PARADOXICALLY THE MORE WE TAKE IN THE GOOD WE'RE MORE ABLE TO SEE THE BAD AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT
FOR EXAMPLE TAXICAB DRIVERS IN LONDON AT THE END OF THEIR TRAINING HAVE A THICKER BRAIN IN
YOU KNOW AS WE EVOLVED IN THE SERENGETI EXILE WAS A DEATH SENTENCE
CAUSES HAVE EFFECTS
AND IF WE DON'T GET THE SUPPLIES THAT WE NEED BIT BY BIT IT'S KIND OF LIKE WE'RE LIVING ON A
SHOULD I SAY SOMETHING
I WOULD BE SO HAPPY TO HAVE A BIKE I DO NOT CARE ABOUT COLOR
I LOOKED BACK AND HE WAS POINTING DOWN AT THE SIGN IN MY BASKET
ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE WAS MORE TO MY PATH THAN A BEGINNING AND AN END
THIS WAS 2007 SO FINANCIALLY THINGS FOR A LOT OF FOLKS WEREN'T GOING VERY GOOD
JUST ONE TIME NEXT WEEK LOOK AT THE WEATHER FORECAST CHOOSE THE NICEST DAY OF THE WEEK AND GO FOR A RIDE
ALL OF MY FRIENDS HAVE BIKES AND I CANNOT GO AND FEEL SAD
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A BIKE TO RIDE I DO NOT HAVE ONE TO RIDE
AT THIS POINT YOU'LL HAVE BROKEN BACK INTO THE SPEED OF DISCOVERY
IT WAS VERY QUICK
IT WAS VERY SIMPLE
BUT BACK ON TWO WHEELS AT ABOUT 10 MPH I BROKE BACK INTO THE SPEED OF DISCOVERY AND MY
I KNEW EVERY NOOK AND CRANNY OF THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD
THAT'S A TRICK QUESTION
WITH NO OTHER OPTION I GRABBED MY BICYCLE AND I STARTED PEDALLING
EVERY MEDICATION THAT WE PRESCRIBE OR THAT WE'VE TAKEN OURSELVES OR WE'VE GIVEN
EQUINE VETERINARIANS ALSO KNOW THAT OCCASIONALLY A MARE SOON AFTER
BUT THEY REMINDED ME THAT THE POWER TO SURVIVE AND IN FACT THE POWER TO THRIVE MENTALLY IN A SITUATION LIKE THAT
OF COURSE THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY
YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE BEST VALUE
YOU DON'T WANT TO DRIVE DRUNK YOU DON'T WANT TO DIVE DRUNK
WE NEEDED MORE TIME
WE MISS LOVE
KEEP ON LOVING
I LOVE NIRVANA
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE LIKE THAT
I'M A GOOD TEACHER
GIVE THEM THE FEELING THAT THEY ARE OK
PUT YOUR HAND ON THEIR SHOULDER AND GIVE LOVE
BUT I HAVE THE FEELING THAT THERE IS SOME KIND OF LOVE REDUCTION GOING ON
OPEN YOUR BOOKS
IT'S ABOUT RETELLING THE STORY OF THE POOR AND IT'S ABOUT GIVING OURSELVES AN
SO THAT THIS BELIEF IN EACH OTHER KNOWING THAT WITHOUT A DOUBT AND PRACTICING THAT EVERY DAY IN WHATEVER YOU
THIS IS WHAT JESUS ASKED OF US
AND ALL OVER THE WORLD STILL NEED MONEY TO GROW AND TO DO MORE OF WHAT THEY WANT TO DO OR THEY MIGHT NEED MONEY DURING A HARD MONTH
IN FACT NO ONE WANTED ME TO FEEL BAD FOR THEM AT ALL
I HEARD ABOUT THINGS THAT WERE GOING WRONG IN THE LIVES OF THE POOR
I HEARD ABOUT DISEASE I HEARD ABOUT WAR THEY ALWAYS SEEMED TO BE KIND OF RELATED
BECAUSE THE BEST WAY FOR PEOPLE TO CHANGE THEIR LIVES IS FOR THEM TO HAVE CONTROL AND TO DO THAT IN A WAY THAT THEY BELIEVE IS BEST FOR
HE HAD NO FAMILY TO SUPPORT HIM
ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER BIPOLAR DISORDER
SO THERE'S A RECESSION
I'M NOT GOING TO SEE YOU WASTE A PENNY
NO ONE SAID GET HIM A COACH IN SPEAKING
AND I COLLECTED IT FROM THE AUTOMOTIVE SHOPS IN THE AREA ON MY BICYCLE
SORRY ENTREPRENEURS AREN'T STUDENTS
THAT WAS COOL BECAUSE THEN I HAD RETAIL OUTLETS
THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
WE WENT DOWN TO THE BASEMENT AND I OPENED UP THIS CUPBOARD
REMEMBER I'M NINE YEARS OLD
I OPEN UP CHAPTER EIGHT TALKING ABOUT BUDGETING
IT WAS A SPEAKING EVENT IN FRONT OF GROUPS OF ENTREPRENEURS FROM AROUND THE WORLD
TED TURNER'S GOT IT
IF I COULDN'T SELL ALL FOUR I COULD AT LEAST GET ONE
SO WHO'S STARTING THESE COMPANIES
WE WOULDN'T HAVE THAT STUFF RIGHT
STEVE JOBS HAS IT
SO I KNEW THERE WERE TWO CARS WITH TWO LICENSE PLATES ON EACH
I HAD THE PINNACLES DDHS AND THE REALLY COOL ONES
I CHEATED ON EXAMS
SO I JUST PACKAGED THEM
AND THEN YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO
THEN MY DAD WOULD DRIVE ME ON SATURDAYS TO A SCRAP METAL RECYCLER WHERE I GOT PAID
EVERY YEAR ALL THE MONEY IN THE BANK GOES TO THEIR BROKER
DO YOU KNOW THAT BIPOLAR DISORDER IS NICKNAMED THE CEO DISEASE
AND THEN I'D SELL 50 AT A TIME OF ALL THE CRAPPY ONES
EVERY PROBLEM OUT THERE SOMEBODY HAS THE IDEA FOR
THEY TEACH THEM TO WORK IN CORPORATIONS
GO GET SOME OF THAT
I STOLE ESSAYS
DON'T TRY TO SELL TO THE POOR KIDS THEY DON'T HAVE CASH
I'M LIKE 12 RIGHT
I'M LIKE YOU HAVE TWO CARS AND THEY DON'T HAVE LICENSE PLATE PROTECTORS
I EVEN KNEW AT SEVEN YEARS OLD THAT I COULD GET A FRACTIONAL PERCENT OF A CENT AND PEOPLE WOULD PAY IT BECAUSE IT
AT SEVEN YEARS OLD I FIGURED IT OUT
I PACKAGED THEM UP THREE WAYS
YOU'VE GOT THIS DEMAND OVER HERE THAT HAS MONEY
IT'S LIKE A RECESSION
I SAID BUT YOU'VE GOT TWO CARS
THOSE SOLD FOR TWO DOLLARS EACH
WE FIGURE OUT THE GAME
THAT'S JUST PART OF THE CULTURE THERE
MY BELIEF IS THIS
WE NEED TO RE LOCALIZE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
HOW SECURE IS YOUR FOOD SUPPLY
SO HOW DO WE BREAK AWAY FROM THIS
HOW DO ATMOSPHERES GET THEIR ENERGY FOR ESCAPE
THIS HAS TO PLAY INTO HABITABILITY
THIS CAN'T HAPPEN ON MARS TODAY
AND OF COURSE DISTANCE OF A PLANET FROM THE SUN DETERMINES ITS TEMPERATURE
WE HAVE THE OBSERVATIONS OF THOSE PLANETS BUT WE JUST DON'T KNOW WHICH ONES ARE HABITABLE YET
BUT MAYBE THERE ARE OTHER THINGS WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT
ATMOSPHERE HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO ESCAPE
THE ATMOSPHERE OF MARS TODAY IS TOO THIN AND TOO COLD FOR WATER TO BE STABLE AS A LIQUID
7 MILLION SPECIES
WE'VE LOOKED OTHER PLACES MAYBE NOT AS HARD AS WE SHOULD OR WE COULD BUT WE'VE LOOKED AND HAVEN'T FOUND ANY EARTH IS THE ONLY
AND MANY SOLAR SYSTEM BODIES DON'T HAVE LIQUID WATER AND SO WE DON'T LOOK THERE
THEY PUT SOME MONEY ASIDE TO HAVE AN EMERGENCY EVACUATION FUND
SO WHEN THE MARINES FLY OVER THEY DON'T ACTUALLY SEE WHAT'S GOING ON
IT WAS AGREED AND THINGS WENT WELL
I MEAN THIS IS 100 HUMIDITY THIS IS 100 MILES
THEY DO IT AND IT WORKS FOR THEM EVEN IF IT'S TEMPORARY
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY VERY SCARY
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
WHAT WOULD EVA SAY TO ME IF I APOLOGIZED TO EVA
MY MOTHER IN LAW SAYS THAT I HAVE A ROUND FACE AND THERE IS NO WAY TO MAKE A ROUND FAT
I AM A MAKEUP ARTIST AND THESE ARE REAL WORDS FROM REAL WOMEN
I'M ALSO AN ACTRESS BUT FOR MY PAST 7 YEARS OF DOING MAKEUP I HAVE DISCOVERED WITHIN THE
BUT I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU
IT WASN'T THE BIGGEST LIVE VIDEO THAT WE HAD DONE TO DATE
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THIS FRAMEWORK WITH OUR CONTENT CREATORS THEY INSTANTLY GET IT NO MATTER WHAT BEAT THEY COVER WHAT
BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE MONEY IN THE FIRST PLACE
DID YOU EVER SELL ANYTHING THAT YOU HAD TO BUY BACK
YOU WANT TO SWITCH JOBS OR WORK LESS
ALL OF THIS ACQUISITION OF THE NEXT THING THE NEXT NEW VERSION
ON MAGNETIC ISLAND WE WERE STAYING AT A LITTLE B AMP B AFTER TAKING A FERRY TO GET OUT THERE
SOME OF US BUY CLOTHES SOME OF US BUY GADGETS MOST OF US BUY VACATIONS TO WARM PLACES JUST TO
I WAS AND STILL AM TERRIFIED OF PUBLIC SPEAKING
I HAD 5000 FOLLOWERS ON POLYVORE AND 9000 COMBINED FOLLOWERS ON TUMBLR
SO WHAT DO I DO ON YOUTUBE
I MEAN HE DIDN'T EVEN HESITATE
THEY REALLY BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN SEE WORLD PEACE IN THEIR LIFETIME
AND IMAGINE THAT THAT FUND IS UTILIZED TO INVEST IN GREEN TECHNOLOGIES
BECAUSE IF IT DOESN'T THE CENTRIFUGAL FORCES THAT WILL BE UNLEASHED WILL BE DEMONIC
NOW OF COURSE ATHENIAN DEMOCRACY DIDN'T LAST LONG
IT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE CONFINED AS I WAS SAYING IN MY TALK DEMOCRACY TO THE POLITICAL SPHERE WHILE LEAVING THE ONE
OF COURSE I MADE MISTAKES
IF THERE'S ANY MINISTER OF FINANCE OR OF ANYTHING ELSE FOR THAT MATTER WHO TELLS YOU AFTER SIX MONTHS IN A JOB
AND THAT WILL BE CATASTROPHIC NOT JUST FOR EUROPE BUT FOR THE WHOLE GLOBAL ECONOMY
JOHN STUART MILL WAS PARTICULARLY SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS
TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE COMPLACENCY AND THE CONSTANT DENIAL THAT THERE WAS A MASSIVE AND THERE IS A
AND INDEED LIBERAL DEMOCRACY ONLY SURFACED WHEN IT WAS POSSIBLE TO SEPARATE FULLY THE
ONE PEAK YOU UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW IT YOU RECOGNIZE IT IS THE MOUNTAIN OF DEBTS THAT HAS BEEN
AM I RIGHT IN BELIEVING THAT DEMOCRACY MIGHT BE THE ANSWER
NOW OF COURSE ATHENIAN DEMOCRACY EXCLUDED TOO MANY
OK HAVE I MADE THE POINT
SO THEY WERE THE PRIME THINGS WE WERE DOING
WE'VE GOT TO CHANGE OUR LIFESTYLES WE KNOW THAT
A WHOLE LOT OF VERY WISE PEOPLE WORKING FOR THE FUTURE
SO IF YOU WANT TO CALL US MOTHERHOOD WE'RE PROUD TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH IT
AND THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT
GO ON LOOK AT EACH OTHER
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION
AND POSSIBLY THE COSMOS WE DON'T KNOW
WE DIDN'T WE WERE LUCKY
NOT ONLY IN DISEASE MANAGEMENT BUT ALSO THINGS THAT ALLOWED US TO SEE THINGS ABOUT THE BODY THAT
AND YOUR ENTIRE BODY EVERYTHING YOUR HAIR SKIN BONE NAILS EVERYTHING IS MADE OF COLLAGEN
I GOT THE DATA
I REMEMBER ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES WE WERE LOOKING AT COLLAGEN
AND IT'S A KIND OF ROPE LIKE STRUCTURE THAT TWIRLS AND SWIRLS LIKE THIS
AND MY JOB WAS TO WRITE MANY OF THE ALGORITHMS AND CODE FOR NASA TO DO VIRTUAL SURGERY IN PREPARATION FOR
SO PERFECTLY ORGANIZED A STRUCTURE IT WAS HARD NOT TO ATTRIBUTE DIVINITY TO IT
BECAUSE WE KEPT ON SEEING THIS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BODY
ONE OF THE OPPORTUNITIES I HAD WAS ONE PERSON WAS WORKING ON A REALLY INTERESTING MICROMAGNETIC RESONANCE
HE THOUGHT I WAS MAD ENOUGH ANYWAY
WHERE DID IT GO WRONG
I WAS 28 YEARS OLD
I ALWAYS RUN IT PERFECTLY FINE
WHY DIDN'T I UNDERSTAND
AND THEN I REMEMBER THINKING ABOUT THAT EYE SPECIALIST ASKING ME WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE
HARDLY APPROPRIATE AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME
I WAS BORN IN 1971
I KNOW I CAN DRIVE
AND FOR THE NEXT 11 YEARS I SWORE NOBODY WOULD EVER FIND OUT THAT I COULDN'T SEE BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO BE
THESE TWO COUNTRIES COMPLETELY DIFFERENT POLITICAL MODELS AND COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ECONOMIC MODELS AND YET THEY HAVE THE SAME INCOME
AND SO THEY HAVE TO COME TO THE TABLE AS WELL
WE DON'T PRIORITIZE IT
DO THEY NEED AN ALARM CLOCK TO WAKE UP
WHAT DOES CURIOSITY FEEL LIKE
WE CAN DELIVER THESE TOOLS TO PEOPLES' FINGERTIPS IN THE CONTEXTS THAT MATTER MOST
OR STEP OUT OF IT
BUT IT'S ALSO ALL ABOUT PRACTICE
THIS IS NOT OF CONCERN TO US HERE TODAY BUT IT GOES TO SHOW THAT WRITING DOES SOMETHING TO OUR
AFTER THAT YEAR WAS OVER I WENT BACK TO LONDON TO WRITE UP THE RESULTS OF MY RESEARCH
THAT'S WHEN I FIRST CAME ACROSS THE IDEA THAT I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU TODAY
ON THE FACE OF IT WRITING IS JUST A SIMPLE ACT
IS IT EVEN ONE PERSON JOB
WHY DON'T I SHARE WITH OTHERS
AND HOW TERRIBLE THEIR MISTAKES WERE
MUCH HAS CHANGED MUCH HAS GAINED BUT MUCH HAS BEEN LOST
AND IF WE BREAK IT IF SOMEONE BREAKS IT WE ALL WILL STARVE
IF WE KNOW THAT WE ALSO NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AREN'T A
WE HAVE THE GOALS
I SEE MYSELF AS A DISRUPTOR
AND MY MOTHER AND I WERE IN THE KITCHEN IN OUR HOUSE IN LONDON
AND THEN NO TELEVISION EXPANDED INTO NO PHONES NO CABLE NO MUSIC
YOU JUST HAVE TO BE READY
AND SHE HAD SOME PRACTICAL ADVICE AS WELL BUT SUDDENLY THE MORAL OF HER STORY WAS THAT THE MORE YOU GIVE THE MORE
AND THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO COME HOME ON SEPTEMBER 3RD 1988
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO
I BELIEVE IN CREATING WHAT I WANT
THE WORST AND PROBABLY MOST DIFFICULT DAY IN MY LIFE WAS SEPTEMBER 3RD 1988
SO I DON'T BELIEVE IN COMPETITION
WE'D JUST GOTTEN BACK FROM A WEDDING IN NIGERIA
I WAS RAISED IN A SINGLE PARENT FAMILY WE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH MONEY AND THEREFORE I FOUND IT
MY MOTHER WAS PREGNANT AT THE TIME
EVERYONE IN THE CAR DIED INSTANTLY APART FROM ONE PERSON IN THE BACK SEAT WHERE MY FATHER AND MY BROTHER WERE SITTING
AND THE REASON WHY I SHARE THAT IS BECAUSE I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT SUCCESS IS NEVER REALLY IN A STRAIGHT LINE
THAT'S ALL I REALLY KNEW HOW TO DO
SO EVENTUALLY AFTER EMAILING AND PESTERING CONSTANTLY THEY EVENTUALLY GOT BACK TO ME
SO AFTER DOING THAT FOR A FEW YEARS EVENTUALLY BY PURE CHANCE I HAPPENED TO MEET AN EXECUTIVE AT
SO WHEN I MET HIM HE GAVE ME ABOUT TWO WEEKS TO COME IN FOR A SCREEN TEST AND
I WORKED VERY HARD I GOT STRAIGHT A'S AND I WENT TO OXFORD
AND WE WERE WAITING AND WAITING
AND THEN LATER ON THAT DAY MY MOTHER GOT A PHONE CALL FROM A FAMILY FRIEND IN NIGERIA AND THE
AND DURING THAT TIME THE RECESSION KICKED IN AND I LOST MY JOB
USUALLY WHAT THEY SAY IS IF YOU WANT TO BE SUCCESSFUL YOU NEED TO NETWORK HAVE A BRAND STUDY YOUR COMPETITION
I WAS ABOUT FIVE YEARS OLD
I THOUGHT YOU KNOW WHAT
BUT NOW I REALIZE THAT THERE'S SO MUCH MORE TO THE STORY
SO THIS IS A LESSON AS WELL THAT I HAD LEARNED FROM MY OLDER BROTHER
THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO WORK HARD WHO DON'T NECESSARILY MAKE IT IN THEIR CHOSEN CAREERS
AND SO THAT COULD BE ANYTHING FROM BEING A SPORTS REPORTER TO BEING A POLITICAL REPORTER OR A BUSINESS REPORTER
SO IT TOOK THEM SEVERAL MONTHS TO GET BACK TO ME
IT IS A COMPUTER
WHY DESKTOP COMPUTERS
AND TO DO THIS WE HAD TO BASICALLY COME UP WITH AN EXPERIMENT IN WHICH WE COULD HAVE PEOPLE GENERATE THEIR OWN
WHAT ABOUT IN OUR ACTUAL DAY TO DAY LIFE
SO WHAT WE DO IN OUR RESEARCH IS WE HAVE THEM TAKE A SERIES OF ATTENTION TESTS
SO WE WANTED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PEOPLE HAVE MIND WANDERING
OFTEN IT HAPPENS WITHOUT OUR AWARENESS
OR SOLDIERS AND MARINES WHILE THEY'RE DEPLOYING
AND OUR HUNCH WAS THAT IF YOU PUT PEOPLE IN A VERY STRESSFUL ENVIRONMENT IF YOU DISTRACT THEM WITH
OR WE WANT TO GIVE THE TRAINING TO ACCOUNTANTS DURING TAX SEASON
EVEN THOUGH IT'S QUITE PLAIN TO SEE THAT IT WAS UPSIDE DOWN
OR A SURGEON OR FIREFIGHTER MISSING ANY TIME
WHAT ABOUT IN THE REAL WORLD
BUT THAT'S ALL IN THE CONTEXT OF THESE VERY CONTROLLED LABORATORY SETTINGS
AND WE LAND THERE OFTEN WITHOUT OUR AWARENESS MOST TIMES WITHOUT OUR AWARENESS EVEN IF WE WANT TO BE PAYING ATTENTION
AND UNDER STRESS IT'S EVEN WORSE WE MIND WANDER MORE POWERFULLY AND MORE OFTEN
WELL WE WANT TO FOR EXAMPLE GIVE IT TO STUDENTS RIGHT AROUND FINALS SEASON
IS THERE ANY BENEFIT OF OFFERING THEM MINDFULNESS TRAINING
CAN WE PROTECT AGAINST THE LAPSES IN ATTENTION THAT MIGHT ARISE OVER HIGH STRESS
TO KIND OF BRING IT BACK I'D LIKE TO MAKE A PREDICTION ABOUT YOUR ATTENTION FOR THE REMAINDER OF MY TALK
THEY TELL US THAT ATTENTION IS VERY POWERFUL IN TERMS OF AFFECTING OUR PERCEPTION
AND THINGS LIKE STRESS AND MIND WANDERING DIMINISH ITS POWER
SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE OFFER THEM VERY ACCESSIBLE LOW TIME CONSTRAINTS TO OPTIMIZE THE
AND THOSE ARE ALSO THE MOMENTS IN WHICH WE WANT THEIR ATTENTION TO BE IN PEAK SHAPE SO THEY CAN PERFORM WELL
AND THAT'S INDEED WHAT WE FOUND
DOES IT ACTUALLY GUIDE US WELL
BUT BEFORE I TELL YOU ABOUT WHAT MINDFULNESS TRAINING IS OR THE RESULTS OF THAT STUDY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO
THEY WERE NOT AS REACTIVE
AND IT DOES SO VERY FAST
WE TRACK THEIR ATTENTION AT THE BEGINNING OF SOME KIND OF HIGH STRESS INTERVAL AND THEN TWO MONTHS LATER WE TRACK THEM AGAIN
AND I'M HAPPY TO SAY THE ANSWER IS YES
I GAVE BIRTH
I KNOW THAT IN ORDER FOR MY BODY TO PRODUCE MILK I HAVE TO BE PREGNANT AND GIVE
TELL THE CLOCKS TO STOP
RECENTLY A FRIEND POSED A QUESTION IF THERE WERE A PILL I COULD TAKE THAT WOULD INSTANTLY CURE ME WOULD I TAKE IT
THESE RELATIONSHIPS HAVE GIVEN MY LIFE A MEANING AND A DEPTH AND THEY ALSO HELPED ME NAVIGATE MY LIFE IN THE FACE OF
FORTUNATELY I DID NOT ACTUALLY ENACT THAT GRAVE PROGNOSIS
YOU'RE FRIGHTENING ME' ONE OF THEM SAID AND REBEL AND VAL HEADED BACK INTO THE LIBRARY
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS ILLNESS SAYS I SHOULDN'T BE HERE BUT I AM
LET'S GO OUT ON THE ROOF
YOU NEED TO LEAVE IF YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT' SAID MARDER
IT'S ALSO A VERY INTELLECTUALLY STIMULATING PLACE AND OCCUPYING MY MIND WITH COMPLEX PROBLEMS HAS BEEN
A SOUND CAME OUT OF MY MOUTH THAT I'D NEVER HEARD BEFORE HALF GROAN HALF SCREAM
WE NEED TO INVEST MORE RESOURCES INTO RESEARCH AND TREATMENT OF MENTAL ILLNESS
TELL THEM NOT TO KILL ME
AMERICAN PRISONS AND JAILS ARE FILLED WITH PEOPLE WHO SUFFER FROM SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS AND MANY OF THEM ARE THERE BECAUSE THEY NEVER
BUT SCHIZOPHRENIA PRESENTS ITSELF ACROSS A WIDE ARRAY OF SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS AND THERE ARE PEOPLE WITH THE ILLNESS WHO
SECOND I HAVE MANY CLOSE FAMILY MEMBERS AND FRIENDS WHO KNOW ME AND KNOW MY ILLNESS
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE APPOINTMENT WITH KAPLAN I WENT TO SEE DR
TODAY I'D LIKE TO SAY I'M VERY PRO PSYCHIATRY BUT VERY ANTI FORCE
OH YOU KNOW THE USUAL
ALSO WE MUST STOP CRIMINALIZING MENTAL ILLNESS
TELL THEM NOT TO KILL ME
STEVE BOTH A LAWYER AND A PSYCHOLOGIST HAS TREATED MANY PATIENTS WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS AND TO THIS DAY HE'LL SAY
MY PSYCHOSIS ON THE OTHER HAND IS A WAKING NIGHTMARE IN WHICH MY DEVILS ARE SO TERRIFYING THAT ALL MY ANGELS HAVE ALREADY
THE WALL THAT KEPT ME ELYN PROFESSOR SAKS SEPARATE FROM THAT INSANE WOMAN HOSPITALIZED YEARS
PLEASE CONTINUE TO LET US SEE CHARACTERS IN YOUR MOVIES YOUR PLAYS YOUR COLUMNS WHO SUFFER WITH SEVERE MENTAL
THE POINT IS ON YOUR HEAD
TIME HAS COME
OCCASIONALLY I HAVE HALLUCINATIONS LIKE ONE TIME I TURNED AROUND AND SAW A MAN WITH A RAISED KNIFE
THAT IS AT BEST I WAS EXPECTED TO LIVE IN A BOARD AND CARE AND WORK AT MENIAL JOBS
ONCE THERE SOMEONE I'LL JUST CALL THE DOCTOR' AND HIS WHOLE TEAM OF GOONS SWOOPED DOWN LIFTED ME HIGH
GRAVITY IS PULLING ME DOWN
THEY'RE DIFFERENT FROM ME AND YOU
THERE ARE PEOPLE WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA AND THESE PEOPLE MAY BE YOUR SPOUSE THEY MAY BE YOUR CHILD THEY MAY BE YOUR
HOSPITALS ARE BAD THEY'RE MAD THEY'RE SAD
MARDER A SCHIZOPHRENIA EXPERT WHO WAS FOLLOWING ME FOR MEDICATION SIDE EFFECTS
OFTEN SPEECH AND THINKING BECOME DISORGANIZED TO THE POINT OF INCOHERENCE
SEVERAL YEARS AGO I DECIDED TO WRITE DOWN MY EXPERIENCES AND MY PERSONAL JOURNEY AND I WANT TO SHARE SOME MORE OF THAT
MY HEAD WAS TOO FULL OF NOISE TOO FULL OF ORANGE TREES AND LAW MEMOS I COULD NOT WRITE AND MASS MURDERS
AFTER RETURNING FROM A TRIP TO OXFORD I MARCHED INTO KAPLAN'S OFFICE HEADED STRAIGHT FOR THE CORNER CROUCHED DOWN
THEY MAKE CERTAIN POINTS
I DON'T THINK FORCE IS EFFECTIVE AS TREATMENT AND I THINK USING FORCE IS A TERRIBLE THING TO DO TO ANOTHER PERSON WITH A
ARE YOU ON DRUGS
IT'S BEEN ESTIMATED THAT ONE TO THREE PEOPLE DIE IN RESTRAINTS
AND I AM I THINK FOR THREE REASONS FIRST I'VE HAD EXCELLENT TREATMENT
THIS IS A PLACE THAT NOT ONLY ACCOMMODATES MY NEEDS BUT ACTUALLY EMBRACES THEM
DELUSIONS ARE FIXED AND FALSE BELIEFS THAT AREN'T RESPONSIVE TO EVIDENCE AND HALLUCINATIONS ARE FALSE SENSORY
WHAT HAVE I DONE WRONG
THEY'D SLICE ME UP IN THIN SLICES OR MAKE ME SWALLOW HOT COALS
I'M BEING PUSHED INTO A GRAVE
THE BETTER WE UNDERSTAND THESE ILLNESSES THE BETTER THE TREATMENTS WE CAN PROVIDE AND THE BETTER THE TREATMENTS WE CAN PROVIDE THE MORE WE CAN OFFER
THE SITUATION IS GRAVE' I MOAN
EVENTUALLY I MADE MY WAY BACK TO MY DORM ROOM AND ONCE THERE I COULDN'T SETTLE DOWN
AFTER I GRADUATED FROM THE YALE LAW SCHOOL AND GOT MY FIRST LAW JOB MY NEW HAVEN ANALYST DR
WHO'S WHAT WHAT'S WHO HEAVEN AND HELL
I THINK YOU NEED TO BE IN THE HOSPITAL
EVENTUALLY I CAME TO LOS ANGELES TO TEACH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LAW SCHOOL
HI' I SAID AND THEN I RETURNED TO THE COUCH WHERE I SAT IN SILENCE FOR SEVERAL MOMENTS
ONE MUST STAY AWAY
ONE OF THE REASONS THE DOCTORS GAVE FOR HOSPITALIZING ME AGAINST MY WILL WAS THAT I WAS GRAVELY DISABLED
A MESSAGE TO THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY AND TO THE PRESS ON THE WHOLE YOU'VE DONE A WONDERFUL JOB
I NEVER STRUCK ANYONE
YOU'RE OFFERING TO PUT ME IN HOSPITALS
I FELT THAT IF I COULD MANAGE WITHOUT MEDICATION I COULD PROVE THAT AFTER ALL I WASN'T REALLY MENTALLY ILL IT WAS SOME
EVEN IN THIS STATE WHAT HE ACCURATELY DESCRIBED AS ACUTELY AND FORWARDLY PSYCHOTIC I REFUSED TO TAKE MORE MEDICATION
NO WAY NO DRUGS
I NEVER HARMED ANYONE
THIS IS THE REAL ME' I ANNOUNCED WAVING MY ARMS ABOVE MY HEAD
THEY WOULDN'T EXPERIENCE RESTRAINTS AS WE WOULD
ALL AROUND ME I SENSED EVIL BEINGS POISED WITH DAGGERS
SO THE FOLLOWING EPISODE HAPPENED THE SEVENTH WEEK OF MY FIRST SEMESTER OF MY FIRST YEAR AT YALE LAW SCHOOL
2 BILLION YEARS
HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT SEX TODAY
BUT IF CONDITIONS CHANGE AND BECOME UNFAVORABLE HYDRA WILL ACTUALLY TURN TO SEXUAL REPRODUCTION BY ACTUALLY
IF WE LOOK AT THE ENTIRE 4
AND IT WAS A CREATURE VASTLY DIFFERENT TO OURSELVES
AND IT STILL HAPPENS TODAY
BUT THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT SURVIVING IN YOUR DUAL ROLE AS A CAREER WOMAN AND MOTHER
MY HOPES FOR MY SON ARE THAT BY THEN THE EXPRESSION HER MOTHER'S SON OR MAMA'S BOY WOULD HAVE TAKEN ON A
TRUTH BE TOLD I HAVE NEVER FOUND A ROLE MODEL I COULD TRULY IDENTIFY WITH
WELL WHAT EXACTLY IS RESILIENCE AND HOW DO YOU DEVELOP IT
SHE MOSTLY EXISTS FOR HER FAMILY
NOW I KNOW OF COURSE WE HAVE TO MAKE A LIVING BUT NOBODY IN THIS ROOM THINKS THAT THAT'S THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION
SO WE CREATED A FACTORY SYSTEM CONSISTENT WITH THAT FALSE VIEW OF HUMAN NATURE
JUST WHAT KIND OF HUMAN NATURE DO YOU WANT TO HELP DESIGN
NOW NOTICE THE WORD HERE IS BECOME
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY OF THINGS PROFOUND THOUGH THAT IS
AND IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES THE WAYS OF UNDERSTANDING THAT GET CREATED ARE WAYS OF UNDERSTANDING
THAT WAS THE ONLY REASON ANYONE EVER DID ANYTHING
WHAT'S THE PROCESS BY WHICH THAT'S HAPPENING
LOOK AROUND YOU RIGHT NOW
IT'S A BUNCH OF PEOPLE INTERACTING WITH ONE ANOTHER
SO LET ME START BY DISTINGUISHING TWO KINDS OF QUESTIONS IN THE SCIENCES
LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE THINKING ABOUT HOW TO FIX THE SOCIAL SCIENCES BUT BY LARGE THE WAY THEY
WE DON'T REALLY DO THAT
AND IF WE CAN START MAKING IMPROVEMENTS WE JUST MIGHT FIND THAT AFTER YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS OF EFFORT THAT WE CAN
VIRCHOW ARGUED FOR THE CELL THEORY OF ORGANISMS AND HERE ARE A COUPLE OF THE PRINCIPLES HE PUT FORWARD
ONE MORE POINT ABOUT THIS
SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT WE'RE MADE OF SOME STUFF CALLED PROTOPLASM WHATEVER THAT IS SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT
IMAGINE THE LIVES WE COULD SAVE
QUESTIONS AS WELL
LIKE IMAGINE THAT YOU HAVE A STRAND OF DNA AND SOME ENZYMES OUT OF WHICH A PROTEIN IS BEING BUILT
AND THERE'S MORE
QUESTIONS ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT MECHANISMS OR PROCESSES
BUT WHAT IS IT
WHAT IS MONEY
IT'S A BUNCH OF PEOPLE INTERACTING WITH ONE ANOTHER
WHY DO THE NATURAL SCIENCES SPEND SO MUCH TIME ADDRESSING THESE QUESTIONS
THIS IS THE WORKHORSE OF ECONOMIC THEORY IT'S WHAT MACRO ECONOMISTS SPEND MUCH OF THEIR TIME DOING
THE STAKES ARE HUGE IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES
THESE MODELS ARE SLIGHTLY MORE COMPLICATED IN TERMS OF THEIR BUILDING BLOCKS THAN THE ONES I JUST SHOWED YOU BUT NOT MUCH MORE
QUESTIONS IT'S A REALLY GOOD IDEA TO DO A GOOD JOB ANSWERING WHAT IS IT
WHAT ARE IT'S BUILDING BLOCKS
HOW DOES IT WORK
OR LOOK IN YOUR COMPANY
HERE ARE THE RESULTS
THE EYE IS AN AMAZING STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL DEVICE AND YET IT'S NOT MADE OUT OF CELLS
SUPPOSE YOU WANT TO USE VIRCHOW'S ANSWER TO WHAT IS IT
LET ME TAKE YOU BACK TO THE AUTUMN OF 2008 WHEN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL SYSTEM
QUESTION ABOUT THE BODY WRONG
WHAT'S A COMPANY
IT WAS TOO UNIFORM
AND OF COURSE PHILOSOPHY'S JUST ONE PLACE WHERE THIS NEEDS TO HAPPEN
WHAT IS A COMPANY
IT'S ABOUT MUTUAL FUNDS
IT'S ABOUT ALL THE THINGS WE ALREADY SEE IN THE MARKET TODAY
IT IS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL AND WONDERFUL THINGS ABOUT IT
BY BREAKING OUTSIDE OF OUR FRIENDS LIST WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONNECT WITH SOCIAL GROUPS OF ANY SIZE
EACH TIME THAT I PLAYED I WOULD LEARN A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THEM
BUT THERE IS ANOTHER WAY
IT WAS PERFECT
CAN WE GET THAT
AND THAT'S THE THOUGHT OF HAVING BRAIN DAMAGE
THUS I WOULD HAVE NO CRANIOTOMY NO MOVEMENT OF MY BRAIN AND THIS WOULD ELIMINATE THE RISK OF
90 OF IT FACEBOOK NO FORUMS NO NOT GOOD INFORMATION
AND OF COURSE THIS IMPACTED ME VERY DEEPLY
IT'S HALFWAY BETWEEN LOS ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO
AND HE RELENTED AND ORDERED THE MRI
HOW DID YOU GET THIS JOB
MY SPIRITS ARE TELLING ME I HAVE TO DO IT
WE HUMAN BEINGS TEND TO EXPERIENCE OURSELVES AS SOMETHING SEPARATE FROM THE WHOLE WE CALL THE
SHE HAD THE VERY SAME STORY AS THE MEDIUM OF THE DALAI LAMA
IT'S VERY RIGOROUS
THIS IS A YOUNG WOMAN WHEN SHE WENT TO COLLEGE SHE STARTED HEARING VOICES
THE MONKS STARTED CHANTING AND BEATING THEIR DRUMS
SHE DID IT A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO
AND THIS IS THE WAY I'VE GOT TO FOCUS THAT IN TOTAL DARKNESS
I WAS TOTALLY FREAKED OUT
WHAT DO YOU DO FOR YOUR TRIBE
HOW DID YOU GET INTO THIS
THEY EXPAND THEIR CONSCIOUSNESS
I DID ONE JUST TO SEE WHAT IT WAS ABOUT
NOT ONLY THAT THEY HAVE AN OUTLET FOR THEIR TALENTS
AND I THOUGHT WELL THIS IS KIND OF STRANGE
I WANTED TO FIND SOMEBODY IN THAT PROCESS OF INITIATION
WHEN I GOT THERE I FOUND
SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT BEFORE THE AGE OF 24
SHE WENT TO SEE THE PSYCHIATRIST
SO I SAID WELL HOW DID YOU BECOME THE MEDIUM
THE OTHER RELATIONSHIP THAT I'VE NOTICED IS SO TIGHT IS THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO EACH OTHER
THE WOMAN THAT NEEDS TO GO TO GET THE WATER WILL TAKE HER BABY AND PASS IT TO ANOTHER WOMAN
SO THE ONE AVENUE THAT HE COULD HAVE GOTTEN RELIEF FROM CUT HIM OFF BECAUSE OF THE STIGMA OF HIS
ABOUT TEN MINUTES LATER I FIND THE HOOD RELEASE
SO I KIND OF WANT TO THROW OUT SOME STATISTICS TO YOU THAT ARE KIND OF SCARY FOR ME KIND OF FRIGHTENING
PREVIOUSLY WE SAID LUNG CANCER BREAST CANCER PROSTATE CANCER
MAYBE THE ENGINE IS BROKEN MAYBE THE CARBURETOR FELL OFF OR THE STEERING WHEEL
THESE GUYS ARE TINY LIKE A FRACTION OF A MILLIMETER
THESE CHANGES ARE KNOWN AS MUTATIONS
I TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY BEHAVE HOW THEY FUNCTION THESE CANCER CELLS
THERE IS PROBABLY SOMETHING WRONG BEHIND IT
THIS IS THE IMPORTANT POINT
THESE ARE THE SYMPTOMS WE HAVE GROWTH AND WE HAVE SPREAD OR MOVEMENT
SO MY LABORATORY MAKES VIDEOS OF CANCER CELLS AND WE LOOK AT HOW THEY FUNCTION THESE ARE SORT
AND THAT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WE WORK ON IS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS AS CANCER
HOW DO I PICK WHAT I WANT
THAT'S WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO HERE
WE HAVE A TREATMENT FOR IT
BUT WHAT ABOUT CANCER WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR
SO WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS I AM TALKING ABOUT
HOW DO I KNOW WHICH IS THE RINGLEADER
SO WE CAN UNCOVER THE MOLECULAR MUTATIONS FOR EVERYBODY'S CANCER
I AM RUNNING OUT TRYING TO CATCH A MEETING OR WHATEVER
THEY ARE SMALL YOU CAN'T SEE THEM
THEY ARE A FRACTION OF A MILLIMETER
WE USE MICROSCOPES TO SEE THEM
WE ARE THINKING ABOUT CANCERS ENTIRELY DIFFERENTLY
HOW DO I KNOW WHICH IS THE BAD CANCER CELL
WE HAVE ALL BECOME SO BRAINWASHED TO THINK THAT SUGAR ON A DAILY BASIS IS OKAY
THE HIGHLY PROCESSED CARB FOODS
YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO CONCENTRATE YOU MIGHT KIND OF WANT TO TAKE A NAP OR YOU MIGHT WANT TO EAT MORE SUGAR
80 OF THE TIME KEEP YOUR FOOD IN HEALTHY WHOLESOME CHOICES AND THEN PUT YOUR SUGAR
YOU HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE AND YOU HAVE THE POWER
BUT WE'VE GOT IT SWITCHED RIGHT
ZUCCHINI MUFFIN WHATEVER
INSIDE YOUR PANCREAS IS A SMALL CLUSTER OF CELLS CALLED BETA CELLS
THAT IS HOW IMPORTANT YOUR BETA CELLS ARE YOU WOULD DIE
YOU PROBABLY THOUGHT ABOUT YOUR HEART
AT THE PRICE OF YOUR HEALTH
AND THE FOURTH ONE IS I HAD TO UNDERSTAND THE PATH TO HAPPINESS LIES IN DETACHMENT
AT THE PRICE OF YOUR MIND
AND I WEAR THIS OUTFIT NOT BECAUSE I AM A MASTER IN KUNG FU FAR FROM IT BUT BECAUSE OF WHAT IT
SO I'VE BEEN BACK A FEW MONTHS NOW IN THE UK
WOULDN'T WE BE SHORT CHANGING OURSELVES IF WE DIDN'T PUSH THROUGH
THEN A VOICE GOING PUSH THROUGH PUSH THROUGH PUSH THROUGH PUSH THROUGH
THIS CONCEPT OF MASTERY WHICH WE'RE SOLD TO IN THE WEST WHICH I'M GOING TO GO BACK INTO IN A MINUTE
THEY SHOULD HAVE HAD AT LEAST A DEFINITION
YOU DRINK THE WHOLE BOTTLE YOU'LL PROBABLY FALL OVER
LOW AMOUNTS LOW DOSES OF TOXIC CHEMICALS HAVE THE ABILITY TO INTERFERE WITH THE HUMAN BODY HAVE THE ABILITY
NOT ONE SINGLE STUDY
NOW IT'S AS OUTDATED AS THE MAP THAT CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS REJECTED WHEN HE SET SAIL FOR THE
LET ME EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT
I LEARNED TO ORGANIZE EVENTS
I LEARNED TO BE A COACH AND A MENTOR TO ENTREPRENEURS
HE LEFT AND THE MONKS STARTED TO PONDER THE RABBI'S WORDS
I ALSO LEARNED TO SPEAK IN PUBLIC
AND THIS WOULD LIKELY HAPPEN ONE BY ONE
AND THAT SENSE THAT I HAD WASN'T JUST A SENSE IT'S THE TRUTH
SO I BECAME SO FRUSTRATED AND MY WIFE BECAME FRUSTRATED SO WE DECIDED TO GO START UP OUR OWN
AS PART OF THAT PROMISE WE DO NOT SPEND ANY MONEY ON NORTH AMERICAN SALARIES THAT
BUT AFTER A LITTLE WHILE MY SUBCONSCIOUS DECIDED YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M AS CERTAIN OF THAT AS I WAS OF THE SUCCESS THAT WE'VE HAD WITH DIRECT TELEVISION BROADCASTING
THIS IS JUST SOMETHING WE TRIED IN RATS
THERE'S SOME 3000 PEOPLE A YEAR IN THE UNITED STATES ALONE PERHAPS 10 TIMES THAT NUMBER
THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS TO DO IN THIS LIFE AND IF WE COULD HAVE A SIMULACRUM A DIGITAL
AND SO FOR US THE PROSPECT OF MIND CLONES AND REGENERATED BODIES IS THAT OUR LOVE
AND THEY GAVE ME LIKE A LITTLE PLASTIC ZIPLOC BAG OF A SMALL AMOUNT OF POWDER
SHE WAS A SINGLE FEMALE PARENT
THE REALITY IS A GENDER FLUIDITY THAT CROSSES THE ENTIRE CONTINUUM FROM MALE TO
I WOULD SAY IN SOME WAYS I CHANGE MY GENDER ABOUT AS OFTEN AS I CHANGE MY HAIRSTYLE
ASSUMING YOU STILL NEED MONEY YOU'LL STAY IN THE MORE FLEXIBLE INFORMAL ECONOMY
THESE LAWS ALSO REINFORCE STIGMA AND HATRED AGAINST SEX WORKERS
YOU CAN ASK EXPENSIVE ESCORTS IN NEW YORK CITY BROTHEL WORKERS IN CAMBODIA STREET WORKERS IN SOUTH AFRICA
IMAGINE KNOWING IF YOU'RE BUSTED CARRYING CONDOMS IT'LL BE USED AGAINST YOU
THESE LAWS HAVE POLITICAL SUPPORT PRECISELY BECAUSE THEY TARGET PEOPLE THAT VOTERS DON'T WANT TO SEE
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE AN OPTION FOR SOMEONE WHO'S DESPERATE AND NEEDS MONEY TONIGHT
AND WE FORM PART OF A GLOBAL MOVEMENT DEMANDING DECRIMINALIZATION AND SELF DETERMINATION
BEING CRIMINALIZED LEAVES YOU EXPOSED TO MISTREATMENT BY THE STATE ITSELF
IF PROHIBITION IS THIS HARMFUL YOU MIGHT ASK WHY IS IT SO POPULAR
CRACKDOWNS ON BUYERS DRIVE SELLERS TO TAKE DANGEROUS RISKS AND INTO THE ARMS OF POTENTIALLY ABUSIVE MANAGERS
IF YOU NEED THAT MONEY THE ONLY EFFECT THAT A DROP IN BUSINESS IS GOING HAVE IS TO FORCE YOU TO LOWER YOUR PRICES OR OFFER MORE
FIRSTLY SEX WORK IS AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN A SURVIVAL STRATEGY FOR ALL KINDS OF UNPOPULAR MINORITY GROUPS
IN FACT MANY MIGRANTS HAVE MADE A DECISION OUT OF ECONOMIC NEED TO PLACE THEMSELVES INTO THE HANDS OF PEOPLE
HERE IN THE UK I'M PART OF SEX WORKER LED GROUPS LIKE THE SEX WORKER OPEN UNIVERSITY AND THE ENGLISH COLLECTIVE OF
WHEN FRANCE TEMPORARILY BROUGHT IN THE SWEDISH MODEL TWO YEARS AGO ORDINARY CITIZENS TOOK IT AS A CUE TO START
WOULD YOU PACK CONDOMS TO GO TO WORK
AND SO THE FINES STACK UP AND YOU'RE CAUGHT IN A VICIOUS CYCLE OF SELLING SEX TO PAY THE FINES YOU GOT
AS A FEMINIST I KNOW THAT THE SEX INDUSTRY IS A SITE OF DEEPLY ENTRENCHED SOCIAL
SEX WORKERS ARE REAL PEOPLE
I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT'S NEEDED TO PROTECT OTHER SEX WORKERS FROM THESE THINGS
MAYBE YOU'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THEM TOO
BUT IF YOU'RE FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN OBEYING THE LAW AND FEEDING YOURSELF OR YOUR FAMILY YOU'RE GOING TO DO THE WORK ANYWAY AND
BUT IT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE SAFE WHEN THEY DO THEM
WE AREN'T PERFECTING OUR LIVES
SO THAT WAS SORT OF THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF MY PITY PARTY
WHEN I RECOVERED A LITTLE WHILE LATER I WAS STILL MINUS THE BODY PARTS BUT
WE AREN'T COPYING CELEBRITIES' LIVES
MINE WAS SHAPED BY MY DAD
MY MOM HAD DIED OF CANCER AT 41
LAUGHTER IS SO HEALING
WHEN IT COMES TO MUSIC WE ACTUALLY SEEM TO ENJOY FEELING SAD
WITH A THE GOOD THING ABOUT MUSIC IS IT CAN HELP YOU TO REALLY FEEL YOUR EMOTIONS TO REALLY
SO FOR PEOPLE WITH TENDENCIES TO DEPRESSION OFTEN NEGATIVE EMOTIONS ARE MORE EASILY TRIGGERED IN THEM
BUT IF YOU ALREADY AT THIS CLINICAL LEVELS OF MAJOR DEPRESSION AND THEN YOU MOOD GOES EVEN LOWER
WE THEN PLAY THEM A PIECE OF SAD MUSIC AND THEIR DEPRESSION LEVELS REALLY
WHY IS IT THAT WE SEEM TO ENJOY FEELING SAD WHEN WE ARE LISTENING TO MUSIC
WELL THAT WAS THE QUESTION THAT I SET OUT TO FIND THE ANSWER TO AND ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUES WE'VE
AND WE'VE ALSO DONE EXPERIMENTS WHERE WE'VE ACTUALLY PLAYED SAD MUSIC TO PEOPLE AND THEN MEASURE THE EFFECTS ON
HE WAS SAVING THE WORLD SO I WANTED TO SAVE THE WORLD
LET'S NOT FIGHT IT
YOUR COMPUTER IS GRADING ALL THE EXERCISES
IN FACT I BELIEVE AND I HAVE TWO FAT THUMBS I CAN'T TEXT VERY WELL BUT I'M WILLING TO BET THAT WITH EVOLUTION
THE AAKASH IS 40 DOLLARS
EVERYTHING HAS TO CHANGE
LET'S EMBRACE IT
I MEAN HOW ELSE DO YOU TEACH 150000 STUDENTS
AND THE RESULTS WERE STAGGERING
IN THE MORNING THEY HAD DISCOVERED THE RIGHT ANSWER
WE HAVE TO MOVE FROM BRICKS AND MORTAR SCHOOL BUILDINGS TO DIGITAL DORMITORIES
AND WE'VE ALL SUBMITTED HOMEWORKS AND YOUR GRADES COME BACK TWO WEEKS LATER YOU'VE FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT IT
SO WHY ARE WE FIGHTING IT IN THE CLASSROOM
YOU KNOW FROM HEALTHCARE TO TRANSPORTATION EVERYTHING IS DIFFERENT BUT EDUCATION HASN'T CHANGED
WE REALLY HAVE TO COMPLETELY REIMAGINE IT
EVEN THE INFRASTRUCTURE HAS TO CHANGE
BUT I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT EXERCISE WAS THE BEST THING FOR MY HEART AND I
THE HERO OF THIS STORY IS A GUY NAMED MICAH TRUE
BUT WHO AM I TO JUDGE
I FACE FACEBOOK MORE THAN BOOKS FACE ME HOPING TO BOOK FACE TO FACES
I'M HOLDING MY DAUGHTER OVER A SKYPE CONFERENCE CALL WHILE SHE'S CRYING IN THE CRIB IN THE NEXT ROOM
BUT IT ALSO TAKES A SOFT FRONT THE CAPACITY TO REALLY BE OPEN TO THE WORLD AS IT IS TO HAVE AN
MAY WE ACTUALIZE THAT CAPACITY FOR WOMEN EVERYWHERE
WHAT TO SAY
I LET GO WITH THAT MESS
WE HAVE THREE HOUSEHOLDS THAT SHARE THE SAME GARDEN SPACE
TWO NEGATIVE WORDS
AND THAT IS THAT THEY CONSTANTLY PROMOTED THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL SINGER SHOULD UNDERSTAND THE
AND THIS IS BECAUSE THE POPULARITY OF THE CASTRATO WAS SO VAST THAT EVERY SINGER NO MATTER IF THEY WERE A NON
I THEN BREATHE DEEPLY INTO MY CORE WHICH ALLOWS THE AIR TO COME UP FAST AND FURIOUS FOR MAXIMUM
AND MANY WILL SAY THAT THE REASON FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE VOCAL NODULES IS DOWN TO BAD VOCAL
THE ANSWER IS YES THAT THERE IS A CORE SET OF GENES THAT ARE INVOLVED IN BOTH
TAKE AWAY THE WATER THOSE MEMBRANES FALL APART
THE PLANT ITSELF SENSES DROUGHT
WE ARE GOING TO DO IT
IT'S A BIG CHALLENGE AND WHAT IS OUR RESPONSE TO IT
I KNOW IT'S POSSIBLE
I DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS ANYMORE
CAN WE FIND A WAY TO MAKE THEM FEEL DIFFERENTLY
AND I ALSO WANTED PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THE DEADLY CONSEQUENCES OF US NOT TAKING THESE PROBLEMS
I FELT LIKE THAT
MAYBE THERE ARE MORE OF MY PEOPLE OUT THERE
AND NOT JUST BE OUTRAGED WHEN THE VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE LOOK LIKE OURSELVES
THE US AND THEM THE VILLAINS AND VICTIMS
IN FACT I FOUND SOMETHING TO MY HORROR THAT I RECOGNIZED
CAN WE MAKE OURSELVES CARE ABOUT THEM AND CONSIDER THEM TO BE OUR OWN
INSTEAD OF THE MONSTERS THAT I WAS LOOKING FOR THAT I WAS HOPING TO FIND QUITE FRANKLY BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY
THEY'RE ALSO PROMISING OUR YOUNG PEOPLE THE THINGS THAT THEY CRAVE
I'D HAD ENOUGH
I WAS STARING AT HIM
I WAS TOO AFRAID TO WIPE THE SPIT OFF MY FACE EVEN AS IT WAS MIXING WITH MY TEARS
NOBODY SAID THAT
AND I'M GOING ALL THE WAY
I'M NOT SAYING YOU SHOULD JOIN ME
AND SECOND I GUESS I TRULY WANTED TO KNOW THE ANSWER
IT'S NOT THE SAME ANYMORE BECAUSE THE ROLE CHANGED
AND SOME OF YOU MIGHT SAY
WHAT ABOUT AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE
AND THAT'S A VERY SIGNIFICANT OUTCOME IF YOU KNOW THE HISTORY OF LITERACY ISSUES FOR CHILDREN WHO ARE DEAF
LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE
AND IT DOESN'T WORK ALL OF THE TIME
YOU CAN GET THE WORD OUT
THE FIRST TIME I SAW CUED SPEECH IN ACTION I ASKED THE MOTHER I JUST MET WHY SHE HAD CHOSEN TO CUE
OR YOU CAN TELL SOMEONE ABOUT IT
THEY LOOK ALIKE
WHAT WAS THE KEY
TO OVERCOME THIS CUED SPEECH WAS DEVELOPED BY DR
IT'S A VERY SIMPLE SYSTEM
GEORGE LUCAS HAS SAID ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS THAT STAR WARS DRAWS A LOT OF ITS TEACHINGS FROM EASTERN
IT'S REALLY UP TO YOU
THIS TAUGHT ME THE LESSON OF BEING COMMITTED TO THE TASK AT HAND KEEPING THE MIND HERE AND NOW
EVEN THOUGH WE ONLY SEE THIS BRIEFLY IN THE FILMS WE SEE THAT IS THE REASON FOR HIS FALL TO THE DARK SIDE
IT IS ATTACHMENT AND LOVE THAT BROUGHT ABOUT HIS DOWNFALL
I'M FINE WITH MY INSULIN
THAT'S WHERE THE DISCOVERIES ARE MADE
HE DIED OF THESE COMPLICATIONS AT THE AGE OF 50
WE NEED MORE
WE NOW HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER OF SYMPTOMS AND A HIGH IMPACT ON FUNCTIONING THAT'S REQUIRED
IN 2013 MIDOL TOOK IN 48 MILLION DOLLARS IN SALES REVENUE
WELL I CAN TELL YOU THAT TREATING PMS HAS BECOME A PROFITABLE THRIVING INDUSTRY
THERE'S A GENERAL ASSUMPTION THAT FLUCTUATIONS IN REPRODUCTIVE HORMONES CAUSE EXTREME
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I MEAN BY ERRONEOUSLY
OH THAT'S NOT WHO SHE IS
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES REAP UNTOLD PROFITS WHEN WOMEN ARE CONVINCED THEY SHOULD TAKE A PRESCRIBED
WHEN WOMEN ARE PRESCRIBED DRUGS LIKE ANTI DEPRESSANTS OR HORMONES MEDICAL PROTOCOL REQUIRES THAT
IT'S OUT OF HER CONTROL
THE MEDICAL FIELD HAS A LONG HISTORY OF CONCEPTUALIZING WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE PROCESSES AS
SO WE HAVE NOT HAD THAT AT ALL WITH THESE SO CALLED TREATMENTS
HOWEVER THE FINANCIAL GAIN OF PERPETUATING THE MYTH THAT PMS IS A COMMON
AND FINALLY THE DSM REQUIRED THAT THE EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE SHOULD BE MORE THAN SIMPLY AN
HOWEVER AFTER FIVE DECADES OF RESEARCH THERE'S NO STRONG CONSENSUS ON THE
AS MOST COMMONLY DEFINED BY PSYCHOLOGISTS PMS INVOLVES NEGATIVE BEHAVIORAL
WE KNOW THERE'S A STRONG CULTURAL COMPONENT TO THE BELIEF IN PMS BECAUSE IT'S NEARLY UNHEARD OF OUTSIDE OF
THAT IS WHAT I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU
MAYBE IN THE ANIMALS MAYBE IN THE HUMANS SOMEWHERE YOU WILL BE REBORN
THAT IS THE MAIN POINT
KARMIC DREAM IS ALWAYS IT IS THE NEGATIVE SIDE
THEN I GOT MYSELF A PIANO
SO WE ALL HAVE TO WORK AND GENERATE MONEY IN ORDER TO GET SORTED ABOUT OUR BASIC NEEDS WHICH
SO I WAS ON TOP OF THE WORLD I WAS FEAR FREE AND RICH AND I CAN FINALLY EXPLORE ALL MY
WHY SHOULD I PAY TO GET A PLACE TO LIVE ON
I MEAN WE ARE THE ONES RUNNING THIS PLACE SO WE CAN DO ANYTHING
SO I LEAVE YOU TONIGHT WITH AN INVITATION
I'D WALK IN THE MOUNTAINS EVERY SECOND DAY
I WENT TRAVELLING
SO I DID IT
I COACH THEM SO THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND THEY CAN COMPETE AND THEN WE CELEBRATE WHAT THEY DO CORRECT EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T EXPECT
IN GOVERNMENT WE ALSO HAVE TO HAVE A SENSE OF URGENCY AND WE AS CUSTOMERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO
SO I'M SURE THAT YOU HAVE ARRIVED BY NOW AT THE SAME SOLUTION I DID A TIME AGO AND THAT IS IS THAT WE NEED AN ELECTRICAL
THEN LATER WHEN ELECTRICAL DEMAND INCREASES YOU CAN FLOW THAT WATER OVER THAT DAM THROUGH THE GENERATORS AND PRODUCE
WHILE IN UNDERGRAD AT KENT STATE I FOUND MY PASSION FOR BOTH CHEMISTRY AND THE ENERGY INDUSTRY AND IT WAS THROUGH THESE TWO
MAYBE THEY CAN
THOSE GIRLS ARE REALLY NICE
I MADE A PROJECT FOR TED
WE CAN SWITCH THEM OFF
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA OF WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO WITH THAT XBOX
SO IN SUMMER 2000 I WAS THE FIRST TO BASE JUMP THE EIGER NORTH FACE IN SWITZERLAND
THAT'S REASON NUMBER ONE
UE USUALLY I'M WEARING A HELMET
THEY CAN'T REPRODUCE IN THE WILD ANYMORE
THERE ARE SOME GENERAL OBSERVATIONS WE CAN MAKE
THE TOMATO THAT'S SHOWN HERE LACKS THE TOMATINE AND SOLANINE TOXINS THAT ARE PRESENT IN ITS WILD
AND AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THIS THING GETS SO OUT OF BALANCE WE CAN EAT SO MANY MORE
WE SEE EVIDENCE OF HARVESTING OF BONE MARROW IN FAUNAL ASSEMBLES WHERE YOU SEE CHARACTERISTIC CUTTING OPEN OF THE BONES LIKE YOU
SO EVERY BANANA YOU'VE EVER EATEN IS A GENETIC CLONE OF EVERY OTHER BANANA GROWN FROM CUTTINGS
NOW UNFORTUNATELY IN AMERICAN DIETS TODAY THE TREND IS GOING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
IT'S VERY INTERESTING
IT'S SUCH A STRANGE LOOKING VEGETABLE
WE'RE LOSING ALL OF THIS BALANCE
FINALLY THE PLANTS YOU'D EAT WOULD STILL CONTAIN A LOT OF TOXINS AT VARIOUS LEVELS AND PHYTOCHEMICALS SOME OF WHICH
ONE IS THAT THEY ARE REGIONALLY VARIABLE
THEY LAY EGGS ALMOST EVERY SINGLE DAY
THAT'S AN AWFUL LOT OF SUGAR
AND THAT ARIDITY CAN ALSO HAVE AN IMPACT
WE HAVE A LONGER DIGESTIVE TRACT THAN CARNIVORES
WE NEED MORE SURFACE AREA WE NEED MORE MICROBES
WE DO NOT HAVE CARNASSIALS WHICH ARE THE SPECIALISED TEETH THAT CARNIVORES HAVE TO SHRED MEAT
5 FEET OF SUGAR CANE TO REACH THAT LEVEL
WILLIAMS AT UC HASTINGS REPORTED FACING RACIALIZED GENDER BIAS
5 BILLION DOLLAR GALILEO MISSION TO JUPITER TWO HIGH PROFILE SCIENTIFIC
SO THAT'S IT AND WE HOPE TO DO THIS IN A BIG WAY
YOU'VE GOT TO TRY IT ON YOUR OWN TO BELIEVE IT
CAN WE MAKE A LITTLE PRODUCT OR A SERVICE OUT OF IT
WE WENT AND SCAVENGED THE NEARBY MARKETS AND WE TRIED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT CAN WE PICK UP THAT WILL MAKE THIS HAPPEN
THERE WAS A LITTLE GUY WITH WHITE HAIR
SHE'D TOLD ME BEFORE WHY DON'T YOU TRY THERAPY
BUT YOU KNOW I FOUND OUT LATER THAT EVENING
WHEN YOU HAVE THIS TRAUMA IT'S LIKE A SOLDIER WITH POST TRAUMATIC STRESS
I WAS LIKE FORGET ABOUT IT
FIRST WEEK I WAS THERE I WENT TO SOME PARTY
FINALLY I GOT A FULBRIGHT SHOLARSHIP TO MIT WHICH IS THE REASON I AM STANDING HERE
SO ME AND MY BUDDY WHO WAS MY SPARRING PARTNER GOT HIRED TO DO SOME SPECIAL WORK AT A ROCK
A THOUGHTFUL EXPRESSION
WE CAN REMEMBER FACTS WE CAN REMEMBER ABSTRACT CONCEPT EVEN WHOLE TOPICS WITH
SO WE HAVE TO START GETTING USED TO THINKING IN PICTURES
WORKIN' MOMS IS THAT FOR ME
YOU'RE NOT SMART ENOUGH
I SAY THAT BECAUSE I HAD POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION
I DON'T WANT TO DOWNPLAY THAT
AND THEY SHOULD BE APPLAUDED AND WE NEED MORE OF THEM
QUESTIONING THE NORM
THIS ROOM BY THE VERY NATURE OF THIS EVENT IS CLEARLY FULL OF INDEPENDENT THINKERS
AND SOME PROJECTS HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN BROUGHT TO MARKET THROUGH THIS PROCESS FAMOUSLY GMAIL
THIS IS MOVING VERY FAST
OR ULTIMATELY IS TECHNOLOGY THE POINT
ARE WE MEANT TO CONFORM TO TECHNOLOGY
HAITI WAS SOMETHING WE HADN'T SEEN BEFORE
OUT OF THIS RUBBLE OF HAITI AND FROM THIS DEVASTATION CAME SOMETHING THAT WE CALL TERA THE TRILOGY
IN MONGOLIA FOR INSTANCE WHERE 30 PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE ARE NOMADIC SMS INFORMATION SYSTEMS ARE
AND THOUGH AT THE TIME HE FELT STUPID AND DUMB FOR TRYING TO LOVE A GIRL CONTROLLED BY HER STUPID MUM HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN COMFORTED BY THE SIMPLE SUM
I MEAN THIS GIRL WAS WICKED SO HE PLUCKED UP THE COURAGE AND ASKED FOR HER DIGITS
TAKES JUST UNDER A MINUTE TO WORK OUT THAT IT S BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT HE SLEPT
HE RECKONED SHE WOULD LIKE HIM IF SHE KNEW HE WAS LIKE HER AND IT WAS DIFFERENT THIS TIME
BUT I WOULDN T WANNA DEAL WITH ALL THE PAPER PEOPLE POLITICS
AND WHAT IT ALSO MEANS IS YOU CAN WIN
MAYBE POP UP PURPLE PAPER PEOPLE
WHILE SHE MAINTAINED THE STRICT VIEWS IMPOSED ON HER BY HER MOTHER THAT SEPARATE COULD NOT BE EQUAL
THERE D BE A POMPOUS PAPER PARLIAMENT WHO REMAINED OUT OF TOUCH AND WHO IGNORED THE PEOPLE'S PROTESTS ABOUT ALL THE PAPER CUTS THEN
WE ARE IN A WORLD WHERE MOST AMERICAN CITIZENS OVER THE AGE OF 12
SO THEY WENT FOR PLAN B
SOME OF THE STUFF WE SHARE IS STUFF WE'VE FOUND
AND THE MAIN REASON IT HASN'T WORKED IS THE INTERNET HAS TURNED OUT TO BE FAR MORE POPULAR AND FAR MORE POWERFUL THAN
IT'S FROM THE SENATE
AND THIS FREAKED THE MEDIA BUSINESSES OUT IT FREAKED THEM OUT EVERY TIME
SO WHEN THE AUDIO HOME RECORDING ACT OF 1992 WAS PASSED THE MEDIA BUSINESSES GAVE UP
THESE ARE THE FOUR WAYS TO GO
I THINK MOST PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO BE DEAD
THIS HAS BEEN A RIDE MAN THIS HAS BEEN FANTASTIC
AND INTENSIVE CARE HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THAT
IN THE US IT'S 1 IN 5
SO I STAYED UP AT NIGHT AND TALKED TO MY HUSBAND HOW DO I GIVE PRESIDENT OBAMA A PERIODIC TABLE
SO THIS IS A VIRUS BASED SOLAR CELL
NOW YOU'RE IN YOUR ELEMENT
AND YOU FLIP IT OVER AND IT'S THE AMINO ACIDS WITH THE PH AT WHICH THEY HAVE DIFFERENT CHARGES
AND SO I GIVE THIS OUT TO THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
A TEN MINUTE WALK TOOK ME AN HOUR AND A HALF
CLIMBING UP THE STAIRS TO MY HOUSE 20 MINUTES
SO THEY LINK PAIN TO PLEASURE
HE TRAINED HE WORKED OUT HE WAS DISCIPLINED
I'VE CHOSEN TO HAVE A STRAIGHT ARM
I JUST WISH I COULD HAVE A WEEK OFF AT HOME LOUNGING AROUND
I MUST HAVE MY ARM STRAIGHT
SO I SAID YES OF COURSE I COULD DO THAT
HE DIDN'T JUST GO YEAH I'M THE GREATEST ME
I TOLD MYSELF I WAS THE GREATEST BEFORE I EVEN WAS
I CAN TAKE THE PAIN I WANT THE PAIN
YOU SEE THE RIGHT THINGS YOU TELL YOURSELF THE RIGHT WORDS
AT THE END HE SAID I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DID THAT BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE GIVE UP HALFWAY
I TOLD MY BRAIN I WANTED IT
I KEPT SAYING I WANT IT
WE'RE NOT THE FIRST ONES TO COME UP WITH A MOBILE POLLING PLACE
SO IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE IN THE COUNTY WE ARE OR WHERE IN THE COUNTY THE VOTER IS FROM WE CAN
HERE WE ARE IN DOWNTOWN BOISE
BUT THAT WAS JUST DAYS AFTER WE'D SET UP ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD IN A SMALL RURAL TOWN AND CAUGHT
BY GOING MOBILE WE WERE ABLE TO MAKE VOTING MORE AVAILABLE TO MORE PEOPLE IN
BUT WHAT WE'VE DONE IS SIMPLIFY THE DESIGN IN A WAY THAT MAKES IT AFFORDABLE TO IMPLEMENT
THAT MEANS WE CAN PULL UP TO AN EMPTY PARKING LOT OR PULL UP TO A STREET CORNER AND IN 20
THIS ALLOW US TO SECURELY PRINT EACH VOTER'S BALLOT AND ENSURE THEY HAVE THE RIGHT CONTENTS
SO FROM THERE OUR EMERGENCY BACKUP PLAN EVOLVED INTO FOOD TRUCK VOTING
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER YOU ARE IN AN URBAN OR RURAL ENVIRONMENT FOOD TRUCK VOTING CAN
WE SHOULDN'T LET OUR BUSY LIVES OR INCONVENIENCE STAND IN OUR WAY
ONCE THE VOTER HAS THEIR BALLOT VOTING IS SIMPLE
IT WAS IN THAT MOMENT THAT WE REALIZED WE NEEDED TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND IN AN EMERGENCY
HENCE A MOBILE POLLING PLACE
THE KEY TO FOOT TRUCK VOTING IS THE SIMPLICITY OF THE DESIGN
WELL ACCORDING TO MULTIPLE STUDIES BY THE U
BUT BEFORE I DO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE NO ONE IS CONFUSED I AM HERE TO TALK ABOUT BALLOTS
IT'S SOMETHING WE ROLLED OUT IN THE ELECTION'S OFFICE HERE IN ADA COUNTY IN IDAHO AS PART OF EARLY VOTING
INSTEAD OF HAVING A RAMP OR A WHEELCHAIR LIFT BY KEEPING VOTING OUT ON THE SIDEWALK UNDERNEATH THE
I'LL JUST DRIVE NO STOP
MAYBE I CAN FIND SOMETHING THERE
IT WAS SO EASY TO DO
THE NEXT PROJECT I WANT TO SHOW WAS GIVEN TO ME IN AN EMAIL FROM A STRANGER
AND WE'RE NEVER GIVEN A REASON WHY WE SHOULD PLAY
SO IT SEEMED LIKE MAYBE SHE HAD BEEN DARED TO DO THIS
AND YOU KNOW NOT EVERYBODY'S GOING TO LIKE EVERYTHING YOU DO AND I'VE CERTAINLY DEVELOPED A THICK SKIN THANKS TO INTERNET COMMENTS BUT
AND THEY CAUGHT A COUPLE OF MY GUYS WHO HAD HIDDEN CAMERAS IN DUFFEL BAGS
ONE THING THE MANAGERS WERE TRYING TO DO WAS TO TRACK DOWN OUR CAMERAS
IT'S JUST ACCEPTABLE THAT PLAY IS A GOOD THING
WE DON'T NEED A REASON
SO I GOT INSPIRED BY THAT
IT'S A PRANK BUT IT'S A PRANK THAT GIVES SOMEBODY A GREAT STORY TO TELL
AND HER REACTION INSPIRED ME TO DO A SECOND ANNUAL NO PANTS SUBWAY RIDE
AND WE'VE CONTINUED TO DO IT EVERY YEAR
HE THOUGHT NATURE WOULD PROTECT US FROM THEIR FORMATION
IT WAS DECADES BEFORE THE TERM BLACK HOLE WAS COINED AND PEOPLE REALIZED THAT BLACK HOLES ARE REAL
IT'LL BRING US THAT MUCH CLOSER TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE BIG BANG WHICH BRINGS US THAT MUCH CLOSER TO
THIS GIRL IS BECOMING A PRINCESS TODAY AND THAT'S PART OF THE EXCITEMENT
EVER SINCE MS
HOWLAND STARTED HER BUSINESS CAPITALISM AND ROMANCE HAVE BEEN IN BED TOGETHER
CAPITALISM AND ROMANCE WORKED TOGETHER LIKE A WELL OILED MACHINE
MOST OF THE FINGERS THAT ARE DRUNK ARE DIALING ABOUT IT
A LIFE WITHOUT IT
ALL MY BEST WISHES
MOST OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN IT ARE SMILING ABOUT IT
SO I ASK YOU HAS THAT NUMBER THAT YOU HAD IN YOUR HEAD AT THE BEGINNING HAS THAT CHANGED
AND THE WHOLE STUDENT BODY WOULD VOTE ON WHERE TO HAVE THE PARTY
EVERYTHING THAT YOU FEEL IS SURREAL ABOUT IT
JUST LIKE I AM NOT GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT LANGUAGE I'M GOING TO BE SPEAKING
AND FOR THE REST OF OUR TIME I'M GOING TO SPEAK IN ONE LANGUAGE THAT IS NATIVE TO
FOLLOW WITH ME AS I GO THROUGH THESE LETTERS
NO RESPONSE NECESSARY
IT WAS AROUND THIS TIME THAT EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T NECESSARILY FEEL ALL THAT DIFFERENT FROM MY PEERS OTHER
A DOZEN WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE BUT
I BLAME YOU
I'M TOO TIRED
INSTEAD OF EXPENDING HIS CREATIVE ENERGY TO CHANGE HIMSELF AND TO COVER AND TO MEET THE STANDARDS THAT SOCIETY WANTED
THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE
UNFORTUNATELY IN 2011 WHEN I WAS GRADUATING IN 2010 WHEN YOU SEARCHED GEORGETOWN
THAT WAS REAL TAPE
BECAUSE STONEWALL WAS ONE OF THE FIRST INSTANCES IN AMERICAN HISTORY WHERE THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY SAID WE WILL
BECAUSE I WAS ABLE TO DEVELOP THE VOCABULARY I STARTED TO SEE WHAT IT WAS THAT MADE ME DIFFERENT THAN
WHY WOULD I BE OUT AND EVEN IF I HAD ALL THIS HISTORY WHAT GOOD WAS THAT
SO I'VE HEARD
NOW OBVIOUSLY I WAS ONLY A SMALL PART OF THIS WORK BUT PART OF VISIBILITY PART OF GEORGETOWN
VERY VERY DIFFERENT THAN ALBUQUERQUE
WHAT GOOD WAS IT DOING IF I COULD STILL HIDE AWAY
AND SO I UNDERSTOOD THAT BEING OUT WAS NOT IMPORTANT JUST FOR MYSELF IT WAS NOT IMPORTANT JUST BECAUSE OF THE DEBT THAT I OWED TO
IN ITS PUREST FORM WHAT PRIDE AND WHAT THESE STUDENTS WERE DOING WAS SAYING I AM HERE FOR ME
WHERE WAS I GOING TO GO TO COLLEGE AFTER BRONX SCIENCE
WE WOULD RATHER OWN OURSELVES AND USE OUR IDENTITIES TO CHANGE THE SYSTEMS AROUND US
SO THAT'S WHAT SHE FOCUSED ON
WHY WOULD I FIGHT
BUT THAT WASN'T QUITE YET ENOUGH FOR ME TO OWN MY OWN IDENTITY
I HAD TO START WORKING AT A METH LAB
I USE MY CREATIVE ENERGIES TO BEND THE INSTITUTION TO ACCEPT PEOPLE TO ACCEPT IDENTITIES
BUSH WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN AS AMENABLE TO THE PROJECT ABOUT HOW METH AND GAY SEX COULD CHANGE THE WORLD
I CAN'T DEAL WITH THAT AGAIN
THOSE WERE REALLY BROKEN GLASSES
GEORGETOWN BY PERFORMING THE FIRST EVER DRAG ROUTINE IN GASTON HALL I THINK UNLESS THE JUDGE
NOW WE'VE RESTARTED THE COLORS
THIS WAS THE OUTFIT
AND I KNEW THAT GEORGETOWN HAD A VERY RICH HISTORY OF LGBTQ ACTIVISM
AND SO I MADE SURE THAT IN HIGH SCHOOL WHEN I WAS PUT IN CHARGE OF TEACHING NOVICES I WAS MY OWN JON
DOES SHE SIT AT THE COMPUTER ALL DAY
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
DID YOU SEND THAT BECAUSE I THINK YOU'VE BEEN HACKED
I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE TOLD MY MOTHER IN LAW
WE DIDN'T SEE IT COMING
WHY DON'T WE DO THAT ONLINE
BRING THE BIG FAMILY THANKSGIVING FAMILY REUNION IF IT'S NOT FAMILY IT'S YOUR TIGHT CLOSE CIRCLE OF
THE TIME I SPENT TEACHING THESE THINGS TO MY IN LAWS WAS A POWERFUL EXPERIENCE
HOW DO WE REALLY MAKE AN IMPACT
MY KIDS WERE SIX AND TEN
THAT'S UP TO YOU TO THINK ABOUT
A GIFT THAT I FEEL THAT EVERYONE DESERVES TO HAVE
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAD
IT'S A THOUGHT PROCESS YOUR WHOLE FAMILY NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND
A HIGHER LEVEL OF DIGITAL LITERACY CAN HELP
IT WILL HELP YOU MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT HELPING GUIDE OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS AND MAKING DECISIONS FOR YOURSELF
MORE AND MORE SERVICES REQUIRE YOU TO FILL OUT A FORM ONLINE
DON'T SLAM A FAMILY MEMBER OR A FRIEND FOR A CHOICE THEY MADE ONLINE
ALSO I KNOW YOU'VE SEEN IT SOMEBODY WHO POSTED SOMETHING AND YOU'RE LIKE
HOW ARE WE GOING TO HELP THEM
WE HAD NO LETTERS WE HAD NOTHING WHERE SHE SAID THIS IS EVERYTHING THAT I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER ME BY
WE DIDN'T HAVE THOSE THINGS THAT YOU WISH YOU HAD
QUIETLY NUDGING SOMEONE TO CHANGE THEIR PASSWORD BEFORE IT SPREADS TO ANOTHER FAMILY OR FRIEND
THAT'S JUST IN THIS FIRST YEAR
WHAT MAKES YOU UPSET ONLINE
MY FATHER IN LAW NOT SO INTERESTED BUT THAT'S OK BECAUSE MY MOTHER IN LAW SHE SOAKED IT IN
I'VE GOT TO SHARE THIS THIS IS AMAZING
FOR ME AND FOR THEM
DID YOU POST THAT OR IS IT A HACK
MY KID'S 12 NOW THERE'S ANOTHER ONE AS WELL
YOU DON'T HAVE TO COMMENT AND LIKE EVERYTHING WITHIN 5 MINUTES
WE REALLY SHOULDN'T BE DOING THAT ONLINE
NOBODY HAD EVER LOOKED INSIDE THE WRECK
THERE IS NO FAME IN IT
YOU KNOW I WAS A REAL SCIENCE GEEK
WE BARELY BREAK EVEN
YOU KNOW WHERE IT WAS HIGHLY TECHNICAL AND IT REQUIRED ENORMOUS PLANNING
THIS IS REALLY COOL
I COULD DRAW
SO YOU KNOW MERGING THE TWO PASSIONS
SUCH MAKESHIFT SETTLEMENTS ARE CONSIDERED ILLEGAL AND THEREFORE THOSE LIVING IN THEM DON'T HAVE A
THIS IS ESSENTIAL TO OVERCOME OUR SPEECHLESSNESS AND THE SEPARATION PROVOKED BY RIVAL POLITICAL FORCES
THE RIGHT OF ASSEMBLY AND THE RIGHT TO DEMONSTRATE ARE RESTRICTED THERE
FILES APPEARED ON THE NETWORK INCLUDING CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS LEAKED FROM THE PARLIAMENTARY INVESTIGATION COMMISSION WHICH
BUT THEY AREN'T A COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE
WE HAVE EUROPEAN PASSPORTS VISAS AND AIR TICKETS
INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET THAT COULD ENSURE SURVIVAL ALONG DANGEROUS ROUTES IS BEING CENSORED AND THE
IT IS ONLY IN TRULY EXPOSING OURSELVES TO THE TRANSFORMATIVE POWER OF THIS EXPERIENCE
THE SITUATION FOR THE ASYLUM SEEKERS IS MADE WORSE BY CONTRADICTORY POLICIES AND THE TEMPTATION OF
THEY ARE ALL ABOUT PROVIDING BASIC INFORMATION WEATHER FORECASTS LEGAL INFORMATION GUIDANCE
WHAT IS NEW IS HOW THESE REALITIES ARE HIDDEN AND HOW PEOPLE ARE MADE INVISIBLE IN AN AGE
WE ARE USED TO INVITATIONS BUT THIS INVITATION REALLY THRILLED US
AND PEOPLE DID COMMUNICATE
OVER 15000 MESSAGES WERE SENT
THEN HE LOST HIS JOB
SO THAT IS AN EXAMPLE BOTH OF WISDOM IN PRACTICE AND THE SUBVERSION OF WISDOM
THEY DIDN'T MAKE LOANS AND THEN SELL THE LOANS
JUDGE RUSSELL CREATED THE VETERANS' COURT
WISE PEOPLE KNOW HOW TO IMPROVISE
HE WAS BUSTED IN A DRUG SWEEP
HE ROBBED HIM AT GUNPOINT
AND MOST IMPORTANT A WISE PERSON DOES THIS IMPROVISING AND RULE BENDING IN THE SERVICE OF THE RIGHT AIMS
A WISE PERSON KNOWS WHEN TO IMPROVISE
THE MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE FOR ARMED ROBBERY IS FIVE YEARS
IF YOU ARE A RULE BENDER AND AN IMPROVISER MOSTLY TO SERVE YOURSELF WHAT YOU GET IS RUTHLESS
AND SECOND THEY DEMORALIZE THE ACTIVITY ITSELF
AND SO WHAT THEY DO IS THEY FOLLOW THE SCRIPTS BUT THEY FOLLOW THE SCRIPTS AT DOUBLE TIME AND
SO THE PATIENTS ARE NOT ORGAN SYSTEMS AND THEY'RE NOT DISEASES THEY'RE PEOPLE PEOPLE WITH LIVES
NOW CONSIDER MS
ALL THIS WOULD DO IS WRECK A FAMILY
IF YOU REWARD TEACHERS FOR KIDS' TEST SCORES THEY STOP CARING ABOUT EDUCATING AND ONLY CARE ABOUT TEST
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND US
SO IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF WAITING FOR THE NEXT ONE AND THEN MARVELING AT HOW WE COULD HAVE BEEN SO STUPID AS NOT TO
AND ARISTOTLE SAID HAH THEY APPRECIATED THAT SOMETIMES TO
SO IT MATTERS THAT YOU DO THIS WISE PRACTICE IN THE SERVICE OF OTHERS AND NOT IN THE SERVICE OF
WHAT COLOR IS IT
WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING AT ME HE SAID IT'S BLACK
AND ONE OF THOSE DAYS MR
BUT WE MUST TALK ABOUT IT ANYWAY
SO I WILL I'M GOING TO TURN YOU NOW ALL OF YOU INTO ONE GIANT TEDX CLAPPING ORCHESTRA
VERY NICE GOOD HEALTHY FORTE
THIS IS HOW MUSIC COMES TO LIFE
NOW FOR MANY OF US OUR FIRST VIEWS ON THIS SUBJECT WERE SHAPED BY A GREAT COLLEAGUE OF
IN PROPER SCHOOL FASHION OUR CRASH COURSE CONTINUES THE RIGHT HAND IS USED TO KEEP THE ORCHESTRA
THIS IS WHY WE NEED GREAT ART
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW WE GET AN ORCHESTRA TO ACTUALLY MAKE A SOUND TOGETHER
ALL THE WHILE THERE IS NO PERSONAL EXPRESSION GOING ON
SO IN THE CASE OF THE TCHAIKOVSKY ROMEO AND JULIET I MENTIONED THAT IT BEGINS WITH FOUR INSTRUMENTS TWO CLARINETS TWO
EACH ONE HAS AN INDEPENDENT VOICE SO IT'S LIKE A CHORAL AND WE KNOW TCHAIKOVSKY IS RUSSIAN HE WAS RAISED
HOW IS OUR CLIMATE CHANGING
IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE THE WAY IT WORKS
CLIMATE CHANGE HAPPENS
I'LL PUT DOWN THE LAWSUIT AND THEY WILL SEND ME ALL THE INFORMATION I ASK FOR
I WANT TO MAKE THEM PUBLIC
HE'S PROCESSING SO MANY DIFFERENT POSSIBLE VARIATIONS
IT WON'T BE EASY BUT GET THEM IN THE SCHOOL
MY CLASSROOM WAS ONE OF THE FIRST PILOT FOR THE FRIENDS FOR LIFE PROGRAM
HE JUST LOOKED AT ME DAD YOU JUST DON'T GET IT
WHEN HE'S ASKED WHY CAN'T YOU JUST GIVE A RESPONSE WHY CAN'T YOU JUST
WE NEED TO GET RID OF THAT GAME
HERE ARE MY RULES WHEN WORKING WITH GENERALIZED ANXIETY AND ANY SORT OF MENTAL ILLNESS
WE HAVE TO TAKE IT FOR WHAT IT IS
NOT EVEN THE CLASSROOM WE CAN WORRY ABOUT THE CLASSROOM LATER
BUT STILL I'LL GET DISTRACTED I'LL THINK WHAT ELSE MIGHT IT BE
WHAT CAN IT BE
HE HAS SO MANY POTENTIAL ANSWERS
IS THIS A TIME TO FIGHT FLIGHT OR FLEE
LIKE A DOZEN
IF YOU CAN WRITE A NOVEL THAT ONLY YOU COULD'VE WRITTEN AT THAT TIME IN THAT WAY THEN YOU MIGHT GET YOUR
THEY'VE SAID IT'S ABOUT LOVE DEATH MARRIAGE REDEMPTION BETRAYAL
BUT I DISCOVERED THE AUTHOR AND TOGETHER WE FOUND A WAY TO DISCOVER THE RIGHT STORY TO
WERE THEY BETTER WRITTEN
AND TO BE HONEST AUTHORS FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT
BUT I OFTEN SAT IN MY OFFICE WITH YOUNG WRITERS AND SAID TO THEM WHAT'S YOUR STORY ABOUT
BUT I THINK YOU'LL GET THIS IF YOU ENJOY READING
THIS WAS THE PICTURE
ALL TO TRY AND GET US TO BUY THE BOOK
ANY OTHER STORIES
AND IT DOESN'T SELL A COPY
PARTICULARLY MALE ABSENCE
DID THEY HAVE STRONGER COVERS
THAT IS THAT FEELING YOU GET WHEN YOU'VE READ A GREAT BOOK
THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS TO TELL SOMEONE ABOUT IT
READING MAKES US BETTER
WE ALLOW THEM TO HAPPEN
THIS FIRE IS THE SIZE OF WALES
WE ARE AT A STAGE WHERE WE'LL BE MAKING THOUSANDS OF MICROSCOPES
IT'S CALLED A MICROSCOPE
ANOTHER FUN FACT IS THIS IS WHAT WE ACTUALLY SEND OUT THERE AS A STANDARD DIAGNOSTIC TOOL
WE ARE STARTING AT THE END OF THE SUMMER
BUT WHAT HAD TO BE DONE THERE WAS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT
AND WE SAW THE U
BUT WHAT WE SAW WAS SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT
THERE WAS SO MUCH DISEASE THEY APPROACHED IT DIFFERENTLY
BUT CAN YOU ACTUALLY DRIVE IT DOWN TO ZERO
AGENCIES AND MANY HUMANITARIAN AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT CAME AND JOINED THE FIGHT TO TRY AND STOP
AND FOR THIS REASON THEY WERE DEEPLY DISTURBED DEEPLY ALARMED AND THE ENTIRE EPIDEMIC WAS UNRAVELING
BUT HOW DID EBOLA END UP IN LOFA COUNTY IN THE FIRST PLACE
THIS TIME IT WAS IN NIGERIA IN THE TEEMING METROPOLIS OF LAGOS 21 MILLION
THE KOREAN WORD FOR SWEET IS
THE KOREAN WORD FOR THE GAME OF DEATH IS
LET US SWIG OUR GATORADE SWEETER
TIME IS RUNNING OUT
WHERE SINGERS ARE CALLED IDOLS
SEOUL KEEPS THE LONELY LOCKED AWAY IN FAST FOOD ICE CUBES AND THE PROPER CUM DUMPSTERS
HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP IS MY BOYFRIEND
THAT IS ONCE THEY RE CUT UP BOOT CAMPED AND REUPHOLSTERED THEN RECORD FIVE TRACK ALBUMS
POP GOES THE FACE SHOP
WE HAVE WORN DOWN OUR JAWS CHEWING BARLEY FOR CENTURIES NOW LET US EAT
I DRAW EVERYTHING AND IT'S IN REAL TIME AND EVERYBODY DRAWS
IT IS A LEARNING CIRCUIT
SHE TOLD ME THE SAME DAY THAT HUMMUS IS MADE UP OF GROUND UP HUMMINGBIRDS
BECAUSE OF THEIR BASAL GANGLIA AND THEIR CEREBELLUM
DID I HEAR A CLICK
AND AS A TEACHER I WAS USING ONE
AND AS YOU PRACTICE THE BASAL GANGLIA AND THE CEREBELLUM MAKE YOU BETTER
THAT IS FANTASTIC
AND I HAD A LITTLE BIT OF TREPIDATION ABOUT WALKING UP TO HIM BECAUSE HE HAD RETIRED EARLY
IN MY CLASS EVERYTHING IS ON THE BOARD
THESE GUYS WE WOULD GO HEAD TO HEAD AND THEY WOULD CRUSH US
AND I SAID I KNEW THAT
AND HE GOES ROSE
THE POWER OF MAYBE
AS A TEACHER HOW DO YOU DO THIS
WELL STUDENTS ARE VETERANS OF THE CLASSROOM SO I CERTAINLY DON'T HELP
DAVID WIRTSHAFTER AND HIS WIFE WALKING DOWN MICHIGAN AVENUE
BUT SOME OF THEM ARE RED HOT FIVE STARS
IT'S HOW YOU FLAVOR IT HOW THE EMOTION IS ADDED TO IT
MAYBE WE'RE GOING TO WIN MAYBE WE'RE NOT
WAS THAT THE FUEL PUMP THAT CLICKED IN
HIPPO CAMPUS RIGHT
TWO OR THREE TIMES A WEEK FOR MANY YEARS AFTER THAT I WOULD GO TO THE LATE NIGHT
SO I PUT TOGETHER THIS DETAILED SYLLABUS I HAD OVERHEADS WITH EVERYTHING THAT YOU COULD
AND FOR DECADES NEUROSCIENTISTS HAVE BEEN FIGURING OUT THE ANATOMY AND THE PHYSIOLOGY OF THE BRAIN
THE POWER OF MAYBE
IT'S TRUE IT MAKES SENSE BUT IT'S SURPRISING
I BOTH LOVE AND HATE THE BUSINESS OF HUMAN RESOURCES AND YOU WILL SOON UNDERSTAND WHY
AND THE BURDEN OF PROOF OF COURSE IS ON THEM NOT ON US
SO THE QUESTION BECOMES
YOU ARE A MARTYR YOU ARE A QUEEN
LEAVING THIS EARTH TODAY WHAT WOULD BE YOUR LEGACY
YOU ARE AN EMPOWERING WOMAN
AND SURE THE CONVERSATION MAY BE FAR FROM SPARKLING BUT AT LEAST IT'S SAFE
IF ALL THAT WE'RE GIVEN COMES FROM THAT WHICH WE GIVE WHY DO WE OFFER OURSELVES SUCH A PALTRY SUM
YOU ARE A GIFT TO MANKIND
SO I ASK YOU AGAIN WOMAN DO YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE
YOU ARE AN EMPOWERING WOMAN SHARING THE PHENOMENON THAT IS CALLED LOVE
YOU ARE THE RAREST TREASURE OF ALL TO FIND
THROUGH NO RHYME OR REASON DISCOVERED BECAUSE I FELT I HAD NO CHOICE
YOU ARE A TEACHER AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN
WE ARE THE PILLARS OF OUR FAMILIES YET SOME OF US STILL POSSESS NO SELF WORTH
WE NEVER GIVE OURSELVES ENOUGH CREDIT AND WE ALLOW OTHERS TO PUT US DOWN
MEDIOCRITY'S FEATURE THAT'S THE SADDEST ISN'T ITS FAIR TO MIDDLING STATUS
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE CHOICE THAT DECIDES IF YOU LOSE OR GAIN
NOW ONE NEED NOT BE SOCRATES TO DEFINE THIS WORD ON MY MIND
TO THOSE WARY OF DOING TOO MUCH OR TOO LITTLE THE MIDDLE BOWL JUTS COMFORTABLY WITH LOTS OF COMPANY
SO HERE'S WHERE I WANT TO TAKE A SECOND TO ASK YOU A VERY SIMPLE BUT RATHER SIGNIFICANT QUESTION
I'M FALLING AND MY GRADES ARE BAD I NEED TO LEAVE
AND THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
PAUSING IS THE THINGS THAT YOU DO ALREADY
WE WOULD ALWAYS WANT TO BE THE OTHER PERFECT PERSON
WHAT'S MY OBJECTIVE OF DECIDING TO STAY HERE
NOW I COULD PAUSE IN THE MORNING
I'M NOT OBSESSED OVER SOCIAL MEDIA ANYMORE
AND SO WE START FAKING OUR LIVES
WHAT EXACTLY DO I KNOW ABOUT MYSELF TO HAVE EVEN DECIDED I WANT TO STAY HERE
I SAID DAD LISTEN I CAN'T DO THIS I HAVE TO LEAVE
BUT IT'S NOT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO
WHERE DO I WANT TO BE IN FOUR YEARS
WHERE DO I WANT TO BE
SO NOW I WAS OBSESSED OVER PAUSING
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT AWARE OF IT THEN YOU WOULDN'T REALLY CARE IF IT GOES AWAY FROM YOUR LIFE
YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK
BUT I REMEMBER VERY CLEARLY I LOOKED AT MYSELF IN THE MIRROR THAT DAY AND I ASKED MYSELF ONE SIMPLE QUESTION
WE WOULD ALWAYS WANT TO INCREASE OUR LIKES AND THAT'S VERY DANGEROUS
YOU START CREATING AN IDEAL SELF OF YOURSELF IT'S LIKE A SUPERHERO
AND I WOULD HAVE SIMPLY SAID BEING ON THE STAGE IS OUT OF REACH
WHAT EXACTLY IS THAT MOMENT OF MY DAY THAT I WOULD DO AND I WOULD LOVE TO APPRECIATE AND EMBRACE IT MORE OFTEN
BUT THE SECOND THING I WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH A CHALLENGE A CHALLENGE IN THE SENSE OF IT'S A PROMISE A PROMISE FOR YOURSELF TO CHANGE FOR
AND THE USUAL THING HAPPENED WE RUSHED ACROSS CAMPUS AND AT THE END OF THE DAY JUST BEFORE GETTING TO BED I WAS
IS MY LIFE SIMPLY TOO BUSY WITH ESSAYS
AND I MEAN IT WHEN I SAY A LOT
THE SOCIAL PLATFORMS THAT CLAIM TO MAKE US MORE SOCIAL
EVEN BEING HERE TODAY COULD BE A PAUSE MOMENT
AND THAT'S A BIG QUESTION
DURING THE RACE EVERYTHING CAME TOGETHER
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN OPTIMISTIC ETC
PEOPLE GET REALLY HUNG UP ON THE QUESTION WELL WOULD YOU WANT YOUR DAUGHTER DOING IT
THE SOLUTION IS CLEARLY TO GIVE WORKERS MORE LEGAL PROTECTIONS ALLOWING THEM TO RESIST ABUSE AND REPORT IT TO
THE WAY THE TERM TRAFFICKING IS THROWN AROUND IMPLIES THAT ALL UNDOCUMENTED MIGRATION INTO PROSTITUTION IS
AND SO THE FINES STACK UP AND YOU'RE CAUGHT IN A VICIOUS CYCLE OF SELLING SEX TO PAY THE FINES YOU GOT
CRACKDOWNS ON BUYERS DRIVE SELLERS TO TAKE DANGEROUS RISKS AND INTO THE ARMS OF POTENTIALLY ABUSIVE MANAGERS
THESE LAWS ALSO REINFORCE STIGMA AND HATRED AGAINST SEX WORKERS
IT SEEMS THAT SOMETIMES THE THINGS MAY BE OBTAINED DISCOVERIES CAN BE FOUND DOTS
USUALLY THE SCIENTISTS SHOW SOME GRAPHS OR SOME
WE THEREOF MAKE SOME ERRORS
WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
WE CAN RECONNECT THE SPOTS AND SO WE SEE THE ANIMAL
HOW DO WE KNOW IT
IT ALWAYS COMES TO THE WALL
THEN ACCIDENTALLY BY PLAYING WITH HIPPOCAMPUS HE FOUND THAT SOME CELLS WHICH RESPOND ONLY WHEN THE
WE DID NOT KNOW HOW THE MAP IS CONSTRUCTED
EDISON JUST CONNECTED THE DOTS FOR A LONG TIME TO MAKE AN ELECTRIC BULB
THEY HAD NO CHOICE
IT ACTUALLY REFLECTS CHANGES IN THE BRAIN THAT PROVIDE AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY FOR
SO IN MY LAB WE BRING ADOLESCENTS AND ADULTS INTO THE LAB TO HAVE A BRAIN SCAN WE GIVE THEM SOME KIND
IT'S A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY FOR LEARNING AND CREATIVITY
SO FOR EXAMPLE TAKE RISK TAKING
IT'S PARTLY DEPENDENT ON THE ENVIRONMENT THAT THE ANIMAL OR THE HUMAN IS IN AND THE SYNAPSES THAT ARE
YOU PRUNE AWAY THE WEAKER BRANCHES SO THAT THE REMAINING IMPORTANT BRANCHES CAN GROW STRONGER
SO A SECOND LINE OF INQUIRY THAT WE USE TO TRACK CHANGES IN THE ADOLESCENT BRAIN IS USING FUNCTIONAL
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO ENGAGE IN
BUT FAILURE IS NOTHING MORE THAN A SETBACK
WE NEED OTHER PEOPLE
THE OTHER AREA WAS MY VIEW OF FAILURE
I USED MY FAITH MY FRIENDS MY FAMILY
AND IT IS YOUR MINDSET
WHETHER I WAS A GOOD PERSON OR A BAD PERSON
SO AGAIN I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SCALE IS FOR YOU BUT THINK ABOUT RETRAINING YOUR MIND TO DEFINE SUCCESS IN ANOTHER
ONE OF THE THINGS I DID WAS SET MYSELF CHALLENGES
ACTUALLY I CAN REMEMBER MORE OF THE THINGS I'VE GIVEN AWAY THAN THE THINGS THAT I'VE KEPT SO FOR ME THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT
HOW WHY AND WHERE IT WENT TO WAS OF LESS IMPORTANCE TO ME
THAT HELPED ME TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE RUTHLESS WHEN I WAS GOING THROUGH THINGS
SO IT STARTED ME THINKING ABOUT A PROJECT TO GET RID OF 1000 THINGS
BUT WHAT I DIDN'T REALLY DO IS THINK ABOUT THE DAY TO DAY THINGS THE THINGS I BROUGHT INTO MY HOUSE OR TOOK OUT OF MY HOUSE ALL THE
THE THIRD THING IS
I DIDN'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THINGS
ALTHOUGH OBVIOUSLY I MADE SURE THAT I COULD DONATE OR RECYCLE AS MUCH AS I COULD THE ESSENCE WAS ABOUT IT LEAVING MY
I HAD ALL OF THOSE THINGS
SO I HAD THIS WEIRD MIXTURE OF VALUES WHICH WERE BASICALLY LIKE I NEED TO KEEP HOLD OF EVERYTHING I HAVE BUT EQUALLY I NEED TO
DOES ANYONE ELSE REMEMBER THAT
THEY'RE UP ALL NIGHT WATCHING PORN
OH I DON'T DO THAT
I'LL EVEN ASK EIGHT YEAR OLDS
ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY HAD MOBILE TECHNOLOGY
IF THEY DON'T DO THAT THEN THEY HAVE TO DRINK TWO OR THREE SHOTS
IF YOU DON'T PROVIDE YOUR CHILDREN WITH LEADERSHIP OF COURSE WILL TURN SOMEWHERE ELSE
HOW DO I KNOW THEY'RE WATCHING PORN
IT'S JUST AWKWARD
EVERY SINGLE PARENT SAYS I DON'T THINK SO
THEY TELL ME ALL THE TIME
I SAY WHAT DO YOU LOOK AT ON THE INTERNET
THEN THEY DRAG THEIR MOUTH DOWN THE GUY'S PENIS LEAVING A RAINBOW BEHIND
AND THEN THEY DON'T HAVE ANYONE TO TALK TO BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT'S BAD
NOW I HAD AN EIGHT YEAR OLD BY THIS TIME I HAD PROGRESSED I HAD GROWN
EVERY SINGLE PARENT THAT I'VE TALKED TO OF A TEENAGER ALL SAY ARE THEY LOOKING AT PORN
TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON TAKE ME THROUGH A DAY
THEY WERE ON THE INTERNET FOR EVERYTHING
I WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT WASN'T GOING OH YES
THEY'RE ALWAYS GOING TO BE SMARTER THAN US BECAUSE TO THEM IT ISN'T TECHNOLOGY
I DIDN'T REALLY LIKE HIM THAT MUCH SO I WOULDN'T LET HIM KISS ME
SO I SAID OK I NEED TO TALK TO HIM
AND THAT'S WHERE ENTERS ANOTHER PART
MAYBE I'LL CONTINUE RESEARCHING
I WAS HEALTHY ONCE MORE
BUT I ONLY FOUND MORE GAPS BECAUSE I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND WHY THERE IS ONE STUFF WHICH IS RED AND
THAT WORD I DON'T KNOW
HE TOOK COLLEGE CREDIT COURSES SO WHEN HE GOT OUT HE WAS ABLE TO GET A MASTER'S AND TODAY HE'S A MANAGER AT
IT BECAME MUCH MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO HER NOT ONLY TO HER BUT ALSO TO HER BELOVED
BEFORE EVEN WHEN SHE WAS ONLY VISUALLY IMPAIRED SHE WOULD BE ABLE TO TALK TO ANYBODY
AND SO INSTEAD OF READING YOU CAN PRODUCE THINGS
AND IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN A REALLY SUCCESSFULL WAY OF INTRODUCING THE MEANS OF
HOW AM I GOING TO COME UP WITH THIS MONEY IN ORDER TO PROVIDE FOR MY DAUGHTER
I JUST KNEW I HAD TO STOP AND GET MYSELF OUT OF PAIN
I WAS BRINGING MY BABY GIRL HOME
NOT SURE ANYBODY KNOWS HOW IT FEELS TO NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR YOUR DAUGHTER ON CHRISTMAS ONE OF
I'VE NEVER EVEN BEEN TO THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE
I'D BEEN SUPERMAN MY WHOLE LIFE
I WAS OVERWHELMED
I WANTED HER JUST TO GET BETTER
I REMEMBER GOING TO THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND MAKING SURE SURE THEY INSTALLED THE CAR SEAT SAFELY
I WAS THE HAPPIEST FATHER ON EARTH
BUT FROM TEXAS CALIFORNIA VANCOUVER NEW ZEALAND IRAQ
I READ SOME TO HER SHE READS SOME TO ME
WE APPRECIATE THEM EXACTLY FOR THE SAME QUALITIES THAT MAKE THEM
IF JENIPHER WANTS CREDIT HER OPTIONS ARE LIMITED
IT GOES AGAINST NATURE
4 MILLION OTHER SPECIES ON THE PLANET
WE DON'T JUST ADD NUTRITION DIRECTLY TO THE SOIL
THAT WOULD BE THE INDUSTRIAL WAY
I SMILE WORK HARD WHY SHOULD MY CONSCIENCE TWITCH OR FLINCH
FIRST MY BOOK PAINFUL HOPE
BUT I SAID NO
I'M NOT A VICTIM ANYMORE
FROM ALL THOSE DEVELOPMENTAL INTERACTIONS THAT I'VE SHOWED YOU BEFORE
THIS IS A FREE TOOL LENDING SERVICE
THERE'S NO CAPITAL FOR THE NON PROFIT
WE HAD TO FIND FREE AND FOUND MATERIALS EVERY NIGHT SO WE COULD WORK THE NEXT
I JUST FEEL LOCKED IN FEAR
LANGUAGES ARE OFTEN PERCEIVED TO BE THE GREAT UNKNOWN
I CAN'T PROMISE YOU THIS
IT'S ACTUALLY THE ONLY WAY WE CAN GET THINGS RIGHT
AS CHILDREN WE'RE EVEN EXPECTED TO MAKE THEM
BECAUSE IN OUR PLASTIC AGE PLASTIC IS EVERYWHERE IT'S EVEN HIDDEN IN PRODUCTS WHERE WE NEVER EXPECTED IT TO
I'LL TELL YOU WHY
I'VE ALREADY TOLD YOU THE FIRST ONE FIRST ONE IS IT'S REALLY ECO FRIENDLY
NOW I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO GO AROUND AND SAY OH MY GOD I LOVE THAT SKIRT YOU SHOULD WEAR THAT EVERYDAY OH MY GOD
IF SOMEONE IS TRYING TO CROSS THE ROAD HELP THEM CROSS THE ROAD
I REMEMBER THAT DAY I PROMISED MYSELF I WOULD NEVER HELP ANYONE AGAIN
YOU DON'T DO IT AS A HUMAN BEING
THINK OF IT AS A PROJECT THAT SPANS OVER ABOUT 10 YEARS
WE THEN DECIDED TO SCALE IT UP
THAT'S ALL THE U
IF YOU HAD CHARGE SPOTS EVERYWHERE AND YOU HAD BATTERY SWAP STATIONS EVERYWHERE HOW OFTEN WOULD YOU DO IT
WHO IS ONE OF MY IDOLS
AND PICK THE TWO BEST PLACES THE ONE WHERE YOU DIDN'T NEED ANY RANGE EXTENSION
WE DIDN'T SAY WE'RE GOING TO SEND A MAN 20 PERCENT TO THE MOON
WE'RE GOING TO REVIVE THE ECONOMY
A FULL BATTERY COMES ON
IT'S CALLED THE TRILLION DOLLAR STIMULUS PACKAGE
YOU DO IT AS A MACHINE
I KNOW MOST PEOPLE DON'T THINK OF ISRAEL AS A SMALL ISLAND BUT ISRAEL IS AN ISLAND IT'S A TRANSPORTATION ISLAND
SOME OF IT WILL GO BACK TO YOUR OWN POCKET
I SHARED IT WITH A GENTLEMAN CALLED BOBBY KENNEDY JR
AND THESE PRICES ARE ACTUALLY WITH CLEAN ELECTRONS
WE DECIDED TO COME INTO THE U
HAWAII YOU CAN DRIVE AROUND THE ISLAND ON ONE BATTERY
WE DON'T HAVE THE INDUSTRY SET RIGHT
NOW WE'RE RUNNING A STIMULUS PACKAGE
WE GO BACK DOWN
I TOLD HIM ONE OF THE REASONS THAT HIS UNCLE WAS REMEMBERED IS BECAUSE HE SAID WE'RE GOING TO SEND A
WE HAVE ALL THESE REGIONS
PERES I WILL BUILD YOU THE CARS
AS A MATTER OF FACT WE ADDED TO THE CONTRACT
WE HAVE A BATTERY BAY
CHINA SOLVES IT BY AN EDICT
THE SECOND ONE WAS THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA WHERE GAVIN NEWSOM CREATED A BEAUTIFUL POLICY ACROSS ALL THE MAYORS
THAT'S ANOTHER 30 PERCENT DEMAND ON OIL
AND YOU DRIVE ON
AND NOT FROM THE POWER OF AN EDICT DOWN
NOW IT SOUNDS CRAZY
BUT IN SOME PLACES AROUND THE WORLD LIKE SCANDINAVIA YOU ALREADY HAVE THAT
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS AT THAT POINT
AND IF YOU REALLY HAVE A LONG DAY YOU CAN SWITCH AND KEEP ON DRIVING AROUND THE ISLAND
IT'S A GOOD POINT WELL MADE
IT'S AN AREA THE SIZE OF EUROPE 24 MILLION PEOPLE ONE OF THE MOST DEPRIVED PARTS OF THE
MARKETS MOVE AND TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF CAPITAL MOVE AROUND THE WORLD BASED ON WHICH COUNTRIES ARE GOING UP
THERE'S A LOT OF SOCIAL PROGRESS BANG FOR YOUR GDP BUCK
IMAGINE IF WE COULD MEASURE WHAT NONPROFITS CHARITIES VOLUNTEERS CIVIL
IN THE 21ST CENTURY WE FACE NEW CHALLENGES AGING OBESITY CLIMATE
TO FACE THOSE CHALLENGES WE NEED NEW TOOLS OF MEASUREMENT NEW WAYS OF VALUING
GDP HAS DEFINED AND SHAPED OUR LIVES FOR THE LAST 80 YEARS
IT'S NOT A MEASURE OF OUR WELL BEING
AND IT SHOULDN'T BE A GUIDE TO ALL DECISION MAKING
WE LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE GDP IS THE BENCHMARK OF SUCCESS IN A GLOBAL ECONOMY
I IGNORED THOSE VOICES AND I MOVED FORWARD
I'D NEVER HEARD OF THIS TRAIL
AND WE'D SAY NO
AND THAT SUFFERING WAS THE GREATEST THAT I HAD EVER SUFFERED
WHAT'S THE GREATER MEANING
SHE WAS REALLY MY ONLY PARENT
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL I WAS DOING
I WAS LIVING IN MINNESOTA AT THE TIME I WAS A WAITRESS AND I WAS STANDING IN LINE AT AN
I DID ALL KINDS OF THINGS
I WAS OUT THERE 94 DAYS
THAT STRENGTH WAS A VERY HUMBLE THING
I READ THE BACK OF THE BOOK I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING
UNTIL SHE WAS REACHING AS WIDE AS SHE COULD REACH
AND THE ANSWER WAS ALWAYS NO
EVEN THOUGH ALL THESE VOICES AROUND ME SAID THAT'S NOT REASONABLE
I HAVE AN EXCUSE AS TO WHY MY BASEMENT IS SO HIDEOUS
ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO MY HUSBAND AND I AND OUR KIDS MOVED
I KEEP SAYING WE MOVED BUT ACTUALLY MY HUSBAND WHO'S IN THE ROOM A VERY EXTRAORDINARY MAN BUT
THAT IS UNFAIR BUT THAT IS THE REALITY
AND THAT'S THE STRANGE THING ABOUT ADVICE
WORK WITH ADVICE THAT WORKS FOR YOUR FAMILY
THEY HOPED THAT THEIR CHILDREN WOULD UNDERSTAND THEIR REASONS FOR MAKING THE FAMILY IN THIS WAY
WE DO TESTS WE DO FOLLOW UP STUDIES
WE WILL SAY NO YOU DO NOT HAVE A DAD
CAN YOU TELL ME HOW YOU CAME INTO THE FAMILY
ONE COUPLE EXPLAINED THEIR INSEMINATION BY TAKING THEIR CHILDREN TO A FARM
SO IT IS DIY
BUT WHAT DOES MAKE THEM SO DIFFERENT
THE FLOCK OF BIRDS I MENTIONED BEFORE IS BEAUTIFUL IN SO MANY WAYS
WHAT MAKES THIS EVER SO BEAUTIFUL SHAPE THAT OUR EYES ARE NATURALLY DRAWN TO
SO I THOUGHT YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO START WITH CONNECTION
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE WHEN YOU CALL YOUR FRIENDS AND SAY I THINK I NEED TO SEE SOMEBODY
OUR JOB IS TO LOOK AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT
AND SHE SAID BUT THE THING I LIKED ABOUT YOUR TALK IS YOU'RE A STORYTELLER
AND IT TOOK ABOUT A YEAR
THERE'S NO DISCOURSE ANYMORE
AND I THOUGHT WELL WHAT'S THE STRUGGLE
THIS IS WHAT POLITICS LOOKS LIKE TODAY
WELL APPARENTLY THIS IS THE WAY MY WORK WENT AS WELL BECAUSE WHEN YOU ASK PEOPLE ABOUT LOVE
AND SHE SAID WHAT'S THE STRUGGLE
AND THE FIRST WORDS THAT CAME TO MY MIND WERE WHOLE HEARTED
THEY JUST TALKED ABOUT IT BEING NECESSARY
AND I SAID BUT HERE'S THE THING NO FAMILY STUFF NO CHILDHOOD SHIT
AND SO THEN I WENT BACK INTO THE RESEARCH AND SPENT THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS REALLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY THE WHOLE
YOU CANNOT SELECTIVELY NUMB
CAN I BE THIS FIERCE ABOUT THIS
AND I KNOW THAT'S KNOWING LAUGHTER
SHE SAID WHAT'S GOING ON
AS YOU KNOW IT'S NOT GOING TO TURN OUT WELL
I HAVE A SLIGHT OFFICE SUPPLY ADDICTION BUT THAT'S ANOTHER TALK
HERE'S VULNERABILITY HERE'S GRIEF HERE'S SHAME HERE'S FEAR HERE'S DISAPPOINTMENT
YOU KNOW HOW BLAME IS DESCRIBED IN THE RESEARCH
I'M A QUALITATIVE RESEARCHER
AND MAYBE STORIES ARE JUST DATA WITH A SOUL
AND SHE CALLED AND SHE SAID I'M REALLY STRUGGLING WITH HOW TO WRITE ABOUT YOU ON THE LITTLE FLYER
CAN I BELIEVE IN THIS THIS PASSIONATELY
WHY DO WE STRUGGLE WITH IT SO MUCH
AND THE ONLY WAY TO DO IT IS TO WRITE ALL THE TIME
AND THAT RESULTS IN DIFFERENT CULTURE AND COMPLEX SOCIAL STRUCTURE IN DIFFERENT DOLPHIN
FOR AN EXTREMELY ACOUSTIC ANIMAL LIKE DOLPHINS LONG TIME EXPOSURE TO NOISE WILL RESULT IN
IT TURNS OUT WHEN WE'RE BUMMED OUT WE BUY THINGS THAT MAKE US FEEL BETTER
YOU WANT TO MANAGE YOUR SUPPLY CHAIN YOU'RE THE MANAGER AT A STORE AND YOU WANT TO CHANGE WHAT PROMOTIONS YOU HAVE
COUCHES AND REFRIGERATORS AND NEW CARS
MEASURE THE SENTIMENT OF THOSE TWEETS
WELL WHEN TWITTER STARTED THAT WAS A HUGE PROBLEM RIGHT
CAN WE START TO FIGURE OUT HOW DOES THE COUNTRY FEEL TODAY
HOW DOES COLORADO FEEL TODAY
OR ISN'T THAT JUST POLLING
SO I THINK WE NEED TO PUT A HOLD ON THIS BUT THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO NOT ONLY DISAGREE WITH ME
IT DIDN'T WORK PERFECTLY BUT I STILL THINK THEY SORT OF CRACKED THE DOOR AJAR ON A
TO ME AS A SCIENTIST THAT'S FANTASTIC BUT AGAIN AT THE SAME TIME IT OPENS THE DOOR
WE HAVE TO BAN THIS
IT WAS INCREDIBLE
BUT MY RULE HAS ALWAYS BEEN
WE REALIZED THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE VERY WILLING TO CONTRIBUTE TO MEANINGFUL CHANGE
JUST TO BE CLEAR WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TO RECEIVING DONATIONS
THERE HAVE BEEN AMAZING ACHIEVEMENTS BY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ORGANIZATIONS STATES' ENVIRONMENTAL
IT WAS WHEN I SPENT TIME SAILING ON THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA AND I SAW MORE WASTE FLOATING AROUND IN
IT SHOULD NOT BE OUR OBJECTIVE TO HAVE GOOD LAWS OR GOOD POLICIES IT SHOULD BE OUR OBJECTIVE TO HAVE
I SEE THAT YOU GET VERY TIRED
TODAY WE'RE FINALLY DISCUSSING WHAT THIS HOSPITAL DOES THE RIGHT WAY
FIFTY PERCENT RISK
BUT MOST OF THEM DON'T KNOW
AND I WAS LIKE WHOA I GUESS WE GET TO SAY ANYTHING OUT LOUD
I FELL IN LOVE WITH PAUL AS I WATCHED THE CARE HE TOOK WITH HIS PATIENTS
WE GOT MARRIED AND BECAME DOCTORS
I WAS WORKING AS AN INTERNIST AND PAUL WAS FINISHING HIS TRAINING AS A NEUROSURGEON
PAUL DIDN'T WANT A VENTILATOR AND CPR
WE LACK THIS MICROBIAL DIVERSITY NOWADAYS
AT THE MOMENT WORKING IN THE LATVIAN BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH AND STUDY CENTRE WE HAVE MANAGED TO IDENTIFY
BUT I HAVE A FEELING THAT YOU MAY APPRECIATE IT IF I TALKED ABOUT THEM AS A WHOLE RATHER THAN PIECE BY
AND I WAS AN AMAZING ART STUDENT
BUT ONCE I FINISHED THE PROGRAM I PROMPTLY FELL APART
ON JANUARY 15TH I SENT AN EMAIL TO ALL MY FRIENDS AND RELATIVES DESCRIBING MY
BECAUSE AFTER ALL IF YOU ASK EVEN GROWNUPS ABOUT STATISTICS THEY LOOK EXTREMELY STUPID
SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE PAY ATTENTION IS THAT THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX THE SORT OF EXECUTIVE PART OF OUR BRAINS SENDS A SIGNAL
THEY GO OUT AND TEST IT AGAINST THE EVIDENCE
AND IN STUDIES WE'VE JUST BEEN DOING IN MY LAB SIMILAR STUDIES WE'VE SHOW THAT FOUR YEAR OLDS ARE ACTUALLY BETTER AT
AND WHAT BAYES SHOWED WAS A MATHEMATICAL WAY THAT YOU COULD DO THAT
WHEREAS THE CHICKENS ARE ACTUALLY MATURE WITHIN A COUPLE OF MONTHS
AND THAT ONE BIG DISADVANTAGE IS THAT UNTIL YOU ACTUALLY DO ALL THAT LEARNING YOU'RE GOING TO BE HELPLESS
WE DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING
WE DO IT BY MAKING IT RELATABLE
IF THE VICTIM IS CARED FOR AND SUPPORTED THEY ARE LESS LIKELY TO SHOW SYMPTOMS OF PTSD AND
LET'S START WITH DAY TO DAY THINGS
SO THIS IS A CALL TO ACTION FOR MEN TO JOIN THE RANKS
THIS COMES MORE EASILY AND MORE QUICKLY FOR SOME CLIENTS THAN IT DOES FOR OTHERS
HOW DO WE ENGAGE MORE MAN IN THE PREVENTION OF VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN
THE QUESTION SHOULD BE
SO AS I POSED THESE QUESTIONS I'M POSING THEM FOR EVERYONE
THERE'S A GROUNDBREAKING RESEARCH ON THIS THAT COMES FROM DR REBECCA CAMPBELL
WHEN IT COMES UP HOW DO YOU TALK ABOUT RAPE
TO STRENGTHEN OUR TEAM OF ALLIES
BUT THE QUESTION SHOULD NOT BE
DO YOU AUTOMATICALLY BECOME DEFENSIVE WHEN YOU HEAR DISCUSSIONS AROUND MALE PRIVILEGE
A SIBLING A FRIEND A ROOMMATE
2 OR 3 TIMES A YEAR I ATTEND NATIONAL CONFERENCES RELATED TO THIS TOPIC AND THE GENDER SPLIT AT THESE
IT WAS ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH THIS PROCESS THAT I STARTED TO NOTICE A COMMON THEME AMONG MANY OF MY CLIENTS
REGARDLESS OF WHERE I WORKED OR WHAT MY CLIENTS LOOKED LIKE SO MANY OF THEM WERE LIVING WITH INSTANCES OR
THERAPISTS ARE TRAINED TO LISTEN TO THEIR CLIENTS
AND IF SO HOW DO YOU DO IT
I MEAN HOW REAL CAN FILMS GET
SO I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HOW FILM HAS CHANGED
HE THOUGHT HE WAS A REAL PRISONER
WE DON'T HAVE TO REFLECT ON THIS RIGHT
JOHN HAMMOND IS REFLECTING HE'S PLAYED BY THE LATE LORD RICHARD ATTENBOROUGH AND HE'S REFLECTING ON HIS
WHEN I SAW JURASSIC PARK I WAS BLOWN AWAY
WE MEASURED THEIR PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES WHILE THEY WATCHED THESE
THAT'S ALL IT IS
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT
I HAD A VARIETY OF ANSWERS THAT I TRIED OUT
SOME OF THEM MADE SENSE
WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S THE SOCIAL AND THE EMOTIONAL ASPECTS OF LANGUAGE LEARNING THAT DECIDE EVERYTHING
ALL THE VOCABULARY
AT LEAST THAT FOOT IN THE DOOR
ALL THE GRAMMAR
THAT CAN TAKE A LOT OF THE PRESSURE OFF OF THE PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN TOLD YOU NEED TO ABANDON YOUR SMALL LANGUAGE IN FAVOR
HOW I THINK
FIRST AND FOREMOST WHAT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND IS OUR OWN PSYCHOLOGY
ENOUGH TO GET STARTED TO GET GOING ENOUGH TO JOIN THAT SPEECH COMMUNITY AND BE PART OF IT
WHEN WE FALL TO LEARN LANGUAGES
HOW DO WE GET THAT FOOT IN THE DOOR
IT'S NO SECRET THAT THE U
IN THE LATE 1990S A COUPLE OF PROFESSORS PROPOSED A CONCEPT FOR RADICALLY REDUCING THE
GOVERNMENT HAD FOUND A POWERFUL OPTIMAL TRADEOFF THAT IN TAKING PICTURES AT RIGHT ABOUT ONE METER
WHY BUILD THESE SATELLITES
AND AFRAID OF DYING
BUT IT CAN BE DIFFICULT WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH THESE VERY TOUGH CONDITIONS PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY STRESSED TO MAKE A
I HAVE A SIMPLE PHILOSOPHY IN TERMS OF PLANNING AND PREPARING FOR MY EXPEDITIONS AND IT'S CALLED TRAIN HARD AND TRAVEL
WE HAD A VERY CLOSE ENCOUNTER WITH TWO POLAR BEARS EARLY ON IN THE EXPEDITION AS WELL
IT'S HARD TO DESCRIBE WHERE PASSION COMES FROM BUT THE GOAL OF ANY OF MY ADVENTURES IS TO REMIND US ALL THAT
THERE'S NO LAND THERE'S NO MARKER THAT ICE IS MOVING AND DRIFTING SO AFTER A FEW MINUTES WE
AFRAID OF BEING A FAILURE
AND ONE PLACE IN PARTICULAR
A COLD PLACE THE COLDEST PLACE THE ARCTIC OCEAN
IT'S A PLACE THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE REALLY UNDERSTAND
SO AS YOU CAN GUESS MY MOTHER TONGUE IS FRENCH
AND AS MY IMAGE IS ALREADY INSIDE THE PAPER I JUST HAVE TO
SHE CAN GO TO AIRBNB TO LIST HER SOFA BED SHE CAN GO TO TASKRABBIT
AND IMAGINE THAT THE CONSORTIA WHO BID TO RUN IT ARE TOLD WHOEVER COMES IN AT THE LOWEST PERCENTAGE
IT'S ALL EXTREMELY LOW OVERHEAD
SOME ROUGH RESEARCH SUGGESTS THIS COULD UNLOCK AROUND 100 MILLION POUNDS' WORTH A DAY OF NEW ECONOMIC
WELL SHE MIGHT BE WILLING TO WORK ODD HOURS IN A CALL CENTER IN A RECEPTION AREA IN A MAIL ROOM
IT MANAGES COUNTERPARTY RISK IN INCREDIBLY SOPHISTICATED WAYS
SO IF THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH A SHORTAGE OF BABYSITTERS IN SOME PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND THE PROBLEM IS NOBODY CAN AFFORD THE VETTING AND
THERE IS A PRECEDENT FOR TECHNOLOGY ENABLED SERVICE THAT HAS BEEN INITIATED BY POLITICIANS IN
WHICH IS A TRAGEDY BECAUSE THERE ARE EMPLOYERS WHO CAN USE POOLS OF VERY FLEXIBLE LOCAL PEOPLE
SO IT'S SMALL TRADES BY SMALL PEOPLE BUT IT'S VERY INFORMED SAFE
SO GOVERNMENT THEN EXITS THE FRAME
AND IT'S EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT FOR THESE PEOPLE TO FIND THE WORK THAT THEY SO OFTEN NEED VERY BADLY
A MODERN MARKET IS MORE THAN A WEBSITE IT'S A WEB OF INTEROPERABLE MARKETPLACES BACK
MAYBE I CAN WORK TOMORROW BUT I DON'T KNOW IF AND WHEN YET
AND IT'S NOT JUST CATERERS IT'S HOTELIERS IT'S RETAILERS IT'S ANYONE WHO PROVIDES SERVICES TO THE PUBLIC OR BUSINESSES
THERE'S ALL SORTS OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT CAN USE THESE POOLS OF VERY FLEXIBLE PEOPLE POSSIBLY ALREADY
THEIR AVAILABILITY FOR WORK CAN BE SUCH THAT IT'S A FEW HOURS TODAY
WHAT PERCENTAGE ACTUALLY VOTED
WE GAVE YOUNG PEOPLE THE RIGHT TO VOTE 18 YEAR OLDS IN 1971 BUT THEN WE SYSTEMATICALLY DEFUNDED THEIR
NOW OF COURSE THERE ARE ISSUES THAT OVERLAP ACROSS AGE GROUPS THAT OLDER AND YOUNGER VOTERS AGREE ON
I FOUNDED AND DIRECT THE CALIFORNIA CIVIC ENGAGEMENT PROJECT HERE AT UC DAVIS
I WAS RAISED HERE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN CALIFORNIA
AND WE HAVE MANY NEGATIVE ATTITUDES ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE AND VOTING
YOU CAN ALSO TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES
YOUNG PEOPLE ARE HIGHLY MOBILE
THEY DON'T REACH OUT TO THEM IN ANY GIVEN ELECTION
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE ELIGIBLE TURNOUT RATE WAS FOR 18 TO 24 YEAR OLDS LAST NOVEMBER HERE IN
I'M A POLITICAL SOCIOLOGIST
AND I DO RESEARCH ON VOTING BEHAVIOUR
AND THAT STATISTIC IS BEARED OUT IN THE FACT THAT THERE'S LESS CRIME IN THE CITIES WHERE THERE'S MORE PORN WATCHED
I WANT YOU TO READ THE SURVEY THAT YOU HAVE AND I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT SOMEBODY NEXT TO YOU AND I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT HIM IN THE EYE AND
ALL THOSE LET'S SAY POLITICIANS WHO ARE SUDDENLY LOOKING FOR A LITTLE BOYS IN AIRPORT BATHROOMS
WE ARE ALLOWED TO DRAW OUR OWN BOUNDARIES
IT'S JUST NOT COOL
IN THE 16 STATES IN 2005 THAT INSTITUTED CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS SAYING THAT GAY MARRIAGE IS WRONG AND
THIS HURTS PEOPLE
THINK ABOUT THAT RIGHT
SO IT'S NOT THE STRAW THAT BREAKS THE CAMEL'S BACK
LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT IT
AND THEY'VE DONE IT ONCE
I WANT TO PLAY A LITTLE PIANO FOR YOU
YOU GET MENTAL IMAGES
YEAH IT'S RANDOM DISORGANIZED
BUT NOBODY COULD IMAGINE WHAT WAS COMING
HOW COULD ONE BOMB DESTROY AN ENTIRE CITY
HE'S THE DOUBLE SURVIVOR THEY CALL HIM
THEY WERE DOING SO MANY KINDS OF PROJECTS
I KIND OF FELT LIKE FORREST GUMP
HE TOLD HIS CO WORKERS WHAT HAPPENED
MY FATHER TAUGHT ME HOW TO BE ABOVE THAT
HE WAS A SHIP DESIGNER
HE WAS SEVERELY BURNT
AND SHE KNEW THAT SHE LIVED TOO BECAUSE OF IT
AND I MET THE JAPANESE LADY'S FAMILY AND I ASKED THEM IF THEY WOULD WORK WITH ME AND HELP ME WRITE THIS BOOK
SURE WE CAN DEMAND THAT OUR GOVERNMENTS HAVE HIGH LEVEL DISCUSSIONS TO ELIMINATE THE WEAPONS OF WAR BUT WE CAN COME
EIGHTY PERCENT OF RIKUZENTAKADA WAS WASHED AWAY
AND THAT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE ALSO BOTH A SECTIONS
IF YOU LISTEN TO IT AGAIN I THINK YOU MIGHT HEAR IT THIS WAY
BINARY BECAUSE IT HAS TWO BASIC PARTS TO IT
THEY ARE ALL RELATED TO EACH OTHER
AND IF YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE YOU KNOW THOSE CHANGES ARE GOING TO BE MEANINGFUL
SO WHY IS THIS SO HARD
AND HERE IT IS AGAIN SO YOU CAN GET FAMILIAR WITH IT BECAUSE IN A SECOND I'M GOING TO PLAY WITH IT
AND IN MUSIC THEORY WE CALL THIS A BINARY FORM
BUT THIS STUFF INTRODUCES A TON OF NEW STUFF
IT'S A VERY ANGRY SONG THAT'S SORT OF EXPLODING IN THE MIDDLE AND IT COLLAPSES THE STRUCTURE OF THE SONG
IT'S SORT OF EXPLODING IT'S STRETCHING OUT THE PIECE AND BY THE END THE STRUCTURE ENTIRELY FALLS APART
THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT I THINK MORE CHALLENGING BUT ALSO IN SOME WAYS MORE REWARDING
YOU CAN HAVE ONE THING GROW AND THEN BECOME THE BASIS OF AN ENTIRE SYMPHONY
WHAT YOU JUST HEARD WAS A STRUCTURE
ALL RIGHT SO MUSIC HAS STRUCTURE
AND IF YOU'RE FEELING REALLY GENEROUS TO THE CURE YOU CAN SAY
IN FACT YOU CAN HAVE 3 PARTS AND THAT'S A CLASSIC POP SONG
THE COMPOSER IS SAYING
I WISH THERE WERE A CHEAP FIX LIKE THAT
BUT THERE'S TWO KINDS OF BORING
AND I WOULD SUBMIT THAT CLASSICAL MUSIC IS THE SECOND KIND
THERE'S THE SORT OF VAGUE SENSE THAT IT'S GOOD FOR US AND WE SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE MORE OF IT BUT IT'S ALSO KIND OF BORING
BUT WE CAN REALLY APPLY THIS NOT ONLY TO CLASSICAL MUSIC BUT TO MODERN POP MUSIC AND ANYTHING YOU WANT TO DO
AND THAT IS ALSO WHY MUSIC REPEATS BECAUSE IT WANTS TO SHOW YOU THE STRUCTURE
BUT THIS WAS EASY RIGHT
ALCIDE WAS DRIVING AND HE WAS DRUNK AND HE DROVE OFF THE ROAD AND HIT A TELEGRAPH POLE
HE HAD NO UNDERSTANDING AT THAT TIME WHAT WAS GOING ON
NOW RICKY LIKE MY FATHER RICKY WAS A VERY INTELLIGENT GUY
I'LL EVEN TELL IT TO YOU NOW
BECAUSE WE'VE ALL BEEN PROGRAMMED
I WANTED TO KEEP MY FATHER HAPPY SO I SACRIFICED MY BIGGEST PASSION FOR PERFORMING TO BECOME A
I NEVER WANTED TO TALK ABOUT MY 30 YEARS WITH AN EATING DISORDER BECAUSE I WAS EMBARRASSED
BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO ANXIETY MOST OF US ACROSS THE GLOBE SHARE THE SAME TWO FEARS
YOU KNOW I CHANTED AFFIRMATIONS LIKE A MAD WOMAN
AND SHE SAID
PHYSICALLY SHE RECOILED
LOOKING FOR THE FUNNY IN THE FATAL WAS CERTAINLY MY SALVATION
HOW S YOUR HYPHEN
THEN ONCE YOU VE LEARNT TO BE KINDER TO YOURSELF YOU CAN LOOK FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO BE OF SERVICE TO
BUT TO SOMEONE WITH HIGH ANXIETY EVERY DAY CHALLENGES CAN SEEM LIKE A LIFE AND DEATH SITUATION
NO ONE IS PROMISED TOMORROW
THE FEAR THAT WE RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH AND THE FEAR THAT WE WON T HAVE ENOUGH
SELF ESTEEM IS GOOD
THEY COULDN T STOP AND SOMEHOW CAME TO TERMS WITH HIS PASSING MUCH MORE QUICKLY
I THINK ABOUT THAT WOMAN EVERY YEAR ON MY BIRTHDAY
MY OBSESSION WITH HELPING BEGAN FOR PURELY SELFISH REASONS
BUT MAYBE START WITH YOURSELF
SO THE BACTERIA THE FUNGI AND SO ON AND SO FORTH
BUT WE'VE COME UP WITH VERY CLEVER WAYS THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY DISCRIMINATE CAPTURE AND DISCRIMINATE THE MAMMOTH FROM THE NON
AND WHEN I BRING UP THIS WITH MY FRIENDS WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT
AND IT'S PROBABLY SURPRISING TO MANY OF YOU SITTING IN THIS ROOM THAT IT'S NOT THE TIME THAT MATTERS IT'S NOT
IF YOU WOULD ASK ME TEN YEARS AGO WETHER OR NOT WE WOULD EVER BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY SEQUENCE THE GENOME OF EXTINCT ANIMALS I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
WELL THAT IS NOT ACTUALLY THE CASE
AND THIS IS NOT AN UNCOMMON FEATURE IN PROBOSCIDEANS BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THAT LARGE SAVANNA MALE ELEPHANTS WILL
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY WERE INTERBREEDING
SO THIS LANDSCAPE WOULD BE EASILY ABLE TO HOUSE IT
WELL WHERE WOULD YOU PUT IT
IF YOU WOULD ASK WETHER OR NOT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO REVIVE AN EXTINCT SPECIES I WOULD HAVE SAID PIPE DREAM
WITH ADVANCES IN ANCIENT DNA TECHNOLOGY WE CAN ACTUALLY NOW START TO BEGIN TO SEQUENCE THE GENOMES OF THOSE
BUT I'LL ALSO GET ALL THE BACTERIA THAT ONCE LIVED WITH THE MAMMOTH AND MORE COMPLICATED I'LL GET ALL THE DNA
THEY BURY THEIR DEAD THEY EDUCATE THE NEXT OF KIN THEY HAVE SOCIAL KNITS THAT ARE VERY CLOSE
AND THERE THEY SURVIVED ON THE MAINLAND UNTIL ABOUT 10000 YEARS AGO AND ACTUALLY SURPRISINGLY ON THE SMALL
PROBABLY PLEISTOCENE OVERKILL SO THE LARGE GAME HUNTERS THAT TOOK THEM DOWN
UNLIKE THIS ONE AND CLICK CLICK THAT CONTENT APPEARS ON SCREENS ALL AROUND THE WORLD JUST LIKE THAT
I NEED A DOZEN BUTTONS I NEED TO DANCE AROUND THE ROOM
SO WE TAKE 3
AND YOUR NEXT PROJECT WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE MY ENCOURAGEMENT TO YOU IS IN WHATEVER INDUSTRY YOU WORK
I LOVE IT I USE IT EVERYDAY
IDEAS WORTH SPREADING
THAT SUMS IT UP PERFECTLY
I'VE GOT A CHOICE A AND B NOT ENOUGH CHOICES
I LOVE VIDEO GAMES
SOMETHING YOU CAN TEACH IN A SENTENCE OR LESS BUT WHICH ACTUAL EXPERTISE AT TAKES A LOT
I'M PLAYING A GAME I'VE GOT TO MAKE A DECISION
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE
5 MINUTES TO ROTATE THOSE PEOPLE A 180 DEGREES UNTIL THOSE BLAST DOORS THOSE HEAVY DOORS
AND THAT REAL LIFE TRAGIC EVENT DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE HAD ANY IMPACT ON PEOPLE'S
ONCE UPON A TIME YOU PROBABLY REMEMBER WHEN EDUCATION AND ENTERTAINMENT WERE ACTUALLY LOCATION BASED RIGHT
I LOVE MOVIES
I LOVE VIDEO GAMES
THESE ARE INCREDIBLE THINGS
IF KIDS DON'T KNOW THEY WILL CHOOSE A SNACK SHACK AND PANIC OVER
NOW THAT I'M OLDER AND MORE MATURE I WANT TO BE A POWERFUL VOICE IN FOOD ADVOCACY FOR MY
I LEARNED THAT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO RISK YOUR LIFE TO GET YOUR LIFE BACK
AND IT'S LIKE A MAGNET
AND WE GOT A HOLD OF THAT FAX
AND WOODY'S WAS TO DO WHAT WAS BEST FOR HIS CHILD
WHAT EXACTLY WAS IT
IT DOESN'T ALWAYS MEAN PLOT OR FACT
SOMETIMES IT'S AS SIMPLE AS ONCE UPON A TIME
DRAW FROM IT
AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT ALWAYS DROVE ALL HIS CHOICES
BUT UNDER THAT WAS THIS GLOBAL TENSION OF WILL WE EVER FIND NEMO IN THIS HUGE VAST OCEAN
IN THE SHORT TERM HAVE YOU MADE ME WANT TO KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT
YET THERE WAS SOMETHING MORE BEING SAID
AND IT WASN'T UNTIL ON ONE OF MY LATER VIEWINGS THAT THE VEIL WAS LIFTED AND IT WAS IN A SCENE WHERE HE'S WALKED ACROSS THE
USE WHAT YOU KNOW
SHE GAVE A WONDERFUL EXAMPLE OF MICHAEL CORLEONE AL PACINO'S CHARACTER IN THE GODFATHER AND THAT PROBABLY HIS
SO I WANTED TO BECOME MUCH BETTER AT IT AND LEARN ANYTHING I COULD
SO I RESEARCHED EVERYTHING I POSSIBLY COULD
AND WHEN AN ARTIST DOES THAT TO ANOTHER ARTIST IT'S LIKE YOU'RE COMPELLED TO PASS IT ON
GAVE IT MORE LOVE AND CARE THAN MY OWN CHILD
AND HE ORDERS A PINT AND THEY SIT IN SILENCE FOR A WHILE
YOU'VE GONE THROUGH HUNDREDS OF TV CHANNELS JUST SWITCHING CHANNEL AFTER CHANNEL AND THEN SUDDENLY YOU ACTUALLY
EVERYTHING LAWRENCE DID IN THAT MOVIE WAS AN ATTEMPT FOR HIM TO FIGURE OUT WHERE HIS PLACE WAS IN THE WORLD
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO
I'M GOING TO TRAVEL THE WORLD
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT'S GOING TO BE
WHAT SHE WAS KIND OF SAYING IS
THEY ARE MAYBE MAKING EIGHT NINE TEN DOLLARS AN HOUR
WE WASTE A LOT OF TIME
SO IN FACT WE WORK WITH VERY SPECIAL FLUORESCENT LABELS THAT WE CAN BY EXCITING THEM WITH
THIS WAS POPULAR IN THE 1800'S AND REALLY TALENTED PAINTERS COULD PAINT THESE
BUT NOW I WANT TO SPEAK ABOUT THIS PROBLEM
SO WE ARE ACTUALLY FOLLOWING THE MOTION OF THE VIRUS INSIDE THE CELL
AND THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE DOING WE ARE PUTTING TOGETHER DOTS
AND I HOPE I WAS ABLE TO SHOW YOU THAT WE ARE GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THAT DREAM
SO EVEN THOUGH WE CAN STILL DO QUITE A LOT AND LEARN A LOT OF INFORMATION FROM THESE BLURRY PIXELATED
AND FLUORESCENT LABELS WORK BEST FOR THESE
SO YOU WANT TO STUDY EACH VIRUS ONE AT A TIME
AND THESE THINGS ARE REALLY SMALL
MY FATHER WAS AN ALCOHOLIC AND LIFE AT HOME WAS OFTEN VERY TENSE
WHILE INTERROGATING MY JOURNEY THROUGH MEDICINE I ALSO SPOKE TO OTHER DOCTORS WHO HAD CHOSEN TO WALK AWAY
WAS IT ALL WASTED
MY WORLD NEARLY DID COLLAPSE WHEN MY BROTHER DIED WHEN I WAS 14 YEARS OLD
IT'S A POWERFUL ACT TO PUT YOUR HAND UP AND SAY I'M STRUGGLING
SOME DOCTORS CRACKED UNDER THE PRESSURE
I WAS BORN IN THE JOHANNESBURG TOWNSHIP OF SOWETO NOT FAR FROM HERE
THAT'S WHEN I HEARD HIM IN THE ROOM NEXT TO MINE
I TRIED TO TALK SOME SENSE INTO HIM
I EVEN SHOWED HIM WHERE I'D MADE MY NOTES IN HIS FOLDER
SO THERE ARE 1200 OF PEOPLE AT THIS TEDX EVENT
I THINK THAT THE NEXT TEACHER OR STUDENT THAT PARTICIPATES IN TED ED WILL BE TOO
BUT THE POINT IS THAT THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE WATCHED THIS VIDEO BECAUSE ELLEN'S DAD HAPPENS TO BE A
I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT BUT MY STAFF IS REALLY EXCITED TO WORK TOWARDS
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO INTO EACH OF THEM BUT THINK OF THAT SIDE MATERIAL THAT SIDEBAR AS AN
ONE DAY WHEN I WAS A SPECIAL EDUCATION HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER I WAS TEACHING A STUDY SKILLS CLASS
AND I'M GOING TO TELL YOU THREE STORIES ABOUT HOW THAT TOOL IS BEING USED IN THE WORLD
FIRST I WOULD HAVE CHANGED THE TITLE SO THAT IT RELATED TO MY CLASS
AND THEN I ALSO ASKED
AND THESE TWO DON'T CONTRADICT EACH OTHER
I'VE ANALYZED THE LANGUAGE OF PLATITUDES AND NOW I FIND MYSELF FACING THE
IT SEEMED TO BE ABOUT RIGHT BUT I COULDN'T QUITE TELL
AFTER 30 HOURS IN THE LAB I PROBABLY SMELLED HORRIBLE
THE NONHUMAN RIGHTS PROJECT ARGUES THAT DRAWING A LINE IN ORDER TO ENSLAVE AN AUTONOMOUS AND SELF DETERMINING BEING LIKE YOU'RE
THEY HAVE A SYMBOLIC CULTURE
AN ENRAGED CHARLES STEWART THEN HIRED SLAVE CATCHERS TO CANVASS THE CITY OF LONDON FIND HIM
WE KNOW THE EXTRAORDINARY COGNITIVE CAPABILITIES THAT THEY HAVE AND THEY ALSO RESEMBLE THE KIND THAT HUMAN BEINGS
THEY'RE TWO YOUNG MALE CHIMPANZEES WHO ARE BEING USED FOR BIOMEDICAL ANATOMICAL RESEARCH AT STONY BROOK
WE FOUND THEM
THEY DON'T COUNT IN LAW
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY LEGAL RIGHTS
AND SO ARE BOOKS YOU MIGHT HAVE OR THE CARS YOU OWN
EACH DREAM IS A SAUNTER THROUGH AN ENDLESS SANDBOX OUR OWN WILD WEST WITH NOTHING HOLDING US BACK
AND THIS IS JUST WHAT MAKES DREAMS SO INTERESTING SO EXCITING WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL HARNESSES
THROUGHOUT THESE AND THE MANY OTHER JOURNEYS THAT AWAIT THIS AFTERNOON WE INVITE YOU TO CONSIDER YOUR OWN DREAMS AS
TO ME DREAMS ARE THE WORLD'S MOST IMMERSIVE AND FANTASTIC MOVIES WITH PRIVATE SHOWINGS EVERY NIGHT
DREAMS LET US ESCAPE THE RESTRICTIONS OF OUR PHYSICAL WORLD
FOR A MOMENT I WANT YOU AS THE AUDIENCE TO THINK ON WHAT THIS OTHER TOPIC COULD BE
THERE'S YOUR PROOF THAT PROJECT BASED LEARNING CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE IF WE JUST MAKE THIS ONE
THAT'S RIGHT TEAMWORK
AND BECAUSE OF ALL THESE INTERACTIVE LESSONS I'VE ALMOST COME TO LOVE MATH
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE A FEW SECONDS TO THINK ABOUT
ADULTS HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS THEY HAVE TO COLLABORATE AND THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX
WHEN WE GET OLDER WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FACE THE STRUGGLE THAT IS WORKING WITH OTHERS
WHAT FUN IS THAT
TEAMWORK IS A VERY IMPORTANT ELEMENT TO PROJECT BASED LEARNING
BUT SOME OF YOU AT THIS TIME SOME OF YOU MIGHT BE THINKING WELL WHAT'S THE POINT OF ALL THIS
ALL RIGHT MOVING ON TO THE NEXT ONE
LET'S TAKE MATH FOR EXAMPLE A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE MATH EVEN THOUGH SOME LOVE IT
I WAS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE
BUT NOW THAT I'VE BEEN INTRODUCED TO PROJECT BASED LEARNING I FOUND MATH A LOT OF FUN
PEOPLE THINK THAT NOW THAT WE HAVE DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY THE BOOK IS GOING TO DIE AND
WILL IT BE THE SAME AS IT WAS THERE
IT HAD NO DANGER OF TURNING INTO THAT COUNTRY
THE CRASH WAS INEVITABLE
NO ECONOMY CAN GROW THAT FAST SAFELY
THEN IT WAS BECAUSE LATVIA WAS STRUGGLING FOR INDEPENDENCE AND THE FAITH OF THE SOVIET UNION HANG IN THE BALANCE
AN UNTREATED DIABETIC MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE AS MUCH AS 14 PERCENT
SO I DID THE N 1 EXPERIMENT
SO WHAT WOULD YOU DO
BUT THE ULTIMATE POWER IS YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE RIGHT
SO N MEANING JUST ONE SUBJECT RIGHT
AND WHILE MOST PEOPLE CAN TOLERATE A FAIR AMOUNT OF CARBOHYDRATE THERE MIGHT BE A CERTAIN AMOUNT
SO I REALLY BELIEVE IN KNOWLEDGE AND TRAINING
AND I HAD VERY NICE FLAT NORMAL BLOOD SUGARS
AND I KIND OF DO UNDERSTAND THE LINK BETWEEN CHOCOLATE AND LIVING BUT IN ANY CASE I WAS
SO I THOUGHT WHY NOT APPLY THAT CROWDSOURCED CLEANUP MODEL TO THE ENTIRE PLANET
WELL LET ME SHOW YOU
PLUS EVERY PHOTOGRAPH IS GEOTAGGED AND TIME STAMPED PROVIDING YOU WITH PROOF
HOW MIGHT THEY USE THIS DATA TO ALIGN THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC INTERESTS
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
BUT ONCE IN A WHILE CANCERS GET THE ABILITY TO EXPRESS THESE NEW SUGARS AND NOW THAT WE
WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT I HAVE TO LIVE UP TO MY OWN MISTAKES
THERE WAS ANOTHER OPTION
AND AS A CONSEQUENCE ACROSS THE WESTERN WORLD THE OVER SIMPLISTIC POLICIES OF THE PARTIES OF PROTEST AND THEIR APPEAL
IF WE WANT TO PROVIDE DECENT FULFILLING LIVES FOR OUR CHILDREN AND OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN WE NEED TO EXERCISE TO THE VERY GREATEST
THROUGHOUT THAT CAREER I NEVER ACCEPTED THAT A FILMMAKER SHOULD SET ABOUT PUTTING THEIR OWN WORK OUTSIDE OR ABOVE WHAT
THE CASE OF DONOGHUE VS
STEVENSON GLEN LANE PAISLEY
INDEED ONE WONDERS THAT WITHOUT A DUTY OF CARE HOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD HAVE HAD TO SUFFER FROM GASTROENTERITIS BEFORE STEVENSON
TABLOID NEWSPAPERS DO NOT APPEAR TO ADVANCE THE POLITICAL CITIZENSHIP OF THEIR READERS RELATIVE EVEN TO
THEY'RE NOT JUST LESS POLITICALLY ENGAGED
HOW COULD YOU WANT TO BE HERE
NO COURT DATES
YOU CAN SEE THIS AFFECT IN CHILDREN THAT ARE JUST TWO AND 1 2 YEARS OLD
BY SOME OF OUR FELLOW SPECIES INCLUDING PRAIRIE DOGS
YOU BECOME ABLE TO LOVE IN THIS WHOLE NEW WAY
THAT'S MY NEW JOB
HE IS A REALLY GOOD GUY
YOU BECOME ABLE TO LOVE OTHER PEOPLE RIGHT WHERE THEY ARE FOR WHO THEY ARE THE SAME WAY YOU'RE ALREADY
YOU KNOW THE ANSWER IS I AM STILL WORKING ON IT
AS I REFLECTED ON THE DATE AFTERWARDS I WAS LIKE WOW I GOT REALLY EXCITED
BECAUSE WHEN YOU MARRY YOURSELF THIS HUGE THING HAPPENS
AFTER THE COLLAPSE OF MY THIRD MARRIAGE IN 2005 I REALIZED THAT I'VE BEEN MARRYING EVERYONE IN
IT'S A BIG IDEA
WE STILL HAVE A WONDERFUL RELATIONSHIP
PEOPLE I INTERACTED WITH DAILY WORKED WITH WAS FRIENDS WITH FAMILY MEMBERS THAT I HAD KNOWN A LONG TIME HAD NEVER
SO I'M NOT GOING TO GO
BUT I THINK A LOT OF MEN DO GO THROUGH THIS SENSE IN THE EARLY MONTHS MAYBE THEIR FIRST YEAR THAT
AND I THINK WITH A DEATH YOU HAVE A FUNERAL YOU CELEBRATE THE LIFE AND THERE'S A LOT OF COMMUNITY SUPPORT AND IT'S SOMETHING
EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU SHOULD ABSOLUTELY NOT WORK WITH YOUR SPOUSE
I FELT LIKE I WAS A VESSEL OF THE FUTURE OF HUMANITY
AND SHE SAID I'LL NEVER FORGET IT'S JUST NOT SOMETHING YOU WANT TO SAY TO A MOTHER THAT'S HAVING A BABY FOR THE FIRST TIME
IT WAS IN THEORY AND HOPEFULLY IN PRACTICE A SMART ONLINE MAGAZINE ABOUT SEX AND
AND I WAS THERE WITH MY ARMS OPEN
AND THEN I REALIZED I HAD TO FIGURE OUT WHO HIS NEXT OF KIN WAS AND ASK THEM AND IT TURNED OUT IT WAS ANDRE WATERS'S 88 YEAR OLD
AND SO WHAT I STARTED WAS A BRAIN DONATION REGISTRY
HE WAS KNOWN FOR LEADING WITH HIS HEAD SO I THOUGHT I'M JUST GOING TO LOOK UP DID HE EVER TALK ABOUT THE CONCUSSIONS HE HAD
WE WANT TO KNOW WHY HE CHANGED SO MUCH IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS OF HIS LIFE
WE'VE ALSO BEEN LUCKY TO HAVE PEOPLE LIKE BRANDI CHASTAIN THE WOMEN'S SOCCER ICON NASCAR'S DALE EARNHARDT JR
BUT IF YOU DO GET THE PERMISSION OF HIS NEXT OF KIN I WILL RELEASE THE BRAIN TO YOU
AND IT TURNED OUT THEY BOTH HAD IT
FORMER PHILADELPHIA EAGLES STRONG SAFETY 44 YEARS OLD A DIVISION II FOOTBALL COACH WHEN HE DECIDED TO PUT A
IN THE ARTICLE THEY REMINDED ME HIS NICKNAME WAS DIRTY WATERS
MY COLLEAGUES TAL YARKONI AND RUSS POLDRACK HAVE SHOWN THAT THE INSULA POPS UP IN ALMOST A
MAYBE SOMEDAY WE WILL BUT UNTIL THEN WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL THAT WE DON'T LET OVERBLOWN CLAIMS DETRACT
BUT THE PROMISE OF NEUROSCIENCE HAS LED TO SOME REALLY HIGH EXPECTATIONS AND SOME
A LOT OF PEOPLE AGREE
ASK FOR THE PART OF THE STORY THAT'S NOT BEING TOLD
NOW THERE'S JUST ONE PROBLEM WITH THIS LINE OF REASONING AND THAT'S THAT THE INSULA DOES A LOT
BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT THIS KIND OF THING HAPPENS ALL THE TIME AND IT AFFECTS NOT JUST THE
SO I WENT TO THE COMPANY'S WEBSITE LOOKING TO FIND SOME CONTROLLED TRIALS OF THEIR PRODUCTS
LIKE JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO NEUROSCIENTISTS AT MIT FIGURED OUT HOW TO BREAK HABITS IN
WE DID OUR BEST TO FIND REASONS TO LAUGH
AND I THINK THAT'S A REALLY DAMAGING AND DANGEROUS NARRATIVE THAT WE HAVE THAT ALLOWS THESE TYPES OF THINGS TO HAPPEN
WE SPOKE THROUGH THESE HANDSETS ATTACHED TO THE WALL AND TALKED ABOUT BOOKS AND MOVIES
HOW COULD THIS POSSIBLY BE HAPPENING
THEIR TREATMENT IS A REFLECTION OF THE VALUES HELD BEYOND PRISON WALLS
LIKE OTHER CMU PRISONERS MCGOWAN REPEATEDLY ASKED FOR AN ANSWER A HEARING OR SOME
AND I WAS APPROVED
AND THEY SAID THAT IF I ATTEMPTED TO INTERVIEW MCGOWAN THE VISIT WOULD BE TERMINATED
THEY ACCEPT THAT IT ACTUALLY PROBABLY ISN'T AND DO IT ANYWAY
THEY WANT TO I'M SURE LIKE MANY OF YOU HELP THE WORLD DO SOMETHING TO HELP PEOPLE
SECOND TO EMBODY
A NUMBER OF MY CLIENTS COME TO ME AND THEY'RE LOOKING EXTERNALLY FOR A VISION
AND IT HAS A TWO FOLD MEANING
AND THESE PEOPLE THAT I WAS WORKING WITH WAS VARIOUSLY CONSUMED WITH TWO TERMS
WHAT THEY WANTED TO CREATE IN THE WORLD
I DIDN'T SAY GOODBYE TO ANYBODY NOT MY MOTHER MY FATHER MY SISTERS MY BROTHERS MY AUNTS MY UNCLES MY COUSINS MY
I FOUND ALL OF MY FAMILY IN MY ADULT LIFE
I HADN'T DONE ANYTHING WRONG
SO THIS WAS AN OPPORTUNITY
I WASN'T CHARGED FOR ANYTHING
I MEAN THE CHILD OF THE STATE
I SAW LIGHT
I DON'T MEAN CHILDREN
I HAVE TO TELL IT BECAUSE THERE WAS NO ONE TO PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER
THIS WAS AN OPPORTUNITY
MARGARET THATCHER WAS MY MOTHER
THE MOTHER AND BABY'S HOMES WERE OFTEN RUN BY NUNS
I WAS STARTING TO STAY OUT A LITTLE BIT LATE ETC
HE SIGNED A PROMISE TO HELP THE PEOPLE OF BALI SAY NO TO PLASTIC BAGS
AND WE ARE NOW FRIENDS AND ON A REGULAR BASIS WE REMIND HIM AND HIS TEAM OF THE PROMISES HE HAS MADE
IF YOU'RE A FELLOW ROTARIAN NICE TO MEET YOU
WE WENT TO INDIA TO GIVE A TALK AND OUR PARENTS TOOK US TO VISIT THE FORMER PRIVATE HOUSE OF MAHATMA GANDHI
ALL WE WANTED TO DO WAS STOP THOSE PLASTIC BAGS FROM WRAPPING AND SUFFOCATING OUR BEAUTIFUL HOME
AND THEY PROVIDE JOBS AND MEDICINE AND FOOD INCLUDING 20 PERCENT OF
WELL TODAY I'M GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT A SERIOUS REALITY THAT IS CHANGING OUR OCEANS CALLED
THE LINE ON THE BOTTOM SHOWS THEN SHOWS THE CHANGE IN CHEMISTRY
SO WE START AT THE BOTTOM WHICH CAN BE OVER FOUR KILOMETERS DEEP JUST OFF OUR CONTINENTAL SHELF AND WE TAKE
THEY MODERATE OUR CLIMATE
I'M GOING TO QUIT MY JOB
BUT HIS CONVERSATIONS WITH THE PATIENT WERE EXACTLY WHAT A PATIENT MIGHT WANT
I WRITE ABOUT THESE CONVERSATIONS
I'M GOING TO MOVE IN WITH MY PARENTS
BRIMMING WITH CONFIDENCE
WHAT WILL YOU TELL THEM
THESE CONVERSATIONS ARE TERRIBLY FRAUGHT
THIS IS HOW SCIENCE LEARNS
HE CAN THEN WEAR A PROSTHETIC AND RUN AND JUMP AND PLAY
BUT WE DIDN'T LEARN ABOUT IT FROM COMMON CANCERS
THE SAME SONG CAN AFFECT DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT WAYS
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
AND LIKE I SAID I WAS FASCINATED WITH THE MOON THE NIGHT SKY BUT I WAS ACTUALLY
WE STARTED PLAYING MUSIC AROUND THE SAME TIME
WHEN I WAS 21 I WAS ABLE TO GO AND STUDY WITH THE GREAT SPANISH MASTER ANDR S SEGOVIA IN
I WAS TRANSPORTED
AND I SAID WHAT
AND AT THE SAME TIME I WAS LOOKING ON THE INTERNET PEOPLE WERE REALLY EXPERIMENTING WITH YOUTUBE VIDEOS AND TAKING RECORDINGS AND MAKING
WHAT MAKES MARKETS WORK
SO I WENT AND I INTERVIEWED HIM AND I RECORDED THIS CONVERSATION THAT I HAD WITH HIM
HE DIDN'T WAIT AROUND FOR THE PRESS RELEASE
HE DIDN'T WAIT AROUND FOR THE REPORTER TO COME CALLING
THERE ARE SO MANY QUESTIONS THAT WE STILL DON'T KNOW
SO WHAT'S THE OTHER 95
HOW DO WE CURE IT
WHAT IS GRAVITY
THERE ARE OTHER SPECIES
DIED UNFORTUNATELY 2 DAYS LATER
ONE IS THE MITOCHONDRIAL GENOME AND THE MITOCHONDRIA ARE THE ORGANELLES IN THE CELL THAT MAKE ENERGY
THAT WOULD BE VERY EMBARRASSING
AND THAT'S HAPPENED BEFORE
THIS WAS LONG BEFORE WE HAD THE RESEARCH KNOW HOW AND EVEN THE TECHNOLOGY TO BE ABLE TO PROVE THAT
AND ASK YOURSELF THE QUESTION
WE'RE ALL STARTING TO WEAR FITBITS PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO TAKE NOTICE OF THEIR OWN HEALTH
THEY ARE ANTI INFLAMMATORY
IS THIS A REAL POSSIBILITY
WILL YOUR HEALTH INSURER BE DICTATING WHAT YOU EAT AND WILL FOOD NO LONGER BECOME A CHOICE BUT RATHER A WAY
ARE SAYING THAT THEY SPEND THREE OUT OF EVERY FOUR DOLLARS IN PAYOUTS FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC DISEASE
WE NOW HAVE TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL MEASURE AND MONITOR OUR OWN HEALTH AND GIVE US SOME INFORMATION AND FEEDBACK
BUT THE WAY IN WHICH YOUR BODY SEES THESE BACTERIA AND VIRUSES IS THE SAME WAY THAT IT CAN SEE AND RECOGNIZE
THESE FUNCTIONAL FOODS HAVE BEEN A REVELATION FOR FOOD MANUFACTURERS EVERYWHERE BECAUSE THEY'VE SHOWN THAT
WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THESE FOODS
HOW HAVE THESE FOODS CHANGED
SO THE SALE OF TRANS FAT ALTERNATIVES WENT THROUGH THE ROOF DURING THIS DECADE
REMEMBER THE SECOND STRATEGY FINANCIALIZATION
SO THAT WAS A PROBLEM
BUT THEN WHAT CAME IN
SO THE MONEY IS JUST A TOOL
YOU HAD TO DO THAT IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO PUSH DOWN SALARIES AS MUCH AS THEY DID
SO ALL OF A SUDDEN BANKS COULD LEND AS MUCH AS THEY WANTED THEY COULD HAVE AS HIGH
WATSON WAS IN FACT LISTENING TO VERY LOW FREQUENCY RADIO EMISSIONS CAUSED BY NATURE
IN THE SECULAR WORLD WE THINK IF AN IDEA IS IMPORTANT I'LL BUMP INTO IT
THERE'S SO MUCH WE CAN ABSORB
NOW THINK ABOUT RELIGIONS THINK ABOUT ORGANIZED RELIGIONS
I THINK THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE
SIT THEM IN A CLASSROOM TELL THEM ABOUT PLATO AT THE AGE OF 20 SEND THEM OUT FOR A CAREER IN MANAGEMENT CONSULTANCY FOR 40 YEARS
ART SHOULD BE ONE OF THE TOOLS BY WHICH WE IMPROVE OUR SOCIETY
PERHAPS THIS IS JUST ME MAYBE YOU
NONSENSE SAYS THE RELIGIOUS WORLD VIEW
WHY DON'T WE
THEY GROUP TOGETHER THEY FORM INSTITUTIONS
THE NEW IS BETTER THAN THE OLD
AND THE MOON AND THE REFLECTION ON THE MOON WILL HAVE A SECURE PLACE IN YOUR HEART
ART IS ABOUT TWO THINGS IN ALL THE MAJOR FAITHS
AND CORPORATIONS ARE VERY LIKE RELIGIONS IN MANY WAYS EXCEPT THEY'RE RIGHT DOWN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PYRAMID OF NEEDS
THEY SAID WHERE ARE PEOPLE GOING TO FIND THE MORALITY WHERE ARE THEY GOING TO FIND GUIDANCE AND WHERE ARE THEY GOING TO FIND
AND THEY DON'T REALLY CHANGE MUCH
A LOT OF OUR SURPLUS WEALTH GOES TO MUSEUMS ETC
AFTER EVERY CONVINCING POINT PEOPLE WILL GO AMEN AMEN AMEN
I THINK IT'S TOO EASY TO DISMISS THE WHOLE OF RELIGION THAT WAY
AND THEY SAY SO AREN'T YOU SORT OF RELIGIOUS
WE RECOGNIZE THEM IN RELATION TO CORPORATIONS
AND SECONDLY IT'S TRYING TO REMIND YOU OF WHAT THERE IS TO FEAR AND TO HATE
YOU WON'T DO THAT BY ACCIDENT YOU WILL DO THAT BECAUSE YOU ARE GUIDED TO DO THAT
WE THINK OF HITLER WE THINK OF STALIN
AND THAT'S REALLY THE SPIRIT OF MY TALK
THEY DON'T THINK WE NEED IT
I'LL JUST COME ACROSS IT
AND FOR ME ATHEISM 2
I'VE SKETCHED A SORT OF BROAD FRAMEWORK
I DON'T THINK WE HAVE TO MAKE THAT CHOICE
WE ASSOCIATE REPETITION WITH BOREDOM
WHATEVER IT MAY BE YOU KNOW THE KIND OF THING I'M TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE ATTRACTED TO THE
ART SHOULD BE DIDACTIC
AND THAT HAS ALL SORTS OF ADVANTAGES
ESSENTIALLY IT'S PROPAGANDA
YOU'VE HEARD THAT SAYING
WE HAVE SECULARIZED BADLY I WOULD ARGUE
AND I SAY OF COURSE
AND INFLUENTIAL VOICES CAME UP WITH ONE ANSWER
SO RELIGIONS ARE CULTURES OF REPETITION
JEWS ARE VERY INTERESTED IN FORGIVENESS AND HOW WE SHOULD START ANEW AND START AFRESH
NOW I THINK THAT'S A VERY BEAUTIFUL IDEA AND A VERY TRUE IDEA
AND YOU WOULD GO AMEN AMEN AMEN
IF YOU SAID TO A MODERN LIBERAL INDIVIDUALIST HEY HOW ABOUT A SERMON
IT SETS THINGS INTO PERSPECTIVE ETC
YOU'LL BE HANDED RICE CAKES
WHAT DO ORGANIZED RELIGIONS DO
I DON'T NEED ONE OF THOSE
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME VERY VOCAL ATHEISTS WHO'VE POINTED OUT NOT JUST THAT RELIGION IS
AND THAT'S WHAT ART IS
SO IN ORTHODOX JEWISH COMMUNITIES EVERY FRIDAY YOU GO TO A MIKVEH
OF COURSE THERE ARE NO DEITIES OR SUPERNATURAL SPIRITS OR ANGELS ETC
I REALLY LIKE TURNING THE PAGES OF THE OLD TESTAMENT
THEY HAVE NO TROUBLE TELLING US WHAT ART IS ABOUT
LET'S LOOK TO THE PLAYS OF SHAKESPEARE THE DIALOGUES OF PLATO THE NOVELS OF JANE AUSTEN
WE'RE ONLY JUST HOLDING IT TOGETHER
ART IS A VISCERAL ENCOUNTER WITH THE MOST IMPORTANT IDEAS OF YOUR FAITH
AND WHEN THEY TEACH US A LESSON THEY DO IT VIA THE BODY
NOW WE DON'T THINK THAT WAY
NOW THE WORD PROPAGANDA SETS OFF ALARM BELLS
NOT SO IF YOU'RE ADOPTING A RELIGIOUS MINDSET
THEY'RE SELLING US SHOES AND CARS
THE OTHER THINGS THAT RELIGIONS DO IS TO ARRANGE TIME
AND I GO NO
SO AS YOU WALK AROUND A CHURCH OR A MOSQUE OR A CATHEDRAL WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO IMBIBE WHAT YOU'RE IMBIBING IS THROUGH YOUR
SO FOR EXAMPLE TAKE THE JEWISH IDEA OF FORGIVENESS
NOW ART IS SOMETHING THAT IN THE SECULAR WORLD WE THINK VERY HIGHLY OF
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE RELIGIOUS WARS OF LATE HAVE IGNORED
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SERMON AND OUR MODERN SECULAR MODE OF DELIVERY THE LECTURE
JEROME AND HIS QUALITIES OF HUMILITY AND GOODNESS AND HIS GENEROSITY TO THE POOR
YOU KNOW IN THE 18TH CENTURY IN THE U
FIRST OF ALL SCALE MIGHT
THEY TELL US TO HAVE A BATH
THEY SAID CULTURE
DAVIS AND FIGURED OUT HOW TO RAISE BEES IN FRONT OF A CAMERA
WE USED TO RELY ON NEWS ORG SUCH AS THE AP AFP REUTERS
NOT THIS TIME
BECAUSE BARACK WON BY SUCH LAST MARGIN THAT IT DIDN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE
EASTERN EUROPE IS INTEGRATED INTO WESTERN EUROPE TO THE POINT WHERE THE CONCEPT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
AGAIN THIS IS NOT
COUNTRIES WHICH ARE A BIT WEIRD A BIT DIFFERENT IT'S EASTERN EUROPE IT'S ALMOST USED AS A TERM
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE EURO
ROMA IS A TERRIBLE EUROPEAN SOCIAL PROBLEM
THE CREDIT RATINGS ARE GOING UP
NO WORRIES ABOUT WEIRD EXTREMIST PARTIES
AND THAT'S KIND OF TRUE
MAKE IT HALF A TRILLION
HE'S VERY CORRUPT HE'S IN WITH ORGANIZED CRIME
A COUNTRY WHICH PEOPLE JUST WROTE OFF AS ANOTHER EAST EUROPEAN BASKET CASE
AND IF WE MAKE CATEGORIES MAKE THEM REAL ONES WITH REAL COMMON CHARACTERISTICS
THE FOOD WAS REALLY BAD IT WAS LIKE EAST EUROPEAN
SO EVEN THEN IT WAS A PRETTY UNTIDY CONCEPT
BUT IT SORT OF MADE SENSE
WESTERN EUROPE BASICALLY FREE EASTERN EUROPE BASICALLY NOT
LET'S DEAL WITH THE COUNTRIES OF EUROPE AS THEY ARE
AND SO SHE HAD NEVER MET THEM BEFORE NEVER TALKED TO THEM BEFORE NEVER GOTTEN THE CHANCE TO KNOW THEIR
SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT MY BROTHER
THIS REALLY IS WORTH WORKING ON
WHY WOULD THIS KIND OF THING NOT WORK FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE EVEN MORE THINGS TO MANAGE
BUT IF WE ARE ABLE TO SHARE INFORMATION IN A WAY THAT RESPECTS MICHAEL'S PRIVACY
IN FACT I KNOW OF MULTIPLE CASES WHERE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PICKED UP BECAUSE THEY WERE IN
ALL HE KNEW WAS HE HAD TO FIND A PLACE TO SLEEP AND TO GET TO HIS FIRST PAROLE APPOINTMENT IN A COUPLE OF
OF COURSE WHEN HE TOLD HIS PAROLE OFFICER THAT HE LOST HIS JOB WELL THEN SHE WAS REALLY
SO THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY READY TO GO
IF WE START NOW WE CAN BE READY FOR THE NEXT EPIDEMIC
WE'VE GOT CELL PHONES TO GET INFORMATION FROM THE PUBLIC AND GET INFORMATION OUT TO THEM
THE LAST TIME A GERM GAME WAS DONE IN THE UNITED STATES WAS BACK IN 2001 AND IT DIDN'T GO SO WELL
WE HAVE SATELLITE MAPS WHERE WE CAN SEE WHERE PEOPLE ARE AND WHERE THEY'RE MOVING
NO ONE TO LOOK AT THE DIAGNOSTICS
AND THAT WAS JUST LUCK
THE SOURCE OF THE VIRUS COULD BE A NATURAL EPIDEMIC LIKE EBOLA OR IT COULD BE BIOTERRORISM
FINDING OF FACT ONE
MY CLIENT IS HUMAN
BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHY OLIVER FELT SO ISOLATED WHEN HE COULDN'T WEAR WHAT HE WANTED TO WEAR
CLOTHING CAN BE TRANSFORMATIVE
AND SO I DID
HE WAS ABLE TO GET DRESSED ON HIS OWN HE WAS ABLE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM ON HIS OWN THOSE JEANS
I THOUGHT WE WERE KINDRED CRAZY HAIR SPIRITS TOGETHER
I BELIEVED THAT I JUST NEEDED TO EDUCATE THE INDUSTRY OF THE
MAGNETS MADE OUR HARVARD FRESHMAN ABLE TO WEAR JEANS ON CAMPUS BECAUSE HE COULD DRESS
CAN YOU IMAGINE THE TIME AND MONEY SHE SPENT
THE MISSION WAS TO EDUCATE THE FASHION INDUSTRY THAT MODIFICATIONS COULD BE MADE TO
I KNEW THAT IF I WAS GOING TO MAKE A CHANGE IN THE INDUSTRY I HAD TO USE MY BACKGROUND
THERE'S ACTUALLY A PROFESSOR IN THE UK BY THE NAME OF KAREN J
FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS HE WOULD WEAR PROPER PANTS
BUT THEM I SAID OH PLEASE
THERE'S NOTHING I HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE
NOW ENTROPY IS A COMPLICATED TERM BUT BASICALLY IT MEASURES THE STRENGTH OF PASSWORDS
AND SO WE NEVER ACTUALLY SAW ANYBODY'S PASSWORD
AND THAT CREATED INCENTIVES FOR PEOPLE TO INNOVATE
HOW DOES GREECE FIT INTO THIS
LET ME SAY THAT THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE AND THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON IN MEXICO IN NORTH KOREA AND ZIMBABWE
DOES GREECE HAVE POLITICIANS LIKE THAT
AND THROUGH OWNING A MONOPOLY A TELECOMMUNICATIONS MONOPOLY
TO UNDERMINE THE STRONG STATE
AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT BOTH OF THESE EXAMPLES BOTH OF THESE ELEMENTS COME IN
OR HOW COME MEXICO IS LIKE THAT
THE WAY I'M TALKING NOW IS SORT OF POLITICS
I DON'T LIKE YOUR FACE
I'M GOING TO CALL THAT EXTRACTIVE ECONOMIC INSTITUTIONS
SO HOW COME THE UNITED STATES ENDED UP LIKE THAT
IT STOPPED PEOPLE FROM COPYING HIS IDEA
I AM GOING TO TALK ABOUT WHY NATIONS FAIL AND WHY NATIONS SUCCEED AS WELL WHICH IS REALLY
I MEAN COME ON
THE ENGINEERS HAVE A PROBLEM
WE SOLVED THAT PROBLEM LAST WEEK
WE WROTE A COMPACTION ROUTINE THAT REDUCES THE SIZE OF ALL FONTS BY AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE
YOU CAN HAVE AS MANY FONTS ON YOUR SYSTEM AS YOU LIKE
WE HAD NO PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF THIS ISM SO ONCE WE LEARNED ABOUT ABLEISM WE REALIZED THAT WERE A LOT OF THINGS WHICH WE DO
IT WAS DURING THIS TOPIC THAT I REALIZED THAT I NEED TO STOP WORRYING ABOUT HOW I'M AFFECTED AND START TAKING INTO ACCOUNT
IN ORDER TO EMPATHETIC YOU UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION THAT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN THROUGH BUT WHEN YOU ARE SYMPATHETIC YOU TRY TO MAKE THAT
WIMPS ARE AN EXAMPLE FOR THE SO CALLED COLD DARK MATTER WHICH MEANS THAT UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF GRAVITY THEY
SO WE HAVE TO SURROUND THE XENON BY VARIOUS SHIELDS
BUT I'VE COME HERE TODAY BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE STAND FOR
AND THAT IS OUR HONOR CODE
AND ABOUT 42000 PEOPLE DIED FROM SECOND HAND SMOKE
THEY HAVE ALL SAID THAT THEY DO NOT WANT ALTRIA'S MONEY AND THAT ALTRIA'S IDENTITY DOES NOT ALIGN WITH
OTHERS HAVE SAID THAT THIS IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE WHERE DO YOU DRAW THE LINE BETWEEN THE COMPANIES THAT YOU
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS PASSION
AND THEN WE HELP THEM TO GO AND FIND THE KNOWLEDGE BECAUSE NOBODY IN THE WORLD CAN SUCCEED
THE TWO WORDS COME FROM THE LATIN ROOT PATER WHICH MEANS FATHER
YOU CAN GIVE SOMEBODY AN IDEA
CAN YOU LOOK AFTER THE MONEY
CAN YOU HELP US
WHAT CAN YOU DO
WE MEET AT THE PUB
BUT INSTEAD OF ASKING THEM HOW COME THEY WERE NOT
IN ZAMBIA TO THIS SIZE
YOU SHOULD SEE THE RUBBISH THAT WE HAVE BESTOWED ON UNSUSPECTING AFRICAN PEOPLE
I SAID THAT'S NICE
EVERYBODY IS WORKING ON THAT
HE SAID NO NO NO THE SCHOOL
HE GETS AUTOMATIC PAYMENT ON HIS MOBILE PHONE FROM THIS INSURANCE COMPANY
YOU SEEM TO BE VERY HAPPY HE SAID LIKE YEAH YEAH YEAH MY DAUGHTER PASSED AN EXAM
SO YOUR WIFE KEEPS YOU UP TO DATE WITH WHAT'S GOING ON
FORTY MILLION PEOPLE ARE THERE
SORRY FOR THE WORDS
SO HOW DO THEY GET PEOPLE MONEY
WE WILL DOMINATE EVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY IS GOING TO PAY THROUGH THEIR PHONES
I KNOW EVERYTHING
FULL STOP NOW
YOU HAVE TO KNOW HE IS WORKING TWO MONTHS SEVEN DAYS A WEEK THEN HE GETS TWO WEEKS OFF
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME HERE
BUT IT WAS REALLY GREAT
WE SAW ALL THE ANIMALS
IT'S HARDWIRED IN OUR BRAINS
IT'S ALREADY VERY CLOSE TO US
WHEN WE WALKED THROUGH THE SAVANNA A THOUSAND YEARS AGO WE MADE LINEAR PREDICTIONS WHERE THAT ANIMAL WOULD BE AND THAT WORKED FINE
AND THE PROJECT WAS FINISHED ON TIME
WHAT NOW FITS IN OUR POCKETS WOULD FIT IN A BLOOD CELL IN 25 YEARS
AND I WAS ASKED WELL AREN'T YOU NERVOUS
AND THAT REALLY DESCRIBES INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
WHEN I WAS A STUDENT AT MIT WE ALL SHARED ONE COMPUTER THAT TOOK UP A WHOLE BUILDING
WE'LL SEE THE SAME THING IN THE ECONOMIC RECESSION WE'RE HAVING NOW
SO WHAT I WAS DOING IT WAS LIKE A BLESSING IN DISGUISE
SO THESE SAME WOMEN NOW HAVE A LITTLE BUSINESS
THE MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL WILL WE DISAPPOINT THESE PEOPLE
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS CALL FOR 20 YEARS
I WOULD HAVE PAID TO DO THIS PROJECT
AND I THINK WE HAVE A TENDENCY TO NOT BE CLEAR ABOUT THIS TO TRY TO MOVE OUR INNER TRUTHS TO OUTER
SO I'M TALKING HERE ABOUT OUTER TRUTH ABOUT OBJECTIVE THINGS
IT WILL COME AS NO SURPRISE TO YOU THAT THE MAJORITY OF VOTERS IN AMERICA ARE WHITE
WE HAVE FOUGHT TO BE HERE
YOUNG PEOPLE I HAD WORKED WITH WERE BEING HARASSED NOT JUST BY CLASSMATES BUT ALSO BY THEIR
AND WHEN PEOPLE LIKE LAN ARE SITTING AT THE POLICY TABLE THEY CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE
IT'S NOT JUST MY WORK
AND IT'S THESE THREE THINGS IMMIGRANTS' VOTES VOICES AND VANTAGE POINTS THAT I THINK CAN HELP
SO IN 2000 WHEN IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT THE CITIZENSHIP APPLICATION FEE WAS GOING TO MORE THAN
TWO THINGS HAPPENED AS WE COPED WITH LOSS AND RECOVERY IN NEW YORK CITY
PEOPLE WHO WERE MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY YOUNG PEOPLE I HAD WORKED WITH WERE EXPERIENCING
EVEN MORE EXCITING
PERHAPS I HAVE TO WORK HARDER AT FINDING A RITUAL WHICH MATTERS FOR ME AND GOING BACK INTO MY PAST TO SEE WHERE
YOU MUST KNOW ABOUT IT
PERHAPS PART OF THIS JOURNEY IS ABOUT ME TRYING TO FIND OUT WHERE I BELONGED
THEN WE RESPECT
HOW DO I KNOW WHO TED IS
WHERE AM I FROM
I SAID BUT WHO'S TED
AND NO NO THE TED GROUP
WE FIRST CAPTURED THE DYNAMICS WITH A SET OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
THE FIRST IS THAT GRAVITY ACTS ON ALL OBJECTS IN THE SAME WAY
I WATCHED HOW SHE WAS AND I LOVED JUST HOW ACCOMPLISHED SHE WAS AND MY PARENTS
WHEN THE HEART SAYS I DON'T KNOW THEN IT'S TIME TO WAIT
THAT IS IN FACT WHAT THE GROUPS WHO MANAGE TO ESTABLISH RELATIONSHIPS THAT ARE MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL DO DIFFERENTLY
THERE ARE 6000 EDIBLE WILD PLANTS
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO ALL THIS STUFF
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO AMEND THE SOIL YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO WATER THEM SO THAT SUITED ME FINE
LIKE I NOTICE GARY YOU HAVE SOME NICE AMARANTH IN THAT WEED SLIDE
AND PARTICIPATING IN THE NURTURING OF THE PLANET
SHARPEN YOUR QUILL
HOW NATURE WORKS IS SUNBEAMS COME DOWN IT'S CAPTURED BY PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND CONVERTED
HOW DO WE DUPLICATE THAT IF WE HAVE A SYSTEM OF PRIVATE LAND OWNERSHIP AND ALL THAT
COULD WE ENGINEER NEW WAYS OF MOURNING NEW RITUALS FOR REMEMBERING
JUST KNOWING MY ROOMMATES WERE IN THE SAME HOUSE MADE ME UNCOMFORTABLE
BUT AFTER A COUPLE OF YEARS JUST WRITING SONGS WASN'T ENOUGH
WE HAVE A BUFFER OF TIME AND SPACE BETWEEN US AND THE PEOPLE WHOSE IDEAS WE FIND SO FRUSTRATING
MY MOM SAID SOMETHING TO ME A FEW WEEKS BEFORE I LEFT WESTBORO WHEN I WAS DESPERATELY HOPING THERE
ASSUMING ILL MOTIVES ALMOST INSTANTLY CUTS US OFF FROM TRULY UNDERSTANDING WHY SOMEONE DOES AND BELIEVES AS
ESCALATING DISGUST AND INTRACTABLE CONFLICT ARE NOT WHAT WE WANT FOR OURSELVES OR OUR COUNTRY OR OUR
WE EVEN TARGET PEOPLE ON OUR OWN SIDE WHEN THEY DARE TO QUESTION THE PARTY LINE
ONCE I SAW THAT WE WERE NOT THE ULTIMATE ARBITERS OF DIVINE TRUTH BUT FLAWED HUMAN BEINGS I COULDN'T PRETEND
THEY TREATED US LIKE FAMILY
THIS HAS BEEN AT THE FRONT OF MY MIND LATELY BECAUSE I CAN'T HELP BUT SEE IN OUR PUBLIC DISCOURSE SO MANY OF THE
SHE HAS A HUGE IMAGINATION
KIDS DON'T PLAN THINGS OUT
ADULTS PLAN OUT EVERY LITTLE SECOND OF THEIR DAY BEFORE IT HAPPENS
DO YOU EVER WONDER WHY
IMAGINE LADY LIBERTY THE BLINDFOLDED WOMAN HOLDING THE SCALE MEANT TO SYMBOLIZE THE BALANCE IN
ONCE WE HAD FOLLOWED OUR MEN ALL THE WAY INTO THEIR 80S WE WANTED TO LOOK BACK AT THEM AT
THE PEOPLE WHO WERE THE MOST SATISFIED IN THEIR RELATIONSHIPS AT AGE 50 WERE THE HEALTHIEST
BUT OVER AND OVER OVER THESE 75 YEARS OUR STUDY HAS SHOWN THAT THE PEOPLE WHO FARED THE
MOST OF WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT HUMAN LIFE WE KNOW FROM ASKING PEOPLE TO REMEMBER THE
THEY ALL FINISHED COLLEGE DURING WORLD WAR II AND THEN MOST WENT OFF TO SERVE IN THE WAR
AND WHEN ABOUT A DECADE AGO WE FINALLY ASKED THE WIVES IF THEY WOULD JOIN US AS MEMBERS OF THE STUDY
I THINK MY FAVORITE ONE IS ABOUT A FRIEND WHO TOOK A TRIP TO PANAMA
HE COULD SAY
I MEAN I'M IN COLLEGE HE'S IN COLLEGE
WE BOTH HAVE SCHEDULES THIS IS OUR WEEKEND AND OTHER PEOPLE WANT OUR TIME TOO
SO I'M HERE TO FIND ANOTHER TOPIC AND I'M GOING TO CALL IT INTENTIONAL CONVERSATION
SOMEBODY'S GOING TO BUILD AN IRON FOUNDRY
OR WE MAY GET THERE A LONG TIME BEFORE NASA BUT NASA HAS TAKEN A HUGE RESPONSIBILITY IN FIGURING OUT HOW WE CAN
WHEN THAT HAPPENED PEOPLE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND SAID IF WE CAN DO THIS WE CAN DO ANYTHING
IN FACT IF ONLY THE WATER ICE AT THE POLES ON MARS MELTED MOST OF THE PLANET WOULD BE UNDER
AND THEY PROSPERED DOING THAT
AND MEANWHILE OUR TRACK RECORD OF GETTING TO MARS IS LOUSY
WE AND THE RUSSIANS THE EUROPEANS THE JAPANESE THE CHINESE AND THE INDIANS HAVE ACTUALLY SENT 44
WHY DOES IT PRESENT SO MANY DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES
WE ARE ENTERING IN A STAGE WHERE EVERYTHING WILL BE CONNECTED
I CAN ATTACH THESE TO ONE OF THESE SENSORS WITH THIS LITTLE BIT IN THE MIDDLE AND I CAN START BEAMING INFORMATION TO OTHER THINGS
WHO THINKS I'LL BE IN THE SAME JOB FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS
IT'S A REALITY
IT'S WHAT ANALYZES IT AND ALLOW IT TO DO STUFF
IT'S YOUR INSTAGRAM
ALL THESE DIFFERENT ACRONYMS THAT ARE AWESOME BUT ESSENTIALLY IT HAS GOTTEN CHEAPER IT HAS GOTTEN FASTER
YOU CAN MOVE ON TO CURING YOURSELF TO GETTING HELP
IT IS NOT COWARDICE
MY PARENTS USED TO HAVE DEPRESSION
SHE TELLS HER FRIENDS AND FAMILY
SO THAT MEANS YOU ARE CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT THAT HAS A MISSION AND A REASON BEHIND IT SO PEOPLE KNOW HOW TO REACT AND RESPOND WHEN
NAYSAWN JOINED THE HUB BECAUSE HE WAS WORKING FROM HOME ALL THE TIME
THEY MEET BECAUSE THEY HAVE A CAFFEINE FIX AND THEY WANT COFFEE BEFORE ANY OF THE HOSTS ARE THERE TO MAKE COFFEE
SO THAT MEANS THAT AS CITY DWELLERS WE ARE ONLY RUNNING INTO EACH OTHER BASICALLY HURRYING TO AND FROM OUR WORK OUR
OVER AND OVER AGAIN DAY AFTER DAY LIKE REAL RESPONSIBLE GROWN UP ADULT
PEOPLE DON'T CARE IF IS YOU OR THE NEXT PERSON THEY JUST WANT IT DONE
AND REVIEWERS WANTED ME TO COMMENT ON IDEAS THAT WERE IMPORTANT TO ME
OF PEOPLE WATCHING WHAT IS GOING ON STAGE
THEN WE HAD THE TOPIC OF THE SEAWEED THE BLADDERWRACK IN 2011
AS YOU KNOW THOSE OF YOU WHO KNOW LATVIA OGRE IS NOWHERE NEAR THE
THEN I SWITCHED TO A COMPLETELY UNRELATED FIELD
AND MY MAGNUM OPUS WAS THIS THING CALLED THE ANDES MINT MILKSHAKE
SO I WAS WALKING AROUND THE PARKING LOT I WAS CRYING I WAS SOBBING I'M NOT GOING TO LIE I'M NOT GOOD AT A LOT OF THINGS
IT WAS LIKE VEGETABLE JERKY AND KILLED ALL OF THEM
I'M JUST ABOUT TO DO FIRE
WHAT I NEEDED TO DO WAS GET FOOD OUT TO A BROADER SPECTRUM OF PEOPLE
PERHAPS MORE WORKING CLASS OR PERHAPS PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY BELIEVE IN A COOPERATIVE
THAT'S ONE VERSION
PEOPLE WERE MORE LIKELY TO SAY YES TO ME
WHY IS THAT
AND THEN DAY THREE
I WENT ACROSS AND KNOCKED ON CONNIE'S DOOR
I COULD'VE EXPLAINED I COULD'VE NEGOTIATED
IF YOU WANT TO DO THIS GO ACROSS THE STREET AND TALK TO CONNIE
I WAS ACTUALLY A MARKETING MANAGER FOR A FORTUNE 500 COMPANY
IT HAS BOTHERED ME MY WHOLE LIFE BECAUSE I WAS RUNNING AWAY FROM IT
AND HE SAID WELL OK I'LL TELL MY MANAGER ABOUT IT AND MAYBE WE'LL DO IT BUT SORRY WE CAN'T DO THIS TODAY
I CAME UP WITH A BUNCH OF PSYCHOLOGY ARTICLES ABOUT WHERE THE FEAR AND PAIN ARE COMING FROM
THEN I STARTED EMBRACING IT
I JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE IT
I DON'T WANT TO WASTE YOUR FLOWER
SO FOR THE NEXT HOUR I WAS THE STARBUCKS GREETER
AND BECAUSE I MENTIONED IS THAT WEIRD
THESE PEOPLE DID NOT LET REJECTION DEFINE THEM
SO SHE HAD ALL OF US COME TO THE FRONT OF THE CLASSROOM AND SHE BOUGHT ALL OF US GIFTS AND STACKED THEM IN THE CORNER
SO THIS IS WHERE I WENT ONLINE AND LOOKED FOR HELP
AND THEN I LEARNED I COULD FULFILL MY LIFE DREAM
BUT BEFORE HE COULD LEAVE I SAID HEY CAN I KNOW WHY
AND SHE WAS SO HAPPY TO SEE ME
I DIDN'T DO ANY OF THAT
I SAW DEAD PEOPLE
IN FACT HE INVITED ME TO EXPLAIN MYSELF
THAT MEANS I WASN'T WEIRD
IT'S AS IF HE'S PUTTING ALL THE DOUBT ON THE FLOOR
WHAT I REALLY WANTED TO DO WAS LEARN AND TO CHANGE MYSELF
THERE'RE TWO TRUTHS I WANT YOU TO NOTICE ABOUT THAT
I'LL SHOW YOU COMMON PATTERNS WHAT WE CAN LEARN FROM THEM AND HOW TO APPLY THAT TO OUR LIFE
BHUTAN FOR LIFE GIVES US THE TIME WE NEED
WE ARE ALMOST THERE
AND THEN IT OCCURRED TO ME
AS HUMANS OUR INTELLIGENCE OUR SOCIAL CAPABILITIES AND OUR PROBLEM SOLVING SKILLS ENABLE US TO WORK
WHAT'S YOUR THOUGHTS ON GETTING MY EYEBROWS TATTOOED
AND THESE ARE OUR PHOTONS THAT WE USE IN THESE COLOR EXPERIMENTS TO TELEPORT
SOME OTHER FRIENDS TOOK US IN
AND IT DIDN'T SUBSIDE UNTIL I WAS ABLE TO NAME IT I WAS ABLE TO DESCRIBE IT I WAS ABLE TO
RUNNERS ON THE OTHER HAND DIDN'T NOTICE IT
OKAY SO THAT WASN'T SO SIMPLE
SO I LIKE TO DO THIS PRAYER CALLED DHIKR WHICH INVOLVES THE REPETITION OF
SO WHAT I DID INSTEAD IS I TOOK THE AVERAGE OF THE STORIES OF MANY SENSITIVE PEOPLE AND
AS IT TURNS OUT OUR SOCIETY CAN'T MAKE UP ITS MIND
AS I WALKED I FELT LIKE THE ASYMMETRICAL TREES BENT A
IT'S TOO HARD
I'M NOT INTERESTED IN THEM
FIRST QUESTION TO ANSWER FOR US SO WHAT
THOSE ARE WAYS TO ENGAGE AND EXCITE US ABOUT YOUR CONTENT
SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT THAT THE CONTEXT THE CASUALNESS WITH WHICH WE TALK ABOUT TRILLION DOLLAR BAILOUT HERE AND TRILLION THERE
IT'S BEEN TREMENDOUSLY POWERFUL FOR CONSUMERS
7 PERCENT DECLINE
THAT INCLUDES COTTAGES AND THE LIKE BUT 30 PERCENT
ALL THESE THINGS TOGETHER BASICALLY CREATED A FACTOR WHERE THE CONSUMER DROVE US HEADLONG INTO THE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WE'VE QUESTIONED WHERE WE'RE GOING
CONTINUING EDUCATION IS UP
YOU SEE THIS RISING FORCE IN TOTAL TRANSPARENCY AND OPENNESS THAT COMPANIES ARE STARTING TO ADOPT
BUT THE ONE THING HOLDING THEM BACK IS THE ABILITY TO DISCRIMINATE
EVERYTHING IS FOCUSED ON BETTERMENT TRAINING DEVELOPMENT AND MOVING FORWARD
PEOPLE ARE GETTING THEIR HANDS DIRTY ROLLING UP THEIR SLEEVES
WELL THEY HAVE A LOT BECAUSE IT'S THEIR NETWORK OF PEOPLE
BUT AT THE SAME TIME THIS IS ALSO A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY
AND WE'RE STARTING TO BE MUCH MORE CAREFUL ABOUT HOW WE SAVE AND INVEST
LET'S TALK ABOUT DENTISTS VASECTOMIES GUNS AND SHARK ATTACKS
YOU ACTUALLY NEED TO ORGANIZE IT
WE'VE LOOKED AT OUR GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT
WE'VE QUESTIONED THE FUTURE OF CAPITALISM
WE'VE QUESTIONED THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY
WE BOUGHT EXTRA LARGE CARS SUPERSIZED EVERYTHING WE BOUGHT REMEDIES FOR RESTLESS
THEY WANT THESE SKILLS
WARNER TELL YOU WHAT JUST SEND ME A AFFIDAVIT THAT SAYS YOU OR YOUR WIFE WILL FLY TO SAN DIEGO AT YOUR OWN EXPENSE STAY IN A
SO HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO
HE SAID RIGHT CALL YOUR BANK GET THE MONEY BACK
I SAID WELL I'LL START WITH MY ALMA MATER AT UAB
I HAVE CONNECTIONS EVERYWHERE
I SAID WELL THAT WOULD COST ME MORE THAN THE 1800 I LOST
BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH CYBER CRIME
THE RUSSIANS MAY COME AFTER US
I HEARD A STORY FROM RICHARD CLARCK I WAS AT THE DARPA CYBER COLLOQUIUM IN 2011 AND HE SAID WHAT
TO REPORT A CYBER CRIME
THEY SAID WELL I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE OBJECTIVE
I'LL TAKE CARE OF DEFENDING THE GOVERNMENT FACILITIES BUT YOU GUYS MIGHT WANT TO LOOK INTO SOME ANTI AIRCRAFT AND MAYBE SOME
NO YOU SHOULD BUY INTRUSION DETECTION SOFTWARE WHAT YOU REALLY NEED IS INTRUSION PREVENTION SOFTWARE
ISN'T IT THE GOVERNMENTS JOB TO PROTECT ITS CITIZENS
WE'VE GOT STUDENTS ALL OVER THE WORLD WHO ARE FIGHTING CYBERCRIME THE WAY I DO
OKAY ONE OF HIS DEPUTIES
EVERYTHING'S MISSING OUT OF YOUR HOUSE
YOUR KIDS WANT THAT NEW XBOX 1 FOR CHRISTMAS BUT YOU WEREN'T GOING TO CAMP OUT FOR 48H AT WALLMART
I THE DA HAVE TO FLY THEM BACK TO BIRMINGHAM PUT THEM UP A SAFE PLACE WHERE THEY
WELL WE HAVE STUDENTS IN THE FBI AND IN THE CIA AND THE NSA
WHAT DIFFERENCE DID IT MAKE IN THEIR ACTIONS THEIR CHOICES TO SIMPLIFY
THIS IS WHAT THE AUTOMOTIVE COMPANY DID WHEN THEY SAW THAT MR
WHAT IS THE SOLUTION
WHEN THERE ARE TOO MANY LAYERS PEOPLE ARE TOO FAR FROM THE ACTION THEREFORE THEY NEED KPIS METRICS THEY NEED
THE REAL BATTLE IS NOT AGAINST COMPETITORS
BY REMOVING LAYERS
IT HAS A LOT OF IMPLICATIONS ON FINANCIAL POLICIES THAT WE USE
IMPROVE INTERPERSONAL FEELINGS THE MORE PEOPLE LIKE EACH OTHER THE MORE THEY WILL COOPERATE
LOOK AT HOME I HAVE TWO TVS
SO WHAT WAS THE SOLUTION USING THE HARD APPROACH
75 PERCENT OF THEM CAME FROM WITHIN 150 MILES
THIS WASN'T ROCKET SCIENCE
SOMETIMES THEIR PARENTS WOULD REJECT THEM SIBLINGS THEIR OWN CHILDREN AND THEN THEIR
IT WAS SO AWFUL BUT WHY DID THEY DO IT AT 40 AND 50
THIS STUDY POWERFULLY DEMONSTRATES THE UNSTABLE NATURE OF LANGUAGE IN SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
EVERYONE PRESUMED THEY WERE DEAD
WHAT DO THEY HAVE TO GAIN BY SHARING THIS INFORMATION
BUT REAL ACTION
SO OVER CHRISTMAS BREAK AT ABOUT 4 A
YOU THINK OF THEM AS FLAWED OR DEFECTIVE
YOU DON'T HAVE TO CONNECT
IT'S NOT HARD SCIENCE BUT I WORKED WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE I KNOW WHO'VE LIVED WITH DEPRESSION
ALSO THINGS THAT MAKE SOME PEOPLE FEEL BETTER MAY NOT WORK FOR US
YOU MAY WORRY THAT YOU WON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY AND EVERY ATTEMPT AT CONVERSATION WILL
I LIVE PRETTY WELL WITH MY BIPOLAR CONDITION AND I'VE OVERCOME SOME OTHER MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS LIKE
CAN I CALL YOU EVERY DAY
TAKE WHAT'S USEFUL
SO SOME OF THESE THINGS MAY APPLY TO YOU PERSONALLY SOME MAY NOT
MAYBE TEXT YOU EVERY DAY AND CALL LATER IN THE WEEK
WHAT WORKS FOR YOU
I HAVE TOLD PEOPLE HEY CALL OR TEXT ANY TIME BUT I MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO GET BACK TO YOU THAT SAME DAY
IT'S JUST WE ALREADY THOUGHT OF THAT
PEOPLE CAN BE SAD AND OKAY AT THE SAME TIME
YOUR DEPRESSED FRIENDS COULD BE A GOOD SOURCE OF FREE LABOR
YOU MIGHT FEAR SEEING YOUR SHADOW
WOULD YOU BE COMFORTABLE TALKING TO THEM
WHAT IF INSTEAD OF THE HOSPITAL THEY WERE AT YOUR KITCHEN TABLE AND TOLD YOU THEY WERE REALLY DEPRESSED
HERE ARE SOME POSSIBLE REASONS WHY SOME OF YOU MAY AVOID DEPRESSED PEOPLE
I'M JUST LETTING YOU SEE THAT DEPRESSED PEOPLE CAN IMAGINE ESCAPING THEIR LIVES AS CASUALLY AS SOME OF YOU
AND BEST OF ALL MY SPIRITUAL CONNECTION BECAME MUCH STRONGER
WHY IS THAT
WOULD SHE BE OVERCOME WITH JOY AND WANT TO CUDDLE THAT BUNNY
ONCE UPON A TIME SLAVERY WAS NORMAL AND IT WAS COMMONLY BELIEVED THAT THE EARTH WAS FLAT
MY DIET WAS REASONABLY GOOD BUT NOT OPTIMAL
IT'S GREAT TO HAVE SUPPORT
LADIES HOW EASY IS IT TO BREAK A NAIL
SOME PEOPLE SAY THE VEGAN LIFESTYLE DOESN'T WORK FOR THEIR BODIES
ANIMAL FOODS CLOG THE ARTERIES
IT TURNS OUT IT'S ALL ABOUT BLOOD FLOW
HAVE THEY REALLY TRIED ALL 20000 PLANT FOODS BEFORE GIVING UP
PLENTY OF PLANT FOODS ARE PERFECT JUST AS THEY ARE
OR MAKE A SAVORY BLENDED GREEN SOUP
WE'RE GROWING ENOUGH FOOD TO FEED MORE THAN TWICE THE POPULATION OF ALL THE HUMAN BEINGS IN THE WORLD
WE CERTAINLY HAVE PLENTY OF OTHER OPTIONS THESE DAYS
HE CALLS IT THE CANARY IN THE COALMINE
JUST WASH IT AND BITE INTO IT AS IT IS
MY FATHER MIGHT BE CONSIDERED WEIRD
WE'RE CUTTING DOWN OUR MAGNIFICENT RAIN FOREST AT THE RATE OF ONE ACRE PER SECOND FOR SOY BEANS TO FEED CATTLE CHICKENS
MY MOTIVATION TO GO VEG WAS NOT HEALTH
THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS I DIDN'T KNOW A SINGLE OTHER VEGETARIAN
EVEN A CUCUMBER'S EASY TO EAT ON THE RUN
I SAID THAT I WAS JUST A MOM AS A WAY TO PROTECT MYSELF AND BEAT MY FELLOW SPEAKERS TO THE PUNCH IN JUDGING
EVER SAID THAT YOU WERE JUST A SOMETHING
IS TELLING ME THAT I DON'T MATTER IT'S REALLY EASY FOR ME TO SUMMON THE COURAGE TO VERBALLY FIGHT BACK
WE SEE EACH OTHER FOR WHO WE ARE ON THE INSIDE
BUT I D NEVER REALLY HAD TO APPLY ALL OF THESE ASPECTS OF MY PHILOSOPHY TO THE TEST AT ONE TIME
IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT WE REIMAGINED SOME TRADITIONS BUT WE ALSO KEPT SOME OLD ONES THAT WE WORKED IN
WHAT IT MEANS TO BE HARD ON THE ISSUES BUT SOFT ON THE PERSON
ABOUT CREATING A MANHOOD THAT ISN'T MEASURED BY THE POWER IT WIELDS BY THE ENTITLEMENTS AFFORDED TO IT
HAD BEING TRANSGENDER SOMEHOW PRECLUDED ME FROM LOVE AND MONOGAMY
BUT TODAY I'M A MAN OF MY OWN INTENTION A MAN OF MY OWN DESIGN
I'VE STRIPPED AWAY EMOTIONAL SUPPORT INSTEAD OF FACING MY OWN VULNERABILITIES PARTICULARLY AROUND THE HEARTBREAKING
AND I SAW THAT I WASN'T ALWAYS THE BEST LISTENER AND THAT MY EGO GOT IN THE WAY OF OUR PROGRESS AS A COUPLE
ONES THAT ARE ABOUT CREATING THE SPACE FOR US TO BE OUR AUTHENTIC SELVES AND NOT IMPOSING THIS
SOMETIMES AS MEN WE GET TO TAKE THE EASY WAY OUT
WE CONSTANTLY EXPERIENCE THIS RETELLING OF HISTORY WHERE WE ARE CONSPICUOUSLY LEFT OUT
WE WERE ABLE TO COME BACK TOGETHER TO EACH OTHER AND RECOMMIT TO OURSELVES TO EACH OTHER AND TO
SO MANY OF US HAVE NOT RECEIVED LOVE FROM OUR FAMILIES HAVE BEEN BETRAYED BY THE PEOPLE THAT WE
WE'VE LEARNED HOW TO LOVE EACH OTHER FOR THE LONG HAUL
SHE SAID THAT THESE WERE REMINDERS OF MY STRENGTH AND EVERYTHING THAT I WENT THROUGH AND NOTHING FOR ME TO BE ASHAMED OF
SO OFTEN WHAT WE'RE TOLD IS THIS IDEA OF THE GOLDEN RULE THAT WE SHOULD TREAT OTHER PEOPLE THE WAY
IT'S REASONED JUSTIFIED AND OFTEN SIGNED INTO LAW
SHE HAS BEEN MY HERO SINCE DAY ONE
QUEER LIKE A FREEDOM TOO STRANGE TO BE CONQUERED
YOU'RE BEGINNING TO SEE THE EMERGENCE OF A MULTI POLAR WORLD
BUT A MULTIPLE POLARITY OF POWER MEANS SHIFTING AND CHANGING ALLIANCES
THEY WILL REMAIN THE MOST POWERFUL NATION BUT THEY WILL BE THE MOST POWERFUL NATION IN AN INCREASINGLY MULTI POLAR WORLD
OF COURSE THEY ARE THEY ARE A MERCANTILIST NATION
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IN INDUSTRY GOVERNMENTS DON'T
THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN POETRY THE POEM IS A SHROPSHIRE LAD WRITTEN BY A
THE POEM IS CALLED NO MAN IS AN ISLAND
UP UNTIL NOW THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN THE DOMINANT FEATURE OF OUR WORLD
WE HAD TO BRING IN THIS CASE THE ARAB LEAGUE IN
IF PARIS GOT TOGETHER WITH BERLIN BRITAIN GOT TOGETHER WITH VIENNA AND ROME TO PROVIDE A COUNTERBALANCE
BRITAIN ALWAYS PLAYED TO THE BALANCE
COMMAND IN THE WORLD TODAY
THEY WANT TO KEEP THE SEA LANES OPEN
YOU IN BUSINESS KNOW THAT THE PARADIGM STRUCTURE OF OUR TIME LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IS THE NETWORK
NOTE THAT WHEN WE WENT INTO LIBYA IT WAS NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE WEST TO DO IT ALONE WE HAD TO
THERE WAS A BALANCE A FIVE SIDED BALANCE
WELL IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE'RE NOW SEEING A FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT OF POWER BROADLY SPEAKING AWAY FROM NATIONS GATHERED AROUND THE
WE ARE NOW INTERDEPENDENT
AND IF YOU LOOK YOU CAN SEE THEM HAPPENING ALREADY BEGINNING TO EMERGE
FOR POWER IS NOT JUST MOVING LATERALLY FROM NATION TO NATION
IT'S ALSO MOVING VERTICALLY
WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY IS THAT THE POWER THAT WAS ENCASED HELD TO ACCOUNTABILITY HELD TO THE RULE OF LAW
INCREASINGLY WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DO BUSINESS WITH PEOPLE WITH WHOM WE DO NOT SHARE VALUES
AND I HATCHED THE IDEA THAT THERE ARE REALLY TWO KINDS OF IDENTITY
BUT SPEAKING FOR MYSELF WELL I WOULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED 23 YEARS AGO WHEN HE WAS BORN THAT I COULD
AND I WANTED ALSO TO PROTECT MYSELF FROM ILLNESS
AND I DON'T ACCEPT SUBTRACTIVE MODELS OF LOVE ONLY ADDITIVE ONES
AND HE ENDED UP ACHIEVING AT A LEVEL THAT HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN CONTEMPLATED BY ANY MEMBER OF HIS FAMILY
BUT I THINK IT'S A TRAGEDY WHEN ONE OF THEM DOESN'T SEE THE OTHER
IF I HADN'T GONE TO OHIO STATE AND CROSSED PATHS WITH TOM THIS CHILD WOULDN'T HAVE EXISTED AND THIS TERRIBLE THING
AND I SUDDENLY THOUGHT MOST DEAF CHILDREN ARE BORN TO HEARING PARENTS
WE WERE SITTING IN THE KITCHEN
AND EVEN THOUGH SHE DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF EDUCATIONAL OR FINANCIAL ADVANTAGES SHE FOUND THE BEST DOCTOR IN THE COUNTRY FOR
TESTING IN HUMANS IS AROUND THE CORNER
AND KAREN ROBARDS SAID TO ME I'M WITH TOM
DO YOU WISH YOUR CHILD DIDN'T HAVE DOWN SYNDROME
AND I BELIEVE IN BOTH OF THEM
SHE SAID I KNEW I COULDN'T GO IN THERE AND INTERRUPT HIM BUT I WENT HOME AND I LEFT HIM EIGHT MESSAGES ON HIS CELL PHONE
AND ULTIMATELY I FEEL THAT IN THE SAME WAY THAT WE TEST FLAME RETARDANT PAJAMAS IN AN INFERNO
AND THE FIRST WEEKEND I SPENT WITH THEM THE FIRST OF MANY I RECORDED MORE THAN 20 HOURS OF CONVERSATION
IN SO FAR AS HE WAS EXTENDING THEM HE WAS DOING SO ASYMMETRICALLY WHICH SHE THOUGHT COULD MEAN THAT THERE WAS A TUMOR OF SOME
AND HE HAD A VERY LARGE HEAD WHICH SHE THOUGHT MIGHT INDICATE HYDROCEPHALUS
TWO BEERS FOR THEM IS FOUR BEERS FOR HIM
ONE OF THE FAMILIES I INTERVIEWED TOM AND KAREN ROBARDS WERE TAKEN ABACK WHEN AS YOUNG AND
IN THE TIME SINCE THAT ATLANTIC MONTHLY STORY RAN THE LIFE EXPECTANCY FOR PEOPLE WITH DOWN SYNDROME
AND YET I KNEW FROM THE WORK I HAD DONE THAT IF HE HAD ANY OF THE THINGS WE WERE ABOUT TO START TESTING
THIS IS WHAT WE HEAR WHEN YOU PRAY FOR A CURE THAT YOUR FONDEST WISH FOR US IS THAT SOMEDAY WE
AND MANY PEOPLE WERE ASTONISHED AND SAID BUT HOW CAN YOU DECIDE TO HAVE CHILDREN IN THE MIDST OF
THOSE HEARING PARENTS TEND TO TRY TO CURE THEM
I SAID I'M GAY
AND I WAS RATHER TAKEN ABACK
AND LIKE ALL PARENTS SINCE THE DAWN OF TIME I WANTED TO PROTECT MY CHILD FROM ILLNESS
I HAD THOUGHT OF DEAFNESS ENTIRELY AS AN ILLNESS
SHE SAID THAT MIGHT MEAN THAT HE HAD BRAIN DAMAGE
THIS IS WHAT WE HEAR WHEN YOU MOURN OVER OUR EXISTENCE
THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO SENSE AND COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR NEIGHBORS
BUT I'D NEVER DONE ANYTHING ABOUT MYSELF
I'D NEVER REALLY MEMORIALIZED MYSELF
WE EVEN HAD TO ADD SOMEONE TO OUR SCHEDULES WHO WAS THE PERSON YOU CALLED WHEN YOU THOUGHT YOU'D ARRIVED BUT THEN REALIZED YOU HADN'T
WE AGREED THAT ADDRESSES WERE BAD
WE THOUGHT IT WAS ESSENTIAL THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE THIS SYSTEM IN THEIR OWN LANGUAGE
AND SO YOU'RE THINKING YEAH
YOU MIGHT CHANGE YOUR MIND IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT BUT AT LEAST YOU'RE PRACTICED WITH THIS KIND OF THINKING
AND THEY INCLUDE TERRIBLE THINGS DEBILITATING MUSCLE AND JOINT PAIN GASTROINTESTINAL DISTRESS
REMEMBER WHEN YOU'RE UNDER STRESS THE BRAIN RELEASES CORTISOL
MY DOCTOR WOULDN'T PRESCRIBE SOMETHING TO ME IF IT'S NOT GOING TO HELP
THESE ARE THINGS TO TALK ABOUT AND THINK ABOUT NOW WITH YOUR FAMILY AND YOUR LOVED ONES
AND IF YOU'RE LUCKY AND YOU'RE ONE OF THE 50 PERCENT WHO HAS THESE THEY'LL ONLY LAST FOR A YEAR OR TWO
300 PEOPLE HAVE TO TAKE THE DRUG FOR A YEAR BEFORE ONE HEART ATTACK STROKE OR OTHER ADVERSE EVENT IS PREVENTED
BUT WAIT A MINUTE
THEY INCLUDE IMPOTENCE ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION URINARY INCONTINENCE RECTAL TEARING
AND THERE'S PERHAPS NO MORE STRESSFUL A SITUATION THAN WHEN YOU'RE CONFRONTED WITH A MEDICAL DECISION TO MAKE
SO IN THE HOME DESIGNATE A SPOT FOR YOUR KEYS A HOOK BY THE DOOR MAYBE A DECORATIVE BOWL
FOR YOUR PASSPORT A PARTICULAR DRAWER
FOR YOUR READING GLASSES A PARTICULAR TABLE
ANOTHER WAY TO OUT THIS
GIVEN OUR DISCONNECTION FROM NATURE I THINK THAT THIS MIGHT BE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE UNDERESTIMATING THAT COULD
WHAT THEY FIND IS THAT ON THE WAY INTO THE PARK PEOPLE STOP TO PICK UP THAT GLOVE ABOUT 62 PERCENT
FOR US TO TACKLE THESE PROBLEMS WE NEED BROAD BUY IN WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER WE NEED TO WORK COLLECTIVELY AND
WHEN THEY ACTUALLY WENT ON THE WALK THEY FELT A LOT BETTER IF THEY WERE IN NATURE COMPARED TO INDOORS
BUT IF WE COLLECTIVELY CATCH TOO MANY FISH THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO SPAWN THERE'LL BE NO FISH AVAILABLE TO CATCH
IT WAS ACTUALLY ASA CARTER WHO WROTE THOSE INFAMOUS WORDS THAT WALLACE SAID ON THE STEPS OF THE ALABAMA
NOW I FIRST LEARNED ABOUT THIS STORY THE WAY I LEARNED ABOUT LOTS OF GOOD STORIES I KNOW FROM THE RADIO SHOW THIS AMERICAN
WE SEE THE SAME RESULT IN POLICE DATA
I LOVE THIS HAT
A HAT FOR EVERY OCCASION
YOU MAY KNOW IT FROM THE CAT AND THE HAT
A SPEAKER'S ART IS THE EFFECTIVE DELIVERY OF THE SPOKEN WORD
AND BY THE WAY I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE KIND OF PERFORMANCE WHERE YOU GO ALL OUT ON STAGE IN FRONT OF THE AUDIENCE AND ACT
I CALL IT PUTTING ON A NEW HAT
WHO OUT THERE SHOULD BE CHANGING THE WORLD
AND NOW EVENTUALLY I CAN SAY THAT ONE OF MY ACHIEVEMENTS WILL BE THAT I CAN GET MARRIED TO SOMEONE
I KNOW RUBEN PERSONALLY FROM MY WORK AND TO COME UP HERE AND OFFER UNDERSTANDING AND AWARENESS
WHERE IS IT GOING NEXT
AND ON ONE OF THEM I WANTED TO PUT ABOUT THE DISCUSSIONS FOR SAME SEX MARRIAGE AND I DIDN'T ACTUALLY THINK IT
WHEN IS THIS RECESSION GOING TO END
WAS I ABLE TO LIVE AS A COWARD LIKE EVERYONE ELSE OR WAS I GOING TO MAKE A STAND
WHAT THAT MEANT THAT IF YOU STAYED OUT OF TROUBLE YOU'RE GOING TO STAY ALIVE
TEN MONTHS LATER I QUIT MY JOB
I'VE HAD AMERICANS TELL ME THAT THEY'VE DONATED DIRECT DEDUCTIONS FROM THEIR BANK ACCOUNT MONEY TO GO TO SYRIAN CHILDREN
NAMED GEORGE ZIMMERMAN WHO ENDED UP SHOOTING AND KILLING HIM
WE'RE CREATING MOBILE PIECES LIKE THE TRAYVON MARTIN PIECE
UNTIL ONE DAY SHE CAME BACK TO MY OFFICE AND SHE WAS BAWLING SHE WAS JUST CRYING
AND I HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE COME OUT OF THAT PIECE SAYING OH MY GOD I WAS SO FRUSTRATED
I HAVE TO REALLY FOLLOW BEST JOURNALISTIC PRACTICES AND MAKE SURE THAT THESE POWERFUL
AND IF WE COULD MATCH THAT WITH HIS SPEECH AND WHAT HE WAS TELLING US WHEN HE WAS SPEAKING HOW MUCH BETTER WOULD WE
IT MEANT THAT I DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IF YOU DON'T WANT ME TO KNOW SOMETHING THAT IS SECRETIVE AND
I WANT US ALL TO BE AGENTS OF CHANGE
I SAID XAVI WHAT DO YOU MEAN
NOW HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE EVER WANTED TO ASK A QUESTION BUT HELD BACK
THAT'S THE NEXT QUESTION
MY NAME IS JESSICA AND TODAY I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT MY CRAZY EXPERIMENTS INTO
IT'S CALLED THE WAVE BUBBLE
WE'RE ALMOST BLINDLY RELIANT ON IT
OKAY WHAT ABOUT THE FBI
AND WHY IS THAT
I SHOULD HAVE ONE
THE SUPREME COURT RULED LAST MONTH THAT A POLICEMAN HAS TO GET A WARRANT IF HE WANTS TO DO PROLONGED
BUT WE NOW STAND ON THE VERGE OF ANOTHER REVOLUTION IN GEOLOCATION ACCURACY
ON THAT MORNING U
I WAS IN MY OFFICE SOME MONTHS BACK AND GOT A TELEPHONE CALL
THEY ARE BECOMING PART OF ITS SPHERE OF INFLUENCE
OF COURSE WE CAN'T FORGET AFRICA
BUT WHAT ARE THEY GUARDING
THEY THINK MORE IN TERMS OF EMPIRES AND HIERARCHIES USUALLY CHINESE OR JAPANESE
JUST TAKE THE BALKANS
THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE CHANGE THOSE BORDERS AND WHAT LINES DO WE FOCUS ON
NOW LET'S LOOK AT THE ONLY PART OF THE WORLD THAT REALLY HAS BROUGHT DOWN ITS BORDERS AND HOW THAT HAS ENHANCED ITS STRENGTH
WELL IF YOU REMEMBER BEFORE WORLD WAR II JAPAN HAD A VISION FOR A GREATER JAPANESE CO PROSPERITY SPHERE
SO WHAT'S NEXT
WHO WILL WIN
SINGAPORE FOR EXAMPLE USED TO BAN CHINESE LANGUAGE EDUCATION
NOW IT ENCOURAGES IT
AND NOW MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN READING IN THE NEWS HOW PEOPLE ARE LOOKING TO CHINA TO LEAD THE REBOUND THE
IT'S BUYING IT
TODAY COUNTRIES ARE BOUGHT
IT'S JUST LEASING IT
LIFE SKILLS SUCH AS COMMUNICATION RESPONSIBILITY CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS PROBLEM SOLVING
I HAVE A SON
AN IMAGE OF THE 1
WE HAVE SONS IN HERE
WHAT WAS YOUR MOST MEMORABLE EXPERIENCE YOU AND YOUR DAUGHTER SHARED IN THIS PROGRAM
7 MILLION MINOR CHILDREN WHO HAVE AN INCARCERATED PARENT
WE MUST REMEMBER THAT NO ONE IS MANDATED TO GIVE OUR CHILDREN ANY TYPE OF AN
MY INNER CHILD WHO HUNGERED FOR THE EMBRACE OF MY PARENTS LOST TO THE SYSTEM HAD BEGUN TO
BECAUSE AS A YOUNG BOY I WAS TAUGHT THAT BOYS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE STRONG AND BRAVE
IF WOMEN ARE EQUAL NOW THEN TO TALK ABOUT SEXISM TO COMPLAIN ABOUT SEXISM MUST BE OVERREACTING
WHY WAS THIS SO NORMAL
WOMEN ARE EQUAL NOW MORE OR LESS
IT FLOODED IN A WAY THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT THAN IT NORMALLY DOES
IS THIS THE KIND OF SIMPLE THAT LOOKS OBVIOUS OR THE KIND THAT LOOKS PROFOUND
THIS ONE GENERATES NO IMAGERY AT ALL
DON'T BE TRENDY IF YOU WANT TO BE SERIOUS
MAYBE WHAT WANTS TO BE SAID IS THAT OLD AND THE NEW ARE LOCKED IN A DIALECTICAL EMBRACE A KIND OF DANCE WHERE EACH DEFINES THE
HOWEVER INSTEAD OF IMMEDIATELY GIVING IT TO HER I DEBATED IT FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES THINKING THE MOST
TODAY I ENCOURAGE EACH EVERY ONE OF YOU
AS THE HUMAN RACE DEVELOPS AT ASTONISHING RATE MY GENERATION SUFFERS
WHAT IF WITH THIS LACK OF COMPASSION AND RANDOM ACTS OF KINDNESS COMES THE LACK OF CONCERN AND NEED TO
DURING MY SOPHOMORE YEAR MY FRIENDS AND I WERE CATCHING THE BUS DOWN TO KIHEI TO GO TO THE BEACH
I WAS NOT FAZED BY OTHERS' LACK OF COMPASSION
AND QUITE HONESTLY I ALMOST EXPECT NO ONE TO HELP HER
AND IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE DIFFICULT IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE SHOWN MONUMENTAL ACTS OF
DOES PARLIAMENT CHARGE LESS TAX THAN KINGS
STATISTICS LOOKS BACK PROBABILITY LOOKS FORWARD
WHAT AGE DID PEOPLE DIE AT
I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT THAT'S ABSOLUTE RUBBISH
AND THEIR RESPONSE TO THIS IS TO SAY OH BUT THERE'S LOTS OF OTHER INITIATIVES THAT ARE COMING IN AND THAT'S GOING TO MOP
WELL YOU KNOW SOMETHING LIKE THE CAYMAN ISLANDS IS A SOVEREIGN STATE IT'S ENTITLED TO SET ITS TAX RATES
NOW I'M NOT SUGGESTING FOR A SECOND THAT WE SHOULD GET RID OF STOCK MARKETS COMPLETELY I DON'T THINK THAT AT ALL
THEY HAD A RECESSION SO MORE PEOPLE FELL INTO UNEMPLOYMENT AND NEEDED UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS
NOW WHAT THAT MULTINATIONAL CORPORATION CAN DO IS IT CAN SET UP A SUBSIDIARY COMPANY
AND THIS ISN'T SOMETHING THAT I'M JUST MAKING UP
THERE WAS JUST THIS BLIND FAITH THIS AUTOMATIC ASSUMPTION THAT THIS ABSOLUTELY MUST BE A GREAT WAY
AND OBVIOUSLY THIS IS AN EVENT THAT'S BEEN ORGANIZED BY THE LONDON BUSINESS SCHOOL SO I IMAGINE LOTS OF PEOPLE IN
WHERE HAVE WE GONE WRONG
SO I DON'T SUBSCRIBE TO THE VIEW THAT'S PUT FORWARD IN A LOT OF NEWSPAPERS THAT JUST BECAUSE SOMEBODY
NOW FOR A COUNTRY LIKE GREECE THERE'S A KERNEL OF TRUTH IN THAT BUT FOR THE OTHER COUNTRIES NO
AND I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT RBS AND LLOYDS THAT HAD DIRECT MONEY INJECTED INTO THEM BY THE
SO I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF THE SORT OF THING MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES DO
WELL NO IT'S NOT
SO THE FACT THAT THEY CAN GO OUT AND BORROW IN THE MARKETS AT LOWER RATES OF INTEREST THAN THEY COULD DO IF THE MARKET
THE BANK OF ENGLAND HAVE DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH INTO THIS AND THINK THIS IS WORTH BILLIONS OF POUNDS PER YEAR TO BANKS LIKE
NOW I WOULD 100 AGREE WITH BOTH OF THOSE THINGS
SO I NOW WORK ON FINANCIAL REFORM IN A THINK TANK BUT I USED TO WORK ON THE TRADING FLOOR OF
AND IT'S THAT SORT OF MENTALITY THAT WE REALLY HAVE TO MOVE AWAY FROM BECAUSE A BELIEF IN THE
AND AT THE MOMENT I THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD AGREE THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE SEVERELY OVERPAID IN
BECAUSE WE'RE TURNING AROUND TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AFFORD AN ARMY OF ACCOUNTANTS AND LAWYERS
THERE ISN'T THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE TO BACK UP THIS CLAIM
NOW I DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME SO I DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO THROUGH ALL THOSE DIFFERENT INITIATIVES THAT ARE COMING
SIMILARLY THE RECESSION CAUSED A COLLAPSE IN TAX REVENUES
BE UNDER NO MISTAKE THE EUROZONE CRISIS AND THE 2008
AND SIMILARLY IF A BUSINESS WANTS TO LOCATE IN THE CAYMAN ISLANDS IT SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO DO THAT
AND WE NEED TO START RECOGNIZING ITS LIMITATIONS AND NOT JUST RELIGIOUSLY APPLYING
AND THE PROBLEM WITH THAT SYSTEM IS THAT THAT MEANS THAT ALL THESE BUSINESSES AND THOSE MANAGERS ARE
I MEAN THEY'RE BOTH EXTREME LIKE I SAY ALMOST RELIGIOUS VALUES TO HOLD AND CLEARLY YOU KNOW SOME ARE
A WAY TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY
I THINK THERE ARE TONS OF THINGS THAT BUSINESS AND THE MARKET DOES REALLY REALLY WELL
NOW A LOT OF YOU ARE PROBABLY THINKING
SO THE QUESTION IS MORE
I THINK ONCE AGAIN THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS THAT STOCK MARKETS ARE GOOD AT
AND IF WE'RE GOING TO START GETTING PEOPLE TO BELIEVE IN CAPITALISM AGAIN
FROM FRANCE TO HAITI FROM THE STREETS TO OUR HOMES REVOLUTIONARY FREEDOM FIGHTERS HAVE BEEN
AS STORYTELLERS WE KNOW WHAT WE IMAGINE WE'RE LIKELY TO CREATE
WE ARE NOT MEANT TO SAVE THE EARTH WE ARE MEANT TO LEAVE IT BEHIND
A DREAM THAT I HAD NOT LET MYSELF TAKE SERIOUSLY FOR A LONG TIME BEGAN TO TUG AT ME
ALL POWER COMES FROM THE UNIVERSE THAT SURROUNDS THEM
AND THAT'S AN IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE
IN IT WE SEE SUPERMAN RUSHING OUT GRABBING A CAR THAT'S FULL OF
WE START WORK ON THE FIRST DAY
AND THAT TO ME IS THE KEY
BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN NOW THERE WAS A SECOND PROBLEM
BECAUSE THAT FLUSHES THE BUG OUT
AND HE CAME OUT AND WITHIN A DAY IT WORKED OUT THAT MOST DUST IN THIS COMMUNITY WAS WITHIN A METER OF THE GROUND THE WIND
IS THIS ELIMINATING POVERTY
I PUT IT TO YOU
WELL OVER 1000 PEOPLE USE THOSE TOILETS
THAT'S OUR AVERAGE BUDGET
SO TWO PROBLEMS AND DESIGN SHOULD BE ABOUT MORE THAN ONE THING
SO WHAT DO WE DO
YOU CAN'T BREATHE AS WELL
AND FOR A WHOLE HOUSE THE NINE HEALTHY LIVING PRACTICES WE TEST CHECK AND FIX 250 ITEMS IN EVERY
WHY DO WE HAVE TO DO THIS WORK
THEY HAD KILLED MANY MEN RAPED MANY WOMEN
THE RESULTING INATTENTION TO LOCAL CONFLICTS LEADS TO INADEQUATE PEACEBUILDING IN THE SHORT
THIS IS BECAUSE YOUR MIND CATEGORIZES EVERYTHING WITH LANGUAGE LABELS SO THAT IT CAN REACH FOR YOUR MEMORIES AS
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK EVERYONE
AND EVERYTHING THAT YOU SAY AND DO EVERY DECISION YOU MAKE EVERY CONVERSATION THAT YOU HAVE IS JUST A
SO ONE SUCH PROGRAM EXISTS IN JAFFA CALLED THE ORCHARD OF ABRAHAM'S CHILDREN
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF LINGUISTIC RELATIVITY
SO WHEN MY GERMAN FRIEND TAUGHT ME THIS WORD I THOUGHT
AND DID YOU KNOW THAT THE LANGUAGES THAT YOUR CHILD IS EXPOSED TO BEFORE THE AGE OF 7 WHICH IS ALSO
I THINK THEY LET ME IN BY ACCIDENT
SO WE WERE WORKING WITH A MANUFACTURER PROBABLY THE ONE YOU HAD IN YOUR HOME BECAUSE THEY KNEW PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO
I GOT TO WORK ON THE FIRST CONSUMER FACING DIGITAL CAMERA AND NOW WE CAN CAPTURE ALL THE SMILES
WE CALL THIS FUNNEL VISION AND IT GETS YOU TO THAT SET THAT YOU CAN START WORKING FROM
DON'T CROSS THE LINE
THAT WOULD COST TOO MUCH MONEY
THE ENGINEERING TAUGHT ME HOW TO BUILD PRODUCTS AND HOW HARD IT IS TO BUILD PRODUCTS
WILL IT IMPROVE THE WORLD
THE REST WAS UP TO HIM
WE'LL FORCE THEM TO DO IT
WILL IT CHANGE THE WAY PEOPLE INTERACT
I'M TALKING ABOUT GETTING FROM CAN'T TO CAN TO COME UP WITH THE IDEAS IN THE FIRST PLACE SO YOU DON'T FEEL
PEOPLE WOULD NEVER USE THAT
BUT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH ALL THESE IDEAS
WHAT IF WE COULD FIND A SOLUTION BETWEEN FUNDING AND DEFUNDING AN ORGANIZATION THAT HELPS WOMEN'S HEALTH
BUILD IT ANYWAY
AND YOU'LL DO IT
THERE WERE SO MANY RULES AROUND WHAT WE HAD TO DO THAT THE CULTURE CONSTRAINED ME LIKE A CORSET
I SAID DADA READ THIS
STAND IN LINE
SOME OF YOU UNDERSTAND THE TECHNIQUE I CAN ASK WHAT IF
NO HUMAN CAN EVER DO THAT
I TRIED TO ANALYZE THAT KIND OF KNOWLEDGE
AND MAYBE THAT WILL LEAD US TO THAT SUSTAINABLE FUTURE THAT WE ALL DREAM ABOUT
THE THREAD THAT TIES ALL OF THESE FORMS OF COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE TOGETHER WERE THE SAME THINGS THAT
BUT WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT PLACEBO DOESN'T SEEM TO JUST APPLY TO COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE
SO AS I DUG DEEPER WHAT I REALIZED IS THAT WHAT IS BEING CALLED COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE HERE IN THE
PLACEBO'S ACTUALLY MADE UP OF A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS
IT ALSO APPLIES TO MODERN MEDICINE AS WELL
IS IT THE BIOCHEMICAL MOLECULAR MODEL CAMP OR IS IT THE COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE CAMP
THESE ARE MEDICINES LIKE TIBETAN MEDICINE AYURVEDIC MEDICINE AND CHINESE
SO AS A CHILD I READ VORACIOUSLY I LOVED TO READ
AND AS I CONTINUED MY STUDIES WHAT I REALIZED IS THAT THOSE CAMPS OF THOUGHT WERE VERY MUCH
ONCE WE GET RID OF THE DISEASE WE'RE HEALED
AND THIS IS THE BIGGEST OXYMORON WE HAVE IN THE SOCIETY
I KNEW THEY WERE COMING FOR ME BECAUSE I WAS THE ONLY PERSON FOR MILES AROUND
I TRIED TO REPLICATE WHAT WE HAD DONE IN PAIHIA IN OTHER TOWNS BUT
SO I CREATED THE SEVEN DAY MAKEOVER
FOR A FEW YEARS I ALSO USED TO ATTEND AUTOMOTIVE TRADE SHOWS TAKING PLACE IN HUGE
COUNTERFEITING IS SET TO BECOME A 2
YOU CAN MAKE 2000 PERCENT SELLING FAKES ONLINE WITH LITTLE OF THE SAME RISKS OR PENALTIES
AND THEY WOULD SELL ME FAKE CAR PARTS FAULTY FAKE CAR PARTS THAT HAVE BEEN ESTIMATED TO CAUSE OVER
DID I HAVE A BUSINESS CARD
WHERE WERE THE POLO SHIRTS COMING FROM
AND THIS QUICK EASY MONEY THEN GOES ON TO FUND THE MORE SERIOUS TYPES OF CRIME AND IT PAYS THE WAY TO MAKING THESE
WHAT PAPERWORK DID HE HAVE
AND WHEN WAS HIS NEXT SHIPMENT GOING TO ARRIVE
RELIEF ONLY COMES WHEN YOU TURN THE FIRST CORNER AND GLANCE BEHIND AND THEY'RE NOT STANDING THERE
BUT YOU CAN'T BE JUST CREATIVE
BUT I'VE NEVER QUITE GOTTEN A PROBLEM LIKE FOLD WHATEVER YOU WANT
AND MY ART SKILLS WERE CRAPPY
AND IF YOU ARE SURE OF WHERE YOU'RE GOING I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER THE SECOND STORY OF HAVING ENOUGH
I DON'T REMEMBER MEETING YOU
OH THAT GUY
I THINK THE GREATEST ADVERSITY THAT WE'VE CREATED FOR OURSELVES IS THIS IDEA OF NORMALCY
HE SAID WELL YOU WOULDN'T REMEMBER MEETING ME
IT'S CALLED THE STREAMING TRIALS
AND OF COURSE THE HEARTBREAKING FLIP SIDE OF THIS STUDY IS THAT THEY TOOK THE A STUDENTS
LET ME READ YOU THE ENTRY
P'S PART TO GET ME TO DO THE EXERCISES I DIDN'T WANT TO DO BEFORE THE PROSPECT OF BEING THE RICHEST FIVE YEAR OLD IN THE
IN OUR DESIRE TO PROTECT THOSE WE CARE ABOUT BY GIVING THEM THE COLD HARD TRUTH ABOUT THEIR MEDICAL
AND TELLS EACH OTHER THEY'RE GREAT
BEING FAT TO ME NOW IT'S JUST A WORD IT'S JUST ONE OF THE MANY DESCRIPTORS
HAVING SAID THAT HOW DO YOU HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP OR EVEN JUST A BETTER RELATIONSHIP IF YOU
MY TRANSITION STARTS IN 2008 WHEN I STARTED BLOGGING ABOUT PLUS
SO DON'T SEARCH FOR ONE DON'T WAIT FOR ONE JUST ACCEPT THE ONE YOU WERE OFFERED OR MAKE UP ONE YOURSELF AND
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME
WE DE AVERAGED THEM AND BROKE THEM DOWN INTO DIFFERENT SKILL LEVELS AND WHAT WE FOUND
NOW THE SHORT ANSWER WOULD BE THAT OUR NUMBERS ALREADY INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN
AND COMPANIES WILL LOOK FOR TALENTS SOMEWHERE ELSE
AS A MATTER OF FACT 1964 WAS THE YEAR WITH THE HIGHEST BIRTH RATE EVER IN
IF THEY ARE THE SCARCE RESOURCE WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THEM MUCH BETTER
SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN
SEND ME MORE OF THESE MACHINES
LAST YEAR WE JUST HIT OVER 600000 SO HALF OF MY NUMBER
THE HOSPITAL'S MATERNITY WARD WAS REALLY STRESSED OUT BECAUSE A LOT OF BABIES WERE
IT WAS A GRAY NOVEMBER DAY AND I WAS OVERDUE
WE WON'T GROW ANYMORE
SOMETHING VISCERAL IS TRANSFERRED TO US BY WATCHING OTHERS IN MOTION AS IF WE WERE THE ONES MOVING
AND I THOUGHT OH MY GOD I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT I HAD REPLIED TO THAT ONE
AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW
AND I AM GOING TO TRY RIGHT NOW
WELL WE CAN SIMPLY BET ON IT
IF THEY LOOK LIKE THEY ARE ARGUING YOU HAVE A SENSE I KNOW THERE'S AN ARGUMENT GOING ON
YOU KNOW THEY'RE BUILT OVER TIME
THAT WAS CONNECTIVITY FOR HIM
I HAVE FOUR BROTHERS TO WHOM I AM VERY CLOSE AND WE ALL CARRY CELLPHONES
VERY DIFFICULT SCHOOL SOME EXPERIENCE
USUALLY IT'S BUILT THROUGH SOMETHING YOU GO THROUGH
THEY DON'T SUDDENLY HAPPEN
YOU DON'T SEND SOMEBODY AN EMAIL AND HAVE THAT KIND OF CONNECTION
COMMANDERS WOULD SOMETIMES FLY OVER A UNIT ON THE GROUND AND THEY'D TALK BY RADIO TO THEM AND THEY'D WATCH
SO THE QUESTION TO ASK YOURSELF
DO YOU HAVE REAL CONNECTIONS
AT FIVE YEARS OLD THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT WITH THE NUMBER FIVE
I ALSO ASKED YOU
WE'RE USED TO TALKING ABOUT STARS
AND WHAT HAPPENED WAS EXACTLY WHAT YOU'D EXPECT THAT SOME GROUPS WERE VERY MUCH MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN OTHERS
THE SWEDES EVEN HAVE A SPECIAL TERM FOR THIS
WHEN ALEX PENTLAND SUGGESTED TO ONE COMPANY THAT THEY SYNCHRONIZE COFFEE BREAKS SO THAT PEOPLE WOULD HAVE
THEY ARE TAKING IT ON
SO NOW IS THE TIME TO WORK TOWARDS THIS PARADIGM SHIFT THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT AND
IT CAN'T JUST STAY WITH THE KIDS
WE'RE STARTING TO CREATE A FARM TO SCHOOL NETWORK IN THE STATE AND REALLY HELPING THESE PROJECTS THAT WERE
FARMER'S MARKETS ARE POPPING UP IN OUR COMMUNITY AND I'VE ONLY BEEN THERE FOR A YEAR AND A HALF DOING THIS TYPE OF
GOOD FOOD FOR OXFORD SCHOOLS WORKS IN THREE DIFFERENT AREAS
CONSIDERING I FEEL LIKE I'M A PRETTY FUN PERSON
WHEN CAN WE EAT THAT
THIS IS A KIND OF A BLOWING STRAW
WE WORK TOGETHER BOTH ON A MODEST PROPOSAL DANCE TO PHD TODAY
SOMETHING IS NOT QUITE RIGHT
DON'T ADD BACK THE OIL FAT AND SUGAR IT'S A LOT CHEAPER IT REALLY WORKS
NOBODY TAUGHT YOU HOW TO PICK THE BEST PERSON FOR THE JOB
NOW IMAGINE THIS KIND OF RED T SHIRT CRISTIANO RONALDO THE BEST FOOTBALL PLAYER IN THE WORLD IMAGINE
IT'S NOT TAKING YOUR TEAM TO THE OPERA
BECAUSE PERFORMANCE IS HIGHLY VISIBLE
BECAUSE I ENTERED THE MOST CREATIVE PERIOD OF MY LIFE
NOW FOR THE AMERICAN FRIENDS WHEN I SEE FOOTBALL WHAT I MEAN IS SOCCER
BECAUSE ANYBODY CAN SEE HOW GOOD THIS GUY IS
WE ACT AS IF EVERYBODY DELIVERS THE SAME PERFORMANCE
IT'S A NIGHTMARE
AND HOW OFTEN DO YOU DO IT
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THINGS FALL IN PLACE
IN SPORTS IT'S NOT POSSIBLE
CULTURE IN BUSINESS IS THE WAY PEOPLE BEHAVE IN YOUR ORGANIZATION
EVERYBODY IN A SPORTS TEAM KNOWS IT'S ABOUT WINNING THE GAME
AND THE POSITIVE RESULTS OF THAT PERIOD ALL THOSE WONDERFUL DEVICES APPLE CREATED STAYS WITH US AS WE SPEAK
IT'S NOT ABOUT YOUR PERFORMANCE IT'S ABOUT THEIR PERFORMANCE
OFTEN A VERY THEORETICAL ONE
AS CEO OF THE COMPANY HE FOUNDED
WHEN WE'VE GIVEN IT ALL WE'VE GOT WE ARE AS PERFECT AS WE CAN BE
THERE IS NO BABY PANIC
AND THERE ARE RISKS THAT YOUR CHILD MIGHT HAVE A PROBLEM
WHICH IT MAKES SENSE RIGHT
IN SOME PLACES THESE ARE AVAILABLE
SO OF COURSE WHEN THE TIME CAME I WAS ON TOP OF THAT
AND THERE SHOULDN'T BE
AND I KNOW THAT I AM NOT ALONE
WE NEED TO STOP DOING THAT
DO I WANT TO RISK MY TRAINING THE PROFITABILITY I HAVE THE CAREER I WORKED FOR TO
IT IS STILL MY WAY
I'M NOT SURE HOW I FEEL ABOUT THAT
BUT THEN I LOOK AROUND THEN I THINK OH
IT HAS TO HAPPEN BY 35
I EVEN ALMOST HAVE PH
I'M NOT EVEN SURE WHAT A PLAN WOULD LOOK LIKE
LOTS OF WOMEN ARE WAITING TO HAVE CHILDREN OR DECIDING NOT TO HAVE CHILDREN
IT HAS TO HAPPEN BY 30
LOTS OF WOMEN DON'T WANT TO HAVE KIDS
ALSO IN 1970 ONLY 1 OUT OF 100 WOMEN HAD A BABY PAST AGE
WHICH IS A GREAT THING
WHAT THEY WERE THINKING ABOUT IT
THE WOMEN WHO ARE WORRIED ARE THE ONES WHO REALLY CARE ABOUT THIS TOPIC
I DID MY RESEARCH I MADE AN APPOINTMENT WAY AHEAD OF TIME I READ EVERYTHING
BUT I DON'T HAVE A PLAN
I WAS ON TOP OF THAT
HAVING A BABY WITHOUT ENOUGH FOLIC ACID IN MY BLOOD WAS BAD
THERE IS NOBODY SAYING
THAT WAS THE AVERAGE AGE TO HAVE HER FIRST CHILD
AND THERE ARE POLICIES THAT WORK GREAT FOR THAT
AND THAT WAS DIFFERENT ACROSS THE BOARD
THEY ARE WORRYING ABOUT IT ALONG WITH OTHER THINGS LIKE HOW THEY ARE GOING TO PAY THE BILLS HOW THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR PARENTS
IT WAS MY WAY
WOMEN JUST REALLY WANTED TO PARTICIPATE
AND THEN FOURTH I FOUND THAT HIGH LEVELS OF WORRY ABOUT FUTURE FERTILITY WERE NOT
AND HERE IS WHAT I FOUND
AND I AM REALLY EXCITED TO BE TALKING TO THEM ABOUT IT
AND AMID THIS COMPLICATED SET OF FACTORS THOUGH WE SEE IN THE MEDIA
IN 2008 THE AVERAGE AGE FOR A WOMAN TO HAVE HER FIRST CHILD WAS 25
WITH THIS STUFF I CAN MAKE IT DISSOLVE IN ABOUT A WEEK
IT BUFFERS THE WATER
SO WE'RE ALREADY ABLE TO MANUFACTURE
NOW THAT WOULD BE USEFUL IF YOU'RE WORKING IN MARITIME INDUSTRY AND YOU'RE TRYING TO PROTECT YOUR
BUT WE HAD TO COME BACK
AND THEN IT WOULD DISSOLVE
BUT WE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO UNDERSTAND IT
THERE IS SOMETHING THAT MADE IT THAT WAY
IN BOLTZMANN'S SCENARIO IF YOU WANT TO MAKE AN APPLE PIE YOU JUST WAIT FOR THE RANDOM MOTION OF ATOMS TO MAKE YOU AN
AND WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT
ARE YOU GOOD AT IT
THAT MEANS IF YOU WANT TO SAVE LIVES YOU CAN DO IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY
AND ACTUALLY FROM THAT DAY ON SHE'S BEEN COMFORTABLE WITH US
AND I WOULD JUST ADD WE SAW THE SAME THING WITH SARS
AND I THINK MY TIME IS UP
BUT WE DON'T REALLY KNOW
SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO ALL OUT THERMONUCLEAR RESPONSE STIMULATE THE TOTAL CYTOKINE CASCADE
AND SO FAR IN THE H5N1 CASES IN PEOPLE SIMILARLY BACTERIAL INFECTION HAS NOT BEEN AN ISSUE AT
WHAT MASK WORKS WHAT MASK DOESN'T WORK
I COULD GIVE YOU A BUNCH OF FLIP THIS THAT AND THE OTHER
BECAUSE WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER REFUGEES AND LOCAL CITIZENS ADDING UP
TRY TO ASK HIM WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO HERE
I ENJOYED WORKING IN AN OPEN AND DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT BASED
SO REFUGEES CAN BE POTENTIAL PARTNERS AND RESOURCES OF ECONOMIC CHANGE
YES I AGREE
AND I REFUSED TO PLAY EVEN THAT UNLESS I GOT TO BE THE DOCTOR
WHY COULD MY HOME BE A MUSEUM
I NEVER THOUGHT AGAIN ABOUT THE MATTER
WE EITHER SAW THE LAUNCHES FROM OUR BACKYARD OR WE SAW IT BY DRIVING IN THE HOUR OVER TO THE CAPE
IT'S AN ENGINEER'S DREAM TO WORK WITH THAT GROUP OF PEOPLE
AND I ALSO AT THE SAME TIME WANTED TO THANK MY FRIENDS AT GOOGLE BOTH FOR SUPPORTING ME DURING THIS EFFORT
WE NEED TO CREATE A CONVERSATION AROUND THESE SHARED VALUES AND AROUND HOW CLIMATE CHANGE IS AFFECTING ALL
THE MEDIA MAY NOT TELL US WHAT TO THINK BUT THEY TELL US WHAT TO THINK ABOUT AND IT'S NOT GLOBAL WARMING
THE SOLUTIONS TO CLIMATE CHANGE ARE HERE AND AVAILABLE TO US NOW AND THEY OFFER SUCH A
SO WHAT CAN WE DO
SOME ASPECTS OF THIS FAILURE ARE INADVERTENT AND INNOCENT LIKE HOW SOME SCIENTISTS COMMUNICATE
WHEN I FIRST STARTED WORKING WITH CLIMATE SCIENTISTS I REALIZED THAT PEOPLE HAD A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING SOME OF THEM
ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE HAPPENING NOW
IT BECAME A BOOK
IT BECAME A SHOW
WE GAVE THIS LAND BACK TO NATURE
SO STRESS IS SOMETHING OF AN EVENT THAT IS OUT OF OUR CONTROL THAT WE FEEL WE CAN'T COPE WITH AND CAUSES A
THIS MEANS THEY ARE UNDER REGULATION OF THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM DURING STRESS
SO HOW DOES THE PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSE TO STRESS MANIFEST IN THE MODERN ERA
PUT SIMPLY IT'S A SITUATION OR AN EVENT THAT EXCEEDS OR IS PERCEIVED TO EXCEED
SO WE REALLY NEED TO ENCOURAGE THE POLICY MAKERS TO TAKE STRESS SERIOUSLY AND PUT IT UPON THE
SO IT'S A GOOD THING IT'S OUR FIGHT AND FLIGHT RESPONSE IT PROMOTES THE SURVIVAL OF THE
AND WE MAY BE ABLE TO IMPROVE THEIR IMMUNE FUNCTION AND IMPROVE THEIR OVERALL WELLBEING
IT PROMOTES A PROTECTION AGAINST INFECTIONS
AND WE NEED TO ENGAGE THE POLICY MAKERS
BUT DESPITE THIS AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT STRESS MANAGEMENT IS EASY AND AFFORDABLE TO
AND IN THE INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE VERY LITTLE SOCIAL SUPPORT IF YOU ACTUALLY PROVIDE THEM WITH A SUPPORT NETWORK THEIR IMMUNE
AND THIS MAY HELP US PROMOTE BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES
ONLY THE SOLDIERS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM RESPOND
THESE ARE SOME OF THE BIGGEST KILLERS CURRENTLY IN SOCIETY
AND THIS RESULTS IN AN EMOTIONAL RESPONSE AND A BIOLOGICAL ADAPTATION SUCH AS
BECAUSE THERE IS SUCH A STIGMA ASSOCIATED WITH STRESS AND MENTAL HEALTH
YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT THE TYPES OF STRESSES WE FACE IN THE MODERN WORLD ARE VERY DIFFERENT TO OUR CAVEMEN
BUT IF NOT WE BECOME STRESSED
IT'S ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THE MOST COMMON DISEASES FACING THE MODERN WORLD SUCH
AND BY ADMISSION THEY ARE ALSO THE ONES THAT OFTEN FALL FLAT ON THEIR FACE AND FAIL
WHAT IS IT YOU WANT TO GO AND ACHIEVE
HE'S AN EX BRITISH
AND REMARKABLY SHE SAID YES
THEY DON'T LIKE TO BE CALLED ARMY
MY LIFE EXPECTANCY WOULD BE REDUCED
THAT IS THEY KEEP US ALIVE THEY GET US INTO WHEELCHAIRS AND WE CAN GO AND LIVE LIFE
I'VE GOT PROBLEMS
AND THAT'S WHY I'M EXCITED ABOUT IT BECAUSE THAT'S THE DOMAIN I LIVE IN
HE'S ACTUALLY EX ROYAL MARINES
BUT I ALSO LEARNED THAT I WAS GOING TO SUFFER FROM LACK OF BLADDER CONTROL BOWEL CONTROL SEXUAL
AND I APPRECIATE IF YOU'VE GOT TO CHECK WITH YOUR HEALTH AND SAFETY PEOPLE TO ACCEPT MY ENTRY
TONY I'M BLIND
I WOULD HAVE SPASMS NEUROPATHIC PAIN INFECTIONS
AND AS I BREAK THE DEVICE THEY REDESIGN IT AND RETROFIT ALL THE DEVICES AROUND THE WORLD
IT IS REMARKABLE THAT THE FORMAL MEDICAL STRUCTURE HAS TURNED SPINAL INJURIES INTO A PREDICTABLE
AND I WAS SO SUPER CONFIDENT THAT I OF COURSE EXPECTED HER TO SAY YES
HE WASN'T INTERESTED IN MY RESUME A BIG LIST
BUT I WAS BUILDING UP TO THE BIG POINT
AND EARLIER THIS YEAR I SPENT THREE MONTHS IN UCLA WORKING WITH REGGIE AND YURY COMBINING MY
THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT
RUGBY CRICKET HOCKEY
BUT THIS TIME IT WASN'T TEMPORARY
UNABLE TO TELL THE TIME UNABLE TO TELL IF IT WAS DAY OR NIGHT WHEN I WENT TO BED FOR FIVE MINUTES AND
IT'S EXCITING STUFF
WE WERE PART OF DECISION MAKING
IT'S ONE OF TWO HOMES THAT THE OLIVE BRANCH RUNS THAT PROVIDES CHILDREN ORPHANED BY HIV AIDS WITH A HAPPY HOME
THE SCHOOLS ARE FILLED WITH POSITIVE MESSAGES AND POSTERS THAT FOSTER A SENSE OF EMPOWERMENT
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE BIG SCHOOLS AND MEDICAL FACILITIES OFFERED BY THE GOVERNMENT IN THE BIGGER TOWNS AND CITIES
BECAUSE OF HER THE MAJORITY OF THE CLIENTS IN THEIR WARD ARE ALSO UNAFRAID NOW TO SAY THAT THEY ARE HIV
EDINA ALSO HEADS UP THE PEACE HOME
I REALLY LIKED THE KIDS BUT EVEN MORE I LIKED THAT MY PLANK WAS HELPING THEM
AND I WAS LIKE WHY
APPARENTLY THE PLANK IS REALLY POPULAR IN CHINA
THEY HAVE EVERY KIND OF THERAPIST POSSIBLY IMAGINABLE
NOW THIS DOCTOR HAD NEVER REALLY BEEN MY DOCTOR BUT HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN THERE WHEN MY
THE WORD ITSELF SAYS I'M POSSIBLE
NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE
I WAS LIKE NOTHING
NO ONE EVER TREATED ME LIKE I WAS DIFFERENT AND MY PARENTS ALWAYS LET ME TRY WHATEVER I WANTED
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ON MONDAY AND TUESDAY
IN NOVEMBER I UNDERWENT SURGERY AND SPENT A FEW WEEKS RECOVERING
I HAD NEVER BEEN ON TV
BUT BEFORE GOING TO 5D LET'S GO BACK TO A BIT OF CALCULUS
AND LET'S SAY HE DOES PUSH OUT OF THE PAPER
HOWEVER HOW MANY OF US ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT SUCH A THING MEANS
AND WHEN WE'RE ASKED WHAT THE FOURTH DIMENSION COULD BE WE'RE USUALLY MET WITH THE ANSWER OF IT IS TIME
IF WE WERE TO INTEGRATE A 3D OBJECT WHAT DO WE GET
WHAT WOULD HE HAVE TO DO
THE STICKMAN FIGURE
HOW DO YOU DO THIS
NO ONE REALLY KNOWS
WE CAN ONLY THEORIZE ABOUT THIS
AND PUT THEM INTO ONE SPECIFIC REEL
AND IF WE WERE TO INTEGRATE A 2D AREA ON A 2D GRAPH WE WOULD USUALLY GET THE 3D VOLUME UNDER IT
SO FOLLOWING THE SAME PATTERN IF WE WERE TO INTEGRATE A 3D OBJECT WE WOULD GET A FOURTH
WE COMMONLY UNDERSTAND DIMENSIONS AS A THING OF THE SCIENCE FICTION
I WENT TO THE PLACE WHERE HE SLEEPS
HE SAID TO ME IT'S LATE NOTICE SO WE WON'T BE ABLE TO PAY YOU AND HE WALKED OUT
LET THIS BE A CAUTIONARY TALE FOR YOU
CAN YOU COVER HIS SHIFT TOMORROW
IT'S QUITE TASTY
SO RATHER THAN HAVING 10 OYSTERS YOU HAVE 10000 OYSTERS
THE WATER IS COMPLETELY BLACK
AND I DON'T WHERE I GOT IT FROM BUT I WAS ABLE TO SOMEHOW PULL MYSELF UP AND AS
THAT'S NOT THE WORST PART OF IT
THE WATER IS MINUS 1
THIS IS THE TIME TO SWIM WITH REAL HUMILITY
MANY MANY PEOPLE HAVE DIED ON MT
SO IT'S RIGHT UP IN THE HEAVENS
IT'S VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO BREATH
YOU GET ALTITUDE SICKNESS
I WAS FOLLOWING
IT'S AN AIR THAT OPERATES QUITE A LOT LIKE A LIQUID
I WAS THE ONLY ONE OUT OF THE FINAL FOUR CANDIDATES THAT NEVER GOT A FRONT PAGE INTERVIEW
SO AT 238PM ON MONDAY WOMEN IN ICELAND LEFT WORK BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN THEY HAD EARNED THEIR
I DIDN'T EVEN GO DOWN TO DETAIL ABOUT THAT
IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FOR INSTANCE WE HAVE HAD AN ENORMOUS INCREASE IN ABUSE
WHEN I BECAME PRESIDENT THE DIFFERENCE WAS 39 PERCENT
SO WE'VE MADE SOME PROGRESS PARTIALLY BECAUSE I WAS PRESIDENT
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS
AND IT'S NOT ABOUT BEING YOUNG IT WASN'T ABOUT THAT PASSION IT WAS ACTUALLY ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE DIDN'T
SOMETIMES IT IS REALLY GOOD TO TAKE PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR COMFORT ZONE AND REALLY INTRODUCE THEM TO THE KIND OF INDIVIDUALS
WHY DON'T WE COLLECT SOME BOOKS
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE WORK THAT YOU HAVE DONE
THE THIRD OPTION THAT ONE COULD CONSIDER IS GOING INTO A BIG CORPORATE A BIG BANK
SO IT STARTED WITH MY VOLUNTEER GROUP AS IN US FOR THEM LET'S GIVE THEM CRAYONS AND WE
AND WE NEED THAT BY PEOPLE WORKING FROM WITHIN AND REALLY LEARNING PARTS OF THE BUSINESS AND SEEING HOW THEY CAN
HOW BUSINESS CAN BE A FORCE FOR GOOD LET'S SAY WAS THE TITLE
WE PACKED THEM UP PACKAGED THEM YEAR ON YEAR SENT THEM OUT
ALL OF THAT STUFF A FEW YEARS AGO
I ENDED UP WORKING ON A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE WHERE THE SMOKING RATES AND SMOKING
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE MAYBE YOU ARE THINKING
THINK ABOUT THE PROBLEM YOU WANT TO SOLVE AND HOW YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO THAT AT SCALE
SO WHILE THEY REALLY APPRECIATE THOSE CRAYONS I'M JUST WONDERING IF YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP US OUT WITH A
90 OF THE SMOKERS STARTED BEFORE THE AGE OF 18
THIS ACTIVISM BECAME AN US VERSUS THEM
WE NEED ENTREPRENEURS BUT NOT EVERYONE IS AN ENTREPRENEUR
WE WENT CITY BY CITY STATE BY STATE RALLYING TO GET SMOKE FREE WORKPLACES TO
I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING ABOUT YOUR JOURNEY
THEY MIGHT NEED MORE BOOKS IF THEY'VE BEEN DESTROYED BY THE STORM
YOU CAN USE THE MARKETS TO INCENTIVIZE GOOD BEHAVIORS AND GOOD OUTCOMES
MY MUM HAS BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER
SO AS I THOUGHT THROUGH THAT AND THOUGHT HOW CAN I AVOID THIS FROM EVER HAPPENING AGAIN I GOT INTO AN EVEN MESSIER
THEY ARE ALSO GETTING REALLY SICK WHEN THEY ARRIVE BECAUSE THERE IS NO CLEAN WATER AT THEIR SCHOOL
WHEN I SAY SCHOOL I ACTUALLY MEAN THEY ARE STUDYING IN CHICKEN COOPS THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE A
OK I AM GOING TO RUN OFF AND BE AN ENTREPRENEUR
HOW COULD THEY BE SELLING PRODUCTS THAT WERE SO HARMFUL
I WAS SITTING NEXT TO A TOBACCO INDUSTRY EXECUTIVE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WE GOT SORT OF DOODLED SCRIBBLED CARDS BACK FROM THE STUDENTS IN AFRICA SAYING
OR HOW ABOUT WE KNIT HATS FOR KIDS WITH CANCER
AND IT WAS FUN IT WAS EXCITING IT WAS AD HOC IT WAS REACTIVE
YOU ALSO NEED TO RECOGNIZE IT IS A TOOL AND THAT WE NEED TO USE IT WELL AND IT IS AN ENTRY POINT
THIS IS A BIGGER PROBLEM THAN JUST US
IT WAS GOING SO WELL THAT WE SET OUR SIGHTS GLOBALLY
I SAT DOWN ON THAT PANEL I SAID IT TO HER I DON'T THINK SHE TOOK IT UP BUT I SAID IT ANYWAY AND FROM
HOW COULD THEY BE DOING THAT TO OUR GENERATION
IT WAS LIKE A MUD LIKE LAVA FLOW HAD SWEPT OVER THE LANDSCAPE IN THE MOST UNIMAGINABLE
MY LIFE WILL NOT BE DEFINED BY THE BAD CHOICES THAT I'VE MADE OR COULD MAKE
IT WILL BE DEFINED BY MY WILLINGNESS TO GIVE BACK MORE THAN I TAKE
WHEN HE PUTS HIS MIND TO IT
REALIZE THAT LIFE IS SHORT AND TOO PRECIOUS TO SQUANDER
BEING ABLE TO SEE THE WORLD IN ALL ITS GLORY BEING ABLE TO HAVE MORE THAN JUST A PRISON STORY
NOW WHEN WE GO FEWER AND FEWER BUSINESSES CLOSE FOR SIESTA REFLECTING THE
THEY GOT MARRIED FIVE YEARS AGO AND NOW THEY HAVE TWO YEAR OLD TWINS
AND WHAT CRITERIA SHOULD THEY USE TO MAKE THAT DECISION
TWENTY YEARS AGO WHEN MY FAMILY FIRST STARTED GOING TO ITALY WE USED TO LUXURIATE IN THE CULTURE OF
AT LEAST IF WE GET BEYOND A BARTER ECONOMY SOMEBODY HAS TO EARN AN INCOME AND
LET'S BRING THEM BOTH TOGETHER
THEY TAKE PATERNITY LEAVE WHEN THEY CAN
IT'S CERTAINLY NOT COMPLETE
AS THAT'S NOT FAIR
OR SWITZERLAND THAT HAVE HIGHER AVERAGE LEVELS OF INCOME BUT LOWER
MEN ARE STILL SOCIALIZED TO BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE TO BE BREADWINNERS THAT TO
SIESTA IS NOT JUST ABOUT AVOIDING THE HEAT OF THE DAY
IF YOU WORK FOR ME AND YOU HAVE A FAMILY ISSUE I EXPECT YOU TO ATTEND TO
THINK ABOUT A LAWYER WHO SPENDS PART OF HIS TIME AT SCHOOL EVENTS FOR HIS KIDS
AND A 2012 STUDY OF EMPLOYERS SHOWED THAT DEEP FLEXIBLE
I FOUND A COUPLE IN THE WORK OF MATT GROENING ALTHOUGH MATT GROENING TOLD ME LATER THAT HE COULD NOT MAKE MY TALK BECAUSE IT WAS A MORNING
I REMEMBER BRINGING THEM ALL TO MY FAVORITE CORNER TABLE AND I READ POEMS PAIRED
THEY PLAYED ALONG
SO MY TALK HAD SOME OF MY FOUR IN THE MORNING EXAMPLES BUT IT ALSO HAD EXAMPLES FROM MY FELLOW TED SPEAKERS
BUT THEY FOLLOWED THE PATTERN
MUCH OF IT WAS CONTENT I NEVER WOULD HAVE FOUND ON MY OWN IF I WAS LOOKING FOR IT AND I WAS NOT
COM LAUNCHED LATER THAT YEAR WITH A BUNCH OF VIDEOS FROM PAST TALKS INCLUDING MINE AND I STARTED RECEIVING FOUR IN THE
MAYBE THIS WAS SOME KIND OF CLICHE THAT HAD NEVER BEEN TAXONOMIZED BEFORE
MAYBE I WAS ON THE TRAIL OF A NEW MEME OR SOMETHING
I FOUND FOUR IN THE MORNING IN A NOVEL BY ISABEL ALLENDE
SECONDLY I DID A LITTLE RESEARCH
THERE ARE A COUPLE THREE IN THE MORNINGS IN SHAKESPEARE
THERE'S A FIVE IN THE MORNING
AND WHEN A SPOT OPENED UP IN THE KITCHEN HE OFFERED IT TO THE GUY
THIS IS WHAT WE WANT FOR TEENAGERS
HE WAS REALLY AT RISK OF NOT MAKING IT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL
I CAN'T WAIT TO TELL YOU ABOUT MY PLANS FOR THE WEEKEND
AND WHEN I SAY GROWING UP
I THINK YOU'VE GOT SOME SAY
I'M ETCHED IN THEIR SOULS AS THEY ARE ETCHED IN MINE ON THIS LIFE LONG JOURNEY OF DISCOVERY AND COMMUNICATION
WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND
AND ONE AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE HAVE LIKED ME
I SAID WHAT IS IT
REMEMBER THE DOUBLE INCOME NO KIDS
APART FROM THAT THERE WAS THE DECADE OF THE BABY BOOMERS
YOU HAVE LIKE THIS VIRTUAL UMBILICAL CORD TO STAY IN CONTACT WITH YOUR FAMILY WITH YOUR FRIENDS EVEN WITH
WE ASK THE EASY AND VERY PROFOUND QUESTION
BUT HOW ABOUT THE SKIPPIES
SO 40 MORE USERS WITHIN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME
BUT BACK TO MY TOPIC
AND THE SECOND THING OF COURSE IS THE MOMENT YOU ARE GETTING MARRIED
THE BEST AGER THE GOLDEN AGER WE ARE ALL AWARE OF THEM
BEFORE THAT WE BASICALLY E
WITH SEX IT'S THE OTHER WAY AROUND
TELEVISION IS ALWAYS RANKED NUMBER ONE
I'M NOT SURE
IT'S ALWAYS INTERESTING WHEN I ASK MY STUDENTS AT UNIVERSITY
BUT IF YOU ONLY HAVE A LOW EDUCATION ONLY ONE OUT OF THREE HAS THE CHANCE TO GO ONLINE
WE ARE DOING SO MANY THINGS
SO HOW ABOUT THE PRESENT
ONLY ONE OUT OF FIVE GERMANS WOULD LIKE TO WATCH MORE TV
ONLY 24 WOULD LIKE TO USE THE INTERNET MORE OFTEN
SO NO SURPRISE THAT A NEW INDUSTRY DEVELOPED IN OUR COUNTRY
WE LIKE CERTAIN THINGS
TAKE FOR EXAMPLE TELEVISION
THE MOMENT YOU START WORKING YOU DO NOT HAVE THE TIME TO BE ONLINE ALL THE TIME
THE FUTURE OF LEISURE TIME
MOST OF THEM LOOK AT ME AND SAY
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
HOW WILL THE FUTURE LOOK LIKE
AND WHEN I TELL THEM
HAVING MORE TIME FOR THE FAMILY MORE TIME FOR THEIR FRIENDS MORE TIME FOR THEIR TEAM MATES FOR THEIR NEIGHBORS
NOW THE PROBLEM IS NOT THAT DO NOT HAVE ACCESS
INSTEAD THEY RELISH THE CHALLENGE AND ENJOY SOLVING THE RIDDLE OF HOW TO GET THEIR ROBOT BETTER WITH EACH
SO PICTURE THIS
OUR JOB IS TO PICK THE APPROPRIATE ONES AND PAVE OVER THEM
THEY'LL ALWAYS FIND THE SHORTCUT
THE ANSWER IS RARELY INSIDE THE BUILDING
NOW UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES ARE FANTASTIC FOR SPOTTING DESIRE PATHS
I THINK IT'S BECAUSE STUDENTS ARE ALWAYS LATE AND THEY'RE PRETTY SMART
SO THEY'RE DASHING TO LECTURES
OUR NEW GOAL SHOULD BE THAT WHEN EVERY FAMILY THINKS ABOUT WHERE THEY WANT TO LIVE AND WORK THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO
LET'S TALK ABOUT MENTAL TIME TRAVEL
NOT JUST ABOUT SIZE BUT THEN ALSO ABOUT HOW IS IT WIRED HOW ARE THE NEURAL PATHWAYS MOVING
BUT WHAT WE'RE NOT SEEING IS THOSE KINDS OF BEHAVIOURS THAT MAKE US GO
THESE ARE ACTUALLY VERY UNUSUAL THINGS
BASICALLY WHAT IT SUGGESTS TO ME I CAN'T GIVE YOU A DEFINITIVE ANSWER AND SAY YES ABSOLUTELY THERE
WHY ARE THEY DEPICTING THIS
THEY LIVE OUT IN THE DESERT AND STILL PRACTICE THE HUNTER GATHERER LIFESTYLE
SO WHAT'S GOING ON
AND SO THIS IS WHERE WHAT I'VE LOOKED AT IS CAN WE FIND THOSE IN THE CAVES IN EUROPE
THAT PARTICULAR ONE IS ABOUT 32000 YEARS OLD
AND WHAT'S SO FASCINATING ABOUT THE EARLY HUMANS IN AFRICA IS THAT FOR PROBABLY ABOUT THE FIRST
AND GUESS WHAT
AND ALSO WHAT WE FIND WITH THESE EARLY TOOLMAKERS IS THAT THEY ACTUALLY WERE EXHIBITING
THEY SHOW UP IN EUROPE SOMEWHERE AROUND 40000 EVEN 45000 IN SOME SPOTS AND THEY SPREAD OUT AROUND THERE
NOW WHAT I MEAN WHEN I SAY MENTAL TIME TRAVEL IS THE ABILITY TO THINK ABOUT PAST AND FUTURE
SO NOT SOMETHING THAT'S USEFUL AT A VERY 1
BUT THE QUESTION THAT'S COME UP IS
AGAIN COMING BACK TO THAT THAT DOESN'T EXIST ANYWHERE IN NATURE
SIMILAR TO ENHANCED WORKING MEMORY THERE'S ACTUALLY SEVERAL PARTS OF THE BRAIN THAT ARE ALL KIND OF WORKING TOGETHER
SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
AND THIS IS KIND OF THE STORY GOING FORWARD AND THIS IS AGAIN WHERE WYNN AND COOLIDGE HAVE MADE THIS
HEAD OF A LION BODY OF A HUMAN
THAT ONCE YOU GO INTO A CAVE WE GO IN WITH HEADLAMPS AND LOTS OF LIGHT AND WE KNOW WHAT A CAVE IS GEOLOGICALLY
SO LOTS OF THINGS TO EAT WHICH WAS KIND OF A PULL FACTOR THAT PROBABLY KEPT MODERN HUMANS THERE
SO AGAIN THAT SUGGESTS SOME SORT OF HARNESSING OF SOME UNSEEN WORLD THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON
THEY'RE MAKING REALLY NICE TOOLS SURVIVING QUITE WELL MAKING GOOD USE OF THEIR LANDSCAPE ALL OF THOSE TYPES OF THINGS ARE IN
THIS IS NOT A SELF REPRESENTATION
THIS PARTICULAR ONE IS THE ADULT MALE AND IT'S ABOUT 28000 YEARS OLD IT'S FROM RUSSIA
BECAUSE THAT IS THE REALITY IS IF WE GO FAR ENOUGH BACK INTO OUR OWN DEEP HISTORY THERE
THEY STILL DO ROCK ART
IS IT POSSIBLE
SO PRE PLANNING BUT EVEN AT A GREATER DEGREE
SO YOU PROBABLY SAW I SAID THE GOD SPOT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THERE IS THAT
SO IF WE'RE CAPABLE OF IT WHY WOULDN'T THEY HAVE BEEN
SO SOMETHING IS DEFINITELY GOING ON IN THAT SENSE
HUGE HERDS OF BISON AND MAMMOTH AND ALL THESE OTHER THINGS ON THE LANDSCAPE
WHAT IF THEY WERE WEARING A MASK
IT'S INCREDIBLY SUBJECTIVE RIGHT
SO OBVIOUSLY HOMO SAPIENS AT THE TOP
ARE WE SEEING ON THE WALLS POTENTIALLY SOME OF THE TRANCE LIKE IMAGERY WHICH THEY HAVE
THEN ON TOP OF THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE FACT THAT THE TWO OTHER BURIALS AT THAT PARTICULAR SITE ARE ACTUALLY OF TWO
IT AFFECTS EVERYTHING FROM SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS THE HOLIDAYS WE CELEBRATE TO THE NAMES THAT WE GIVE OUR CHILDREN
SOMETHING THAT'S SAY HALF ANIMAL HALF HUMAN WOULD BE AN IMPOSSIBLE ENTITY
SO NOW WE GET SPECIFICALLY TO A RESEARCH PROJECT THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON WHERE I SAID OKAY WELL LET'S TRY
MAYBE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AS EARLY AS 60000 SO SOMEWHERE IN THAT 40 60000 RANGE IS WHEN MODERN HUMANS
MY GRANDMOTHER ONLY WENT TO MIDDLE SCHOOL
THAT'S ABOUT RAISING THE BAR
AND SOMETIMES WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES LIKE LANGUAGE OR IF YOU THINK ABOUT ARTS OR
IT SEEMED SO FAR SO REMOTE
TO THEM IF I COULD JUST GET A COLLEGE EDUCATION I WOULD BE OK
WHAT WE DID THIS YEAR WAS VERY INTERESTING AS WELL
AND WHEN I LOOK AT SCHOOLS IN NEW YORK AND SOME OF THEM IN PROVIDENCE I REALIZE YOU KNOW THAT AMERICAN DREAM THAT I
IF YOU DON'T KNOW IT EXISTS COULD YOU BECOME IT
WHY IS THAT
BUT WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT IS MY GRANDPARENTS WHICH YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE THEM
AND I SAID YOU CAN'T GET ONE PERSON TO SIGN UP FOR THIS TRIP
AND THEY RAISED ME AND THEY POURED ALL THEIR HOPES AND DREAMS
I COULD STILL AGAIN BREAK THAT POVERTY CYCLE
BUT THAT WAS ABOUT THE HOPE THAT THEY GAVE ME
I FELT LIKE WE WERE ON TO SOMETHING ABOUT GIVING THEM AND EXPOSING TO CAREERS WE THOUGHT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO GIVE THEM
GOSH THEY TOLD ME THIS ABOUT EDUCATION
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
THEY WON'T BE AFRAID OF IT
IT IS ABOUT OPENNING THESE CHILDREN UP TO OPPORTUNITIES THAT THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE KNOWN EXISTED BUT NOW THAT THEY
HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY THINK THAT YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE CHANGE
THEY HAVE TO DO A SMALL FUNDRAISER BUT IF THEY CAN'T BRING UP THE MONEY WE'LL HELP THEM GET THERE
BUT IT'S NOT PROBABLE
HOW WILL WE BE TREATED WHEN WE'RE THERE
IT MADE ME SMILE BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY WHETHER SHE IS A HAIR STYLIST USING HER LANGUAGE OR
AND THIS HAPPENS ON A REGULAR BASIS
AND WHEN I STAND HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY AND I SAY THAT YOU KNOW AGAIN I GREW UP DURING A TIME WHERE I COULD BE
LIKE THAT WAS JUST THE HOLY GRAIL
THEY BELIEVED DEEPLY THAT IF I WAS ABLE TO GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE THAT I WOULDN'T BE DESTINED TO A
AND IT ALSO ALLOWS THEM TO EXPLORE THEIR HORIZONS
THE PARENTS DIDN'T WANT THEIR CHILDREN GOING THAT FAR
AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANTED TO DO AROUND LANGUAGES
MY GRANDFATHER ON MY RIGHT HAND SIDE HE GREW UP IN THE SEGREGATED SOUTH
SO MY IDEA AROUND CHANGE AND WHAT GLOBAL LANGUAGE PROJECT IS ALL ABOUT IS TAKING
THAT'S MY PASSION
I WAS A DAUGHTER OF A TEENAGER MOTHER WHO WAS A DAUGHTER OF A TEENAGER MOTHER
AND WHAT THE KIDS AND THE CLASS STARTED TO BELIEVE WAS THAT THEY WERE SPECIAL
THEY ARE RESERVED FOR STUDENTS WHO HAVE PARENTS WHO CAN AFFORD AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS LANGUAGE PROGRAMS
THEY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THEM
AND THEY WERE GOING TO GIVE A GROUP OF TEENS THE CHANCE TO GO TO COLOMBIA THE COUNTRY FOR 2
BUT THINK ABOUT WHAT IMPACT THIS WOULD HAVE
SO HOW DID WE GET THERE
AND WOMEN'S MATE PREFERENCES SIMILARLY CHANGE OVER THE CYCLE SO THAT THEY PREFER MORE DOMINANT MORE MASCULINE MALES
IF WOMEN WERE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE ORGASMS WITH SOME MEN THAN OTHERS THEN THIS COULD BE A MECHANISM BY WHICH THEY
SO THAT'S ONE POINT THAT I WANT TO MAKE
SO MALE PROVISIONING BOTH POSSIBLE THROUGH HUNTING AND NECESSARY
THE AVERAGE MAN IS STRONGER THAN 99
SO THAT'S A BIG CHANGE
LAWRENCE ISLAND IN 1997 WHEN I WAS A GRADUATE STUDENT IN THE UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA AT FAIRBANKS AND I JOURNEYED
LAWRENCE ISLAND IN BERING STRAIT TO RECORD THE STORIES AND MEANINGS BEHIND THE LAST GENERATION OF TATTOO
THERE ARE ALSO TATTOOS THAT MARKED IMPORTANT RITE OF PASSAGE CEREMONIES AND THERE WERE OTHER TATTOOS THAT CURED
THE RESULTING THIN LAYER IS THE ACTIVE LAYER ABSORBING THE ENERGY OF THE SUN
TODAY'S SITUATION IS MORE LIKE MY OTHER SHOE
THEY JUST DON'T MATCH
THAT'S A STABLE AND HEALTHY CONDITION
I HOPE ORGANIC PHOTOVOLTAICS WILL BE A BIG PART OF THIS
YOU MAY WONDER WHY THIS HEXAGONAL SHAPE WAS CHOSEN FOR THE SOLAR CELLS
IMAGINE THE SAILS OF THE SYDNEY OPERA AS POWER PLANTS
THEY PROVIDED SHADING DURING THE DAY AND ELECTRICITY FOR THE LIGHTING IN THE EVENING
THESE TWO COMPOUNDS ARE MIXED AND DISSOLVED TO BECOME AN INK
THEY DO OFFER A GOOD COST PERFORMANCE RATIO BUT THEY AREN'T REALLY FLEXIBLE IN TERMS OF THEIR DESIGN AND THIS MAKES
THIS IS THE REASON WHY WE DON'T SEE MANY SOLAR CELLS ON BUILDINGS TODAY
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE BOOKS SO MUCH MORE PERSONAL FOR YOU
THIS IS THE BOUNDARY OF WHAT THE BOOK CAN BE
ARE PRINT BOOKS DEAD
WHEN THEY START USING IT THEY DISCOVER SOMETHING RIGHT AWAY
THAT CHANGES A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT
IT'S CLEAR THAT WE NEED BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH TO UNDERSTAND THIS
FINALLY AFTER I DON'T KNOW 15 MINUTES PROBABLY OF BEGGING AND CRYING SHE
THE ONLY THOUGHTS THAT I COULD THINK OF WERE GOING TO HAPPEN TO ME WERE
SO I HAVE TO ENCOURAGE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU
I KNOW THAT WHEN WE ARE FACED WITH TRIALS WE HAVE A CHOICE
HOW HAD JUST YESTERDAY I HAD BEEN AT SCHOOL WITH MY FRIENDS HOW HAD JUST YESTERDAY I'D BEEN AT
AND SO HERE THIS MAN WAS TELLING ME THAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO CONSUMMATE OUR MARRIAGE AND I MAY HAVE GROWN UP
I WISH I COULD BE ONE OF THOSE CHILDREN BECAUSE NO ONE WILL EVER HURT THEM AGAIN
THERE WAS A TENT SET UP
THEY ARE SO LUCKY
I REMEMBER SITTING THERE AND CRYING AND CRYING AND THINKING OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO
FINALLY SOME PART OF ME PULLED MYSELF TOGETHER LONG ENOUGH TO HEAR HIM SAY THE WORDS THAT I
WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN TO ME
THE BEST PUNISHMENT YOU COULD EVER GIVE HIM IS TO BE HAPPY IS TO MOVE FORWARD WITH YOUR LIFE
THERE ARE DAYS WHEN WE WISH WE COULD PULL THE COVERS BACK UP AND HIBERNATE
BUT WE ALL HAVE A CHOICE TO MAKE
I REMEMBER BEGGING AND PLEADING AND CRYING AND TRIED TO COME UP WITH EVERY
I WILL NEVER FORGET FEELING THAT NO MATTER WHAT LAY IN FRONT OF ME IT WAS GOING TO BE
THEY ARE THE LUCKY ONES
I AM GRATEFUL THAT I CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE
I WILL NEVER FORGET THE FIRST TIME I SAW MY DAD AFTER THE POLICE HAD STOPPED AND PICKED ME UP
HE'S GOING TO RAPE ME AND THEN HE'S GOING TO KILL ME BECAUSE NOBODY SURVIVES BEING KIDNAPPED
HOW HAD MY WORLD TURNED FROM DAY TO NIGHT AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO MY FAMILY
HAD THIS MAN GONE THROUGH MY HOUSE ALREADY AND MURDERED MY FAMILY
YOU'LL NEVER KNOW THE LIVES YOU'LL BE ABLE TO TOUCH
HE PULLED ME OFF THE BUCKET WHERE I'D BEEN SITTING ONTO THE GROUND WHERE HE RIPPED OFF THE ROBE I'D BEEN FORCED TO
NO ONE CAN NEVER DO THAT TO THEM AGAIN
SHE BROUGHT ME IN AND SHE SAT ME DOWN ON A BUCKET WHERE SHE TRIED TO SPONGE BATHE ME AND CHANGE ME OUT OF
I REMEMBER THIS STRANGE MAN TAKING ME WAY UP INTO THE MOUNTAINS BEHIND MY HOME ALL THE WHILE AT KNIFE
I MEAN I REMEMBER BEING BROUGHT SO FAR UP INTO THE MOUNTAINS
IT IS SO IMPORTANT
WE CROSSED RIGHT OVER THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN AND STARTED DOWN THE OTHER SIDE
WE CAN GIVE IN AND SURRENDER OR WE CAN FIGHT AND WE CAN MOVE FORWARD
I WILL NEVER FORGET
SO WHEN SOME VERY POLITICAL EXCITING MOMENTS HAPPENED YOU CAN
SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN BEHIND IT
BRIC COUNTRY MEANS BRAZIL RUSSIA INDIA AND CHINA
IT BECAME THE MEDIA PLATFORM OF 300 MILLION READERS
ONE SAID TO ME OUR PEOPLE USED TO GATHER IN CAFES TO WATCH FOOTBALL OR SOCCER
THE STORY OF MOTHER TO BABY TRANSMISSION CONVERTED RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES FROM BEING
SO FOR EXAMPLE I AM WORKING ON A FUTURE MOVEMENT WITH A GOAL OF ENDING AVOIDABLE
SO LET ME GROUND THAT IN A FEW PRACTICAL EXAMPLES
21ST CENTURY MOVEMENTS ARE BUILT THROUGH MASS PARTICIPATION THROUGH PEOPLE DISCOVERING A SENSE OF THEIR OWN
BUT THEY ARE EXPENSIVE AND THERE IS A SHORTAGE OF DOCTORS
WHAT'S WRONG IN OUR WORLD
CREATE UNEXPECTED ALLIANCES
SCIENCE BUDGETS ARE BEING SLASHED
AND IT'S NOT JUST AMERICA
BACK IN THE 20TH CENTURY IT WAS DIFFERENT SCIENCE CAPTURED THE PUBLIC
MY TAKE AWAY FROM THAT IS THAT IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE SOMEONE ELSE'S MIND YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOUR OWN
IT WILL GET YOU THROUGH THE OBSTACLES THAT YOU ARE INEVITABLY GOING TO FACE
REMEMBER THE WORDLE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME
SO IF THAT'S RIGHT WHY DID WE ONLY CAPTURE FOUR OUT OF THOSE 151 MINDS
NOW I'M GOING TO TRY A TRICK AND RECREATE AN EXPERIMENT FROM THIS MORNING
I THINK THIS IS WHAT DAVID DEUTSCH MEANT IN 2005 WHEN HE ENDED HIS OXFORD TEDTALK
THE SECOND IS THAT PROBLEMS ARE SOLUBLE
BECAUSE THAT DRIP DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A TICKING CLOCK
THESE ARE OUR FUTURE INNOVATORS OUR FUTURE DOERS
THEY BOTH GOT THE RIGHT ANSWER
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT
IT'LL NEVER REPLACE GREAT TEACHERS
IT'S JUST THE FIRST STEP TO A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF SUBJECT MATTER
WHAT IS A TEACHER TO DO EVEN A GREAT TEACHER LIKE WENDY
SO LET ME SHARE WITH YOU AN EXAMPLE THAT MIGHT HELP
I WON'T FORGET THAT SCENE BECAUSE THERE WASN'T MUCH LEARNING GOING ON BUT I ALSO WON'T FORGET HIS EYES
I DON'T WANT AN AD IN THE NEW YORKER AND MOST OF THESE WORKERS DON'T REALLY WANT IPHONES
HOW MUCH MONEY CAN I SAVE
I THANKED HER ASSUMING IT WAS FAKE LIKE ALMOST EVERYTHING ELSE FOR SALE IN DONGGUAN
WE NOW STAND ON THE VERGE OF ANOTHER REVOLUTION IN GEOLOCATION ACCURACY
BUT I USED MY POWERS OF DEDUCTION AND RECOGNIZED THAT CHARDONNAY AND SAUVIGNON BLANC WERE TWO SEPARATE TYPES OF WHITE WINE
THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED PROBLEM
I DIDN'T KNOW FOR EXAMPLE THAT YOU HAD TO GO TO LAW SCHOOL TO BE A LAWYER
SHE RECOGNIZED THE MESSAGE THAT MY COMMUNITY HAD FOR ME THAT MY CHOICES DIDN'T MATTER THAT THE DECK WAS
I DON'T MEAN TO DISCOUNT THESE STRUCTURAL BARRIERS
NOW I DON'T HAVE ALL OF THE ANSWERS
AND IT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT THE CASE THAT THERE WAS A LIBERAL BOX TO CHECK ON THE APPLICATION BUT IT
THESE ARE ALL INSTANCES OF CHILDHOOD TRAUMA AND THEY'RE PRETTY COMMONPLACE IN MY FAMILY
IF YOU'RE A LOW INCOME KID ALMOST HALF OF YOU FACE MULTIPLE INSTANCES OF CHILDHOOD TRAUMA
THE SOCIAL CAPITAL THAT I HAD WASN'T BUILT FOR 21ST CENTURY AMERICA AND IT SHOWED
WELL ONE THING THAT HAPPENED IS THAT MY GRANDPARENTS THE SAME GRANDPARENTS OF SETTING SOMEONE ON FIRE FAME THEY REALLY SHAPED UP
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU WANT TO
9 PERCENT AND I WAS READY TO SIGN ON THE DOTTED LINE
THIS IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT ISSUE
I REMEMBER I LEARNED THIS WHEN I GOT THE FINANCIAL AID LETTER FROM YALE FOR MYSELF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN
ECONOMISTS CALL THE VALUE THAT WE GAIN FROM OUR INFORMAL NETWORKS FROM OUR FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES
IT TAUGHT ME HOW TO MAKE A BED HOW TO DO LAUNDRY HOW TO WAKE UP EARLY HOW TO MANAGE MY FINANCES
YOU SEE IT AS SOMETHING THAT'S ACTIVELY CONSPIRING WHERE PEOPLE WITH POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL POWER ARE WORKING AGAINST
I COME FROM A FAMILY THAT DOESN'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY
IF YOU HAD LOOKED AT MY LIFE WHEN I WAS 14 YEARS OLD AND SAID WELL WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THIS KID
THESE THINGS ARE ALL IMPORTANT
SO WE THINK OF THE MARINE CORPS AS A MILITARY OUTFIT AND OF COURSE IT IS BUT FOR ME THE US MARINE CORPS WAS A FOUR YEAR CRASH
BECAUSE HE'D WORKED ALL OVER THE DEVELOPING WORLD
BUT I'M TRYING TO CONVINCE YOU THAT THE WATER IS SAFE
NOT BECAUSE ANYTHING GOES WRONG WITH THEM
HE'D WORKED IN LEPER COLONIES
WE WERE DOING A STUDY IN KENYA WHEN THERE WAS AN OUTBREAK OF CHOLERA
THAT WAS A CONCERN WE'VE HAD ALL THE WAY THROUGH
IF YOU'RE LUCKY YOU'LL HAVE A DONKEY TO CARRY IT FOR YOU
IN FACT WE VERY OFTEN FIND PROMOTING WATER TREATMENT ON THE BASIS OF IMPROVED FAMILY
HE'D WORKED IN REFUGEE CAMPS
IT'S BY FAR THE CHEAPEST METHOD OF WATER TREATMENT
SO HE MAY NOT HAVE INVENTED IT BUT HE WAS THE PERSON WHO INTRODUCED ME TO IT
AND THEY DID THIS 200 YEARS AGO
WE'LL FIND OUT
THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH IMMEDIATELY PUT ALL THE EMERGENCY INTERVENTIONS IN PLACE
CHILD DEVELOPMENT BENEFIT
SO THEY GET A DOUBLE WHAMMY
AND YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF WELL WHY IS THAT
AND WHO CAN RESIST AN OPENING LINE LIKE THAT
AND HE'D NOTICED THAT NO MATTER HOW POOR A SITUATION THERE WAS ALWAYS A WELL KNOWN FIZZY DRINK ON
I BELIEVE YOU'RE THE NEW PHYSICIST CHAPPY
CHILD HEALTH BENEFIT
SO WE ALWAYS SAY REPLACE YOUR BOTTLES AFTER 6 MONTHS
AND THIS IS WHERE JOE BARNES CAME IN
I CAN GUARANTEE YOU WHATEVER TROUBLE YOU WENT TO IS PEANUTS COMPARED TO
WATER IS QUITE DENSE
I'M TRYING TO SAY
ONE LITER WEIGHS ONE KILOGRAM SO A 20 LITER JERRY CAN WILL WEIGH
WE JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS AFTER 6 MONTHS
BUT WE WENT BACK AFTERWARDS TO SEE WHETHER THERE HAD BEEN ANY PROTECTIVE EFFECT
BUT NOT FOR THE PEOPLE AFFECTED OBVIOUSLY
WELL WE HAVE CANCELED THE SEA RESCUE MISSIONS TO HELP THESE PEOPLE
SO WE ARE TRYING TO SAY WELL IF HE WOULD NOT BE DEPORTED NOW THEN SURELY HE SHOULD BE READMITTED
WAS IT BECAUSE IT WAS ON PRINCIPLE
AND OF COURSE THAT CAUSES PEOPLE TO FLEE
IT HAS BEEN JUST OVER A YEAR NOW
THEY'RE STUCK IN A KAFKAESQUE BUREAUCRACY
GERMANY IS OFFERING 30000 PLACES ON A VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD AND SIMPLE RESETTLEMENT SCHEME
I SAY A LOT
UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE POLITICIANS DID FINALLY AGREE TO A RESETTLEMENT SCHEME AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THEN
1 MILLION IN LEBANON
THEN LAST MONTH TO TOP IT ALL WE HAVE STOPPED SYRIANS WHO HAVE GOT US VISAS WHO ARE TRAVELING TO THE US
ONCE SHE WAS THERE SHE WAS TO SPEND TWO YEARS IN DETENTION AND SHE HAS ONLY JUST BEEN RELEASED
OF COURSE PEOPLE WANT TO REACH SAFETY AND SECURITY AND SOME OF THEM ARE WILLING TO PUT THEIR LIVES AT RISK
HE HAS BEEN AWAY FROM HIS FAMILY NOW FOR SEVERAL YEARS THEY HAVE HAD SOME REALLY HARD TIMES THIS FAMILY THEY HAVE HAD
IT IS SHAMING FRANKLY
THERE IS ALSO NO PROSPECTS OF HER BEING REMOVED AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL
WE DO NOT READ A LOT ABOUT IT IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA FOR A WHILE IT WAS IN NEWSPAPERS A LOT NOT SO
IT IS HARD WORKING WITH FAMILIES WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN SPLIT BY THE IMMIGRATION RULES WHERE THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO LIVE
THE ESTIMATE FOR THIS YEAR IS THAT IT IS GOING TO BE HIGHER
THE MINIMUM THRESHOLD IS 12 MONTHS
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
143 HERE IN THE UK
I'M NOT ASKING 20 I'M NOT ASKING 15 I'M NOT EVEN ASKING 10
WHETHER OR NOT THEY'LL INVEST IN A COMPANY WHETHER OR NOT THEY WILL BACK
AMERICA'S BEEN WAITING FOR SOMEONE WHO CAN REALLY SHOW LEADERSHIP
AND PEOPLE WHO ARE EMOTIONAL ABOUT SOMETHING WILL THEREFORE GO OVER THE TOP
BALANCED MINDS BALANCED DIETS BALANCED LIVES
AND SO IT SHOULD BE OF INTENSE CONCERN TO US THAT THIS IS A PHRASE THAT IS BEING USED NOW BY THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA
IN MY TIME WORKING IN GOVERNMENT WE HAD TONY BLAIR AND GORDON BROWN DESCRIBED AS TWO
WELL THREE IS THE MAGIC NUMBER IN RHETORIC
BORIS JOHNSON BACK IN THE UK HE'S TALKED ABOUT HOW THE LABOR LEADER EMANATED
IT SWEEPS PEOPLE ONTO THE NEXT POINT WHICH IS FREE BALANCE IN STATEMENTS
IF YOU GOOGLE CALAIS AND CROISSANT YOU GET JUST HALF A MILLION RESULTS
AND THEY'RE ALL LIES AND THEY ARE NEVER CHALLENGED
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU KNOW THIS BUT THERE IS A SECRET LANGUAGE OF LEADERSHIP A SECRET
AND WHAT'S THE IMAGE THIS IS PLANTING IN YOUR MIND
IT'S A BIG LIE
HE HAS A DIFFERENT METAPHOR
BUT IT'S COMPLETE NONSENSE
AND SO I'M GONG TO DEMONSTRATE THIS NOW
AND YET IT'S A BIG LIE ISN'T IT
METAPHOR IS PROBABLY THE MOST POWERFUL PIECE OF POLITICAL COMMUNICATION
BUT IT'S THE BIT NO ONE EVER TALKS ABOUT THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM SO TO SPEAK WHICH IS EXTRAORDINARY
AND SO HE DOESN'T SPEAK USING THE FINANCIAL STORM METAPHOR
THIS MANIFESTS IN OUR SPEECH
OF COURSE HE COULD HAVE SAID THIS A WHOLE LOT QUICKER
SO WHAT I'M GONNA DO IN MY SPEECH IS REVIVE THIS ANCIENT ART OF RHETORIC AND SHARE WITH YOU SIX
I'D LIKE ONE OF YOU TO THROW ME AN ISSUE
YESTERDAY I WAS IN LONDON AND I WAS WATCHING ONE OF MY CLIENTS WHO IS A BIG AUSTRALIAN BUSINESSMAN
LET'S MOVE ON TO NUMBER SIX RHYME
POPE FRANCIS KNOWS THAT IT'S A BIG LIE
I'LL DO IT EVEN SLOWER
ASK HIM TO NAME OUT ONE SUIT
I CAN MAKE THIS 20 BUCKS CHANGE INTO WHATEVER YOU WANT
AND ON THAT NOTE ENJOY THE REST OF THE TEDX AND HAVE A GREAT DAY
WE'LL GO FOR A HUNDRED BUCKS
THE ONLY RULE IS THAT PERSON CAN'T BE IN THE ROOM WITH US RIGHT NOW
SHOUT OUT MAKE SOME NOISE
I'M GOING TO NEED TO BORROW SOMETHING ACTUALLY FROM THE AUDIENCE
THEY TEND TO WANT TO SWEEP IT UNDER THE CARPET TO PRETEND IT DOESN'T EXIST
WELL CORPORATE PSYCHOPATHS ARE THOSE PSYCHOPATHS WHO ARE ABOUT 1 OF THE
SO THEY'RE DOING IT QUITE OFTEN TO CREATE CONFUSION AND CHAOS ALL AROUND THEM
SO IT ALL GETS SWEPT UNDER THE CARPET
AND WHEN PEOPLE SAY THINGS LIKE THAT TO YOU THAT'S WHAT YOU EXPECT
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THEY DO IT
THEN YOU THINK THAT THESE PEOPLE MUST HAVE BEEN WRONG
SO THEY DO IT BECAUSE THEY LIKE IT
AND QUITE OFTEN THEY'LL DO THINGS LIKE THEY'LL PAY OFF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING BULLIED
AND SO THEY GO INTO THE CORPORATE WORLD
SO YOU'LL STOP WORKING PROPERLY YOU'LL SABOTAGE NORMAL WORK PROCESSES YOU'LL
SO THE SAME WORDS ARE USED TO DESCRIBE THEM THESE PSYCHOPATHS AS I USED TO DESCRIBE
THEY CAN BE TOTALLY RUTHLESS AND SLEEP PERFECTLY WELL THAT NIGHT BECAUSE NOTHING THEY DO
ONE OF THEM IS PREDATORY
AND THEREFORE THE ONLY PERSON THAT SEEMS LIKE THEY WANT
SO IF YOU LINK IT AT AN ORGANIZATIONAL LEVEL COMPANIES LIKE ENRON
AND VARIOUS PEOPLE CAME UP TO ME AND SAID YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT THIS NEW GUY THIS NEW BOSS YOU'RE GETTING
IT TENDS TO BE AGAINST THE COMPANY
AND WHEN I WAS MOVED OFFICES I WAS TOLD I WAS GETTING A NEW BOSS
PSYCHOPATHS BULLY FOR TWO MAIN REASONS
THE OTHER REASON THEY DO IT IS WHAT I'VE CALLED INSTRUMENTAL BULLYING
SO THAT MADE ME THINK BUT WHY
YOU EXPECT TO MEET A MONSTER
HE LOOKS LIKE YOUR NEXT BEST FRIEND
IT WAS 346 MANAGERS RESEARCH CARRIED OUT IN 2008
AND SO YOU GET CONFUSED
SO ANYBODY FOR EXAMPLE A BOSS LOOKING DOWN ON THIS WHOLE SITUATION OF BULLYING AND EMOTIONAL
AND IF THERE ARE PSYCHOPATHS THERE WILL BE BULLYING
I WANT YOU TO TAKE A LOOK CAREFULLY TO SEE IF YOU CAN NOTICE A DIFFERENCE
BUT THERE'S A SECOND KIND OF PROCRASTINATION THAT HAPPENS IN SITUATIONS WHEN THERE IS NO DEADLINE
THEY CAME AND WENT AND I COULDN'T QUITE DO STUFF
AND THEY SAY IS THIS TIM URBAN
AND I SAY YEAH
I COULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT 15 OR 20 YEARS AGO IN QUITE THE SAME WAY
AT DAIMLER THE GERMAN CAR COMPANY THEY'VE GOT ANOTHER GREAT STRATEGY
ONE THING YOU CAN DO IS ASK YOURSELF WHAT GOES ON DURING THAT TIME
AND THIS WAS HIS WAY OF CONVINCING THEM THAT IF IT WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR HIM IT WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR THEIR PETS
SO THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD THAT COMES FROM THEM
THERE WERE STOPPING CUES EVERYWHERE
THE SAME WITH MAGAZINES BOOKS YOU GET TO THE END OF A CHAPTER PROMPTS YOU TO CONSIDER WHETHER YOU WANT TO CONTINUE
YOU REALLY CONNECT WITH THE PEOPLE WHO ARE THERE WITH YOU
STOPPING CUES WERE EVERYWHERE IN THE 20TH CENTURY
AND THINK ABOUT NEWSPAPERS EVENTUALLY YOU GET TO THE END YOU FOLD THE NEWSPAPER AWAY YOU PUT IT ASIDE
NOW OF COURSE SCREENS ARE MIRACULOUS IN A LOT OF WAYS
BECAUSE WE'RE REALLY BAD AT RESISTING TEMPTATION
AT THE END OF THE CALL THE JOURNALIST THREW IN A QUESTION THAT SEEMED LIKE A SORT OF SOFTBALL
WE GET SOME OF THAT FROM WORK AS WELL BUT WHEN PEOPLE LOOK BACK ON THEIR LIVES AND WONDER WHAT THEIR LIVES HAVE BEEN LIKE AT THE
WHICH LEADS ME TO THE SECOND COMPONENT
WHAT DO YOU WANT
WOMEN THAT WE SEE IN ADS ARE OFTEN NOT REAL
BRANDS ARE NOT SAYING HEY YOU WOMAN I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
THEY DON'T WANT TO BE OBJECTIFIED ANYMORE THEY WANT RESPECT FOR THEIR BODIES AND IDENTITIES
I WANT TO PLEASE YOU
THEY ALSO WANT TO BE THE PROTAGONISTS OF THEIR OWN STORIES
THEY WANT BRANDS THAT COMMUNICATE STRAIGHT TO THEM HEY WHAT DO YOU WANT
AND I'M NOT ONLY SAYING ABOUT PHOTOSHOP
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT AFTER SEEING SOME NUMBERS IN BRAZIL SAYING THAT 65 PERCENT OF WOMEN DON'T FEEL
SO IT ALL STARTS WITH
AND WHEN THEY ARRIVED THERE WAS TREMENDOUS INTEREST IN TRANSLATING THIS WISDOM INTO A EUROPEAN LANGUAGE
OTHERS SAY THAT GRANTING EQUALITY TO THE PALESTINIANS AND ALLOWING THE REFUGEES A RIGHT OF
I'VE LOOKED UP THE TERM SELF DETERMINATION AND AS FAR AS I CAN TELL
WHAT I SAY IS THIS
THEY MAY NOT GET THROUGH IT
I MEAN JUST THINK HOW LONG IT TAKES A CHILD TO LEARN TO SPEAK
ML IT'S MUCH BETTER THAN THAT
WE HAVE LOCAL NUMBERS ACCESSIBLE TO THREE QUARTERS OF A BILLION PEOPLE ON THE PLANET
NO EXPENSIVE STAFF TIME REQUIRED
AND LIKE BALLET IT TAKES AN EXTRAORDINARY LEVEL OF TRAINING
AND THAT'S WHAT WE DO TO ALL TRAFFIC SURVIVORS
AND THEIR MISSION WAS TO MAKE JAMILA'S COMPANY THE MOST INVESTABLE COMPANY IT COULD BE BY THE END OF THAT
THAT WOULD DOUBLE MY INCOME
THAT WOULD PROVIDE A STEADY STREAM OF INCOME
I DON'T EVEN KNOW I CAN REALLY TEACH THIS CLASS
BECAUSE OF THAT IT TAKES A LONG TIME
NOT ONLY DID THEY DO IT ONE TIME EVERY ONE OF THE ENTREPRENEURS HAD 4 SESSIONS LIKE THIS
BUT YOU KNOW ACTUALLY THERE IS A PROBLEM
AND HE SAID THAT'S AMAZING
NOW WE NEED TO FIND A MECHANIC SO THEY CALLED THEIR 1ST AWAY TEAM AND FOUND A MECHANIC IN TOWN
I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF EXTRA CARS AND MOTORCYCLES FOR THEM TO WORK ON
NOT IN AN ARBITRARY WAY IN A WAY THAT BECAME SO REAL THAT AT THE END OF 3 HOURS WE
WHAT IT MEANS TO TRULY CREATE VALUE BY PEOPLE INTERACTING WITH EACH OTHER
AND IT WOULD BE MORE STABLE FOR ME
SO THEY FOUND SOME BOYS HANGING OUT ON THE STREET TALKED WITH THEM
AND THEY WERE KIND OF INTERESTED IN CARPENTRY THEY MIGHT PAY 10 PESOS FOR A LESSON IN CARPENTRY BUT
WHAT IT MEANS TO TRULY SERVE A COMMUNITY
IT USUALLY TAKES 3 4 OR 5 MONTHS
THAT'S WHY IT TAKES MONTHS TO DO ACTUALLY
BUT IF YOU WERE TO SIT DOWN AND START BUILDING THAT DAY NOT ONLY WOULD YOU START HAVING YOUR PLANS
SO IF YOU ASK A FRIEND FOR MAYBE 100 DOLLARS NOT A BIG DEAL
THEY WEREN'T SERIAL ENTREPRENEURS
EVERY YEAR NEW CAVES GET DISCOVERED THAT NO ONE HAS EVER BEEN IN BEFORE
AROUND THIS HALF OF THE COUNTRY MOST OF YOUR CAVES ARE MADE OF LIMESTONE
WELL NOT TOO MUCH LIVES IN THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE SO COLD AND THE ENTRANCE IS ACTUALLY COVERED UP WITH SNOW FOR ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS OF THE
NOW THESE DAYS WITH SO MANY PEOPLE HIKING AROUND IT'S PRETTY HARD TO FIND A NEW CAVE SO YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW EXCITED WE WERE TO
IF YOU SQUISH A HANDFUL OF SNOW TO MAKE A SNOWBALL IT GETS REALLY SMALL HARD AND DENSE
DIFFERENT WATERFALLS POP UP OR MOVE AROUND FROM PLACE TO PLACE INSIDE THE CAVE
THESE ARE THE ONES WHO FIT NEITHER THE POLICY STEREOTYPE OF THE LOW SKILLED AND THE MARGINALIZED
WHAT WE DISCOVERED OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS WAS NOBODY HAD DISTINGUISHED BETWEEN
SO WE ASKED OURSELVES
IT WASN'T JUST THAT WE WERE SWITCHING LEAD AND FOLLOW IT'S THAT WE STAYED CONSISTENT IN OUR PRESENCE OUR PERSONALITY AND OUR
NOW YOU JUST SAW TWO MAN DANCING TOGETHER
BUT KNOW THAT THIS IS HISTORY
WATCH WHAT'S NOT
THE SECRET LIES IN WHAT MADE LISA SEE OUR INITIAL DEMONSTRATION AS POLITICAL
ANYONE CAN LEAD
I MEAN ONE DAY WE WOULD SAY FOX TROT AND PEOPLE WERE LIKE FOXES TROTTING
WITH THIS SIMPLE TWEAK THE DANCE MOVES FROM BEING A DICTATION TO A NEGOTIATION
THIS DOESN'T REPRESENT HOW WE THINK TODAY
SO THAT BEGAN AN EIGHT YEAR COLLABORATION TO CREATE A PLAY WHICH NOT ONLY FURTHER DEVELOPED OUR SYSTEM FOR SWITCHING BUT ALSO
THIS ISN'T THE PRESENT
RESPECT IT REVIVE IT GREAT
WHAT ABOUT FUKUSHIMA
THOSE ARE REALLY REASONABLE QUESTIONS TO ASK
WHAT ABOUT THE WEAPONS
MOST OF THAT REDUCTION IS JUST DUE TO THAT
WHAT ABOUT ALL THE NUCLEAR WASTE
AND SO IT MAKES SENSE YOU'D THINK IF WE DO SOLAR WIND YOU CAN JUST GO A LOT FASTER
ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES TO THIS HAS COME FROM SOMEBODY HERE IN GERMANY WHO IS NOT A PRO NUCLEAR PERSON AT
THIS IS CHERNOBYL
HERE'S THIS REALLY BASIC SCIENCE IT IS RIGHT THERE ON THE WEBSITE
IF I THOUGHT THERE WAS ANY CHANCE MORE NUCLEAR POWER WOULD INCREASE THE CHANCE OF NUCLEAR WAR I'D BE AGAINST IT
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SHELTER IN PLACE
SO IF WE JUST DO MORE SOLAR AND WIND WON'T IT KIND OF ALL WORK ITSELF OUT
SO THAT'S KIND OF THE FIRST THING
BECAUSE NATURAL GAS IS ABOUT HALF OF THE CARBON INTENSITY OF COAL AND THAT WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT
AND WHILE WE WERE STRUGGLING WITH THIS PROBLEM AROUND 2005 STEWART BRAND CAME OUT AND HE
THAT'S EVEN BEFORE YOU GET TO THE QUESTION OF STORAGE
SO THE OBVIOUS RESPONSE IS WE'LL JUST PUT IT ALL IN BATTERIES
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A PACIFIST
IT WAS ADVERTISEMENT
WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A COUPLE OF DECADES NOW
WE'VE MADE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS IN SEAWATER DESALINATION IN THE PAST TWO DECADES
BUT MY OWN EXPERIENCES WORKING WITH SOME OF THE WORLD'S MOST WATER STARVED CITIES IN THE LAST DECADES
AND THE PLACE WHERE WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT WATER CONSERVATION IS OUTDOORS BECAUSE IN CALIFORNIA AND OTHER
AND IN THE PROCESS OF PASSING THROUGH THE WETLAND AND PERCOLATING THROUGH THE GROUND THE WATER ENCOUNTERS
OUR GRANDPARENTS' GENERATION CREATED AN AMAZING SYSTEM OF CANALS AND RESERVOIRS THAT MADE IT
FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO LIVE IN ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREAT CITIES WE'VE NEVER TRULY
AND THAT'S BECAUSE WHEN THINGS HAVE GOTTEN BAD IN THE PAST IT'S ALWAYS BEEN POSSIBLE TO EXPAND A RESERVOIR
IT'S AS IF THEY'RE ALL IN ONE BIG TRIBE
WE WERE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE THREAT AGAINST US
THESE PEOPLE ARE IN DANGER
THE SUICIDE RATE WENT DOWN
IT'S JUST GETTING WORSE
RACE RELATIONS ARE TERRIBLE
EVERYONE'S BEEN IN IT OR IS GOING TO BE IN IT
THE LIGHTS WERE TOO BRIGHT
I KEPT HAVING PANIC ATTACKS BUT THEY EVENTUALLY WENT AWAY
BUT I DIDN'T REALLY THINK IT AFFECTED ME
I DO BELIEVE THE SOUND ON THIS INSTRUMENT IS MUCH MORE INTERESTING THAN THE SOUND OF MY OWN VOICE
SO THE QUESTION IS
WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE FAT KID TO KEEP HIM FROM WATCHING KNIGHT RIDER RERUNS ALL DAY
THE BASS ISN'T NARROW ENOUGH
AND ALL OF US WILL BENEFIT
SOME OF THE WORST ISSUES OF OUR TIME ARE CONNECTED TO IT
AND FRESH WATER PLANET EARTH HAS A VERY LIMITED SUPPLY
AND THEN WHEN I BUILD ON TOP OF THAT I'M ABLE TO DO THAT MUCH MORE
I KEPT GOING WITH THEM SO I SAW HOW I REACT IN THE WORLD
AND WE RAN REALLY WELL FOR THE NEXT 10 MILES AND THEN THE REALITY OF WHAT I'D DONE TO MYSELF SET IN
AND WHEN WE HIT THE BOTTOM OF THE TRAIL AND THE TRAIL OPENED UP TO THE ROAD AND I COULD SEE THE SHOPS OF CHAMONIX
AND THOSE LAST 10 MILES I'D TOLD HER BEFORE DON'T LISTEN TO ME ANYTHING YOU I TELL YOU YOU TELL ME TO RUN
I'M AN ULTRA DISTANCE TRAIL RUNNER
AND THAT UNKNOWN IS PRETTY AMAZING
THE CONGOLESE WAR LORDS WERE SELLING THIS STUFF TO THE MAFIA IN EXCHANGE FOR WEAPONS AND THE MAFIA WOULD
THEY AFFECT OUR COMMUNICATIONS OUR PENSION FUNDS
THIS BOAT IS WORTH ONE MILLION EUROS WHEN IT'S NEW
WHEN THAT HAPPENS IT IS A TREND WHICH IS SET TO OVERWHELM OUR POLICING CAPACITY IN THE WEST
NOW COLTAN YOU WILL FIND IN ALMOST EVERY MOBILE PHONE IN ALMOST EVERY LAPTOP AND
THE COURT SYSTEM WASN'T FUNCTIONING PROPERLY
SO WHAT WAS A BUSINESS MAN IN THE BRAVE NEW WORLD OF EAST EUROPEAN
I LIKE TO CALL IT THE GLOBAL SHADOW ECONOMY OR MCMAFIA FOR SHORT
CREATING ARTIFACTS FOR EACH OTHER TO HELP EACH OTHER LEARN
I CAN'T SIT STILL FOR SIX HOURS AND DO ANY ONE THING ANYMORE
YOU SEE ELEMENTS OF PERSONALITY
THERE ARE ELEMENTS OF LEARNING THAT WE LOSE ALONG THE WAY
ULTIMATELY IF WE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO ACHIEVE THEIR OWN VALUE TO GET REFERENDUMS THROUGH
THIS IS NOT AN EDUCATIONAL QUESTION
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SOCIAL LEARNING NOW
AND I WONDER IF WE CAN MAP REASONABLY A POPULATION'S EFFORTS AT THE THOUGHT
WE ARE ALSO FINDING THAT LEARNING MAY ACTUALLY BE A CAUSE TO CURE DEPRESSION
I DON'T JUST MEAN WHAT CODE WE'RE USING TO WRITE TO
WE REMEMBER THINGS BETTER WHEN THEY'RE ATTACHED TO A PICTURE
YOU JUST HAVE TO ASK IT TO PUT THE PIECES TOGETHER FOR YOU
AND IT WAS PROBABLY THE MOST UNHAPPY YEAR OF MY LIFE
YOU CHANGE ITS ENVIRONMENT AND THE OBJECT WILL FLOW
IT UPLOADS A PICTURE AND THE REASON WHY IT CHOSE THAT CAKE FOR YOU TO OUR FACEBOOK PAGE
I DIDN'T WANT IT TO HAPPEN BUT IT DID
IT HAD BEEN THERE EVERY DAY BUT I MISSED IT EVERY DAY UNTIL NOW
HALF THE TEAM SHOWED
HE WAS THOUGHTFUL
BUT YOU'RE ALSO BRIGHT AND YOU KNOW NOT EVERYONE DOES
HE SAID WHEN I REALIZED THAT AND A NEW LENS CLICKED IN PLACE I SAW SOMETHING RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF ME
I BROKE THROUGH
AND THAT'S WHERE THE TRAGEDY STARTS
THE SAME HALF A TEAM SHOWED UP ALMOST TO A PERSON AND THE SAME GUY GAVE DAVE THE SAME
AND HE SAID
I LEARNED TO GET OVER MYSELF
I HOPE THAT'S THE PERSPECTIVE YOU'LL TAKE WITH YOU TODAY CAUSE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE AN AMAZING ARRAY OF
ENJOY THIS EVENT
AND THERE ARE MANY WEBSITES MARKETING SUCH DUBIOUS PRODUCTS
I SAW BEYOND THE GENES AND THE CHROMOSOMES INTO THE LIVES OF THE REAL PEOPLE WE WERE
OUR TELOMERES ARE LOSING THE WAR OF ATTRITION FASTER
ROADS AND RICE
I WAS INVITED TO ADDRESS THE UNITED NATIONS ON WORLD FOOD DAY
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT
I DON'T WANT TO STUDY LABOR RELATIONS
AND THERE WERE STILL 25 THOUSAND KHMER ROUGE ALL OVER THE COUNTRYSIDE
ROADS AND WHEAT
THE SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE UNITED NATIONS CAME TO DES MOINES TO HELP PRESENT OUR
WHERE THE ROAD ENDS THE INSURGENCY BEGINS
SO WE HAD THIS BOND THAT KEPT US TOGETHER
THEY WANTED TO KNOW HOW THEY COULD BUY A COPY OF THAT STATUE OF BORLAUG AND PUT IT UP ON THEIR CAMPUS
I DON'T WANT TO GO TO WESTERN EUROPE
I'M TELLING THEM THESE STORIES AND I SAID LOOK AFRICA AND SOUTH ASIA ARE GOING TO BE FACING
THAT'S WHAT ALLOWED MY MIRACLE WHEAT TO GET OUT TO PEOPLE
THAT'S WHAT TRANSFORMS RURAL AREAS
BECAUSE IN THE 1860S IT WAS UNDERSTOOD HOW THE TWO WENT TOGETHER AND WHAT IMPACT THEY
30 YEARS FROM NOW
I HAD TO GO TO VIETNAM TO LEARN IT BUT I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN IT AND ALL OF YOU SHOULD KNOW IT BECAUSE IT IS THE
I WANT TO STAY IN VIETNAM
WE ARE GOING ON
IT' S GOOD FOR EVERYBODY
SO WE CANNOT STAY HERE IT'S DANGEROUS
I THOUGHT HOW MUCH MONEY DO I HAVE IN MY POCKET
BUT ALSO FOR THE NEWCOMERS
YOU AND I CAN GO ON AND BUY IT FOR THEM
OF COURSE THESE ARE UNDERGRADUATES IN CANADA NOT THE WORLD'S MOST REPRESENTATIVE POPULATION
MAYBE YOU HAVE SOMETHING IN MIND MAYBE NOT
WE CAN LOOK AND SEE HOW WELL THEY SELL THINGS AS A FUNCTION OF BEING A MEMBER OF A TEAM
AND INSTEAD OF TALKING ABOUT HOW IT MADE THEM REALIZE THAT MONEY DOESN'T LEAD TO HAPPINESS EVERYONE STARTED SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT I'D DO IF I WON
PEOPLE WHO SPENT MONEY ON OTHERS GOT HAPPIER PEOPLE WHO SPENT IT ON THEMSELVES NOTHING HAPPENED
NOW I WILL SPECULATE
TALKING BAD ABOUT AL SHARPTON AND BLACK LIVES MATTER
THE WATER IS GREAT
BUT IT IS THE WAY THAT I ARTICULATED RACE THAT MADE ME SOMEWHAT OF A DIGITAL LIGHTENING ROD
THEN WITH MY CELL PHONE I FLIPPED THE INTERNET AGAINST ITSELF AND BEGAN TO BROADCAST
WHERE ARE THESE GUYS GETTING THEIR ARGUMENTS FROM
A LOT OF THESE GUYS WERE JUST REGULAR JOES
INTO CONTROVERSIAL TALKING POINTS
JOIN THE PARTY
MIND YOU NOT ENOUGH COMPASSION LIKE I WANT TO BE FRIENDS
IT IS TIME WE START SEEING PEOPLE AS PEOPLE AND NOT SIMPLY THE IDEAS WE PROJECT ONTO THEM OR REACT
THIS MADE THEM WANT TO LEAVE THE SAFETY OF THEIR LAPTOPS AND MEET US IN PERSON TO HAVE REAL CONVERSATIONS WITH REAL
THAT'S A DANGEROUS IMBALANCE
AND THAT IS A FERTILE GROUND FOR ALT FACTS TO GROW
AND SO WAS I
MY TIMELINE WAS PRETTY LIBERAL
SO I SOON BECAME FAMILIAR WITH THE PHENOMENON OF AN INTERNET TROLL
I ADMIT THIS RACE STUFF CAN BE KIND OF DIVISIVE
ALTHOUGH THE SUPPOSED MORONS ENGAGED IN WHAT APPEARED TO BE ORIGINAL THOUGHT
AND WE DID THIS
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO PASSIVELY ACCEPT WHAT SOCIETY TELLS US TO THINK IS BEAUTIFUL
NOT EVEN BEYONC MADE THE CUT TO BE AN A GIRL
SO I FELT BETRAYED
I COME ACROSS THE CASTING CALL
WHY BOTHER TELL ME
THE LOVE AND ACCEPTANCE THAT I WOULD GET BEING ON A STAGE WERE REAL
I HAVE MADE MY CLOSET MY ALLY
A WORLD WHERE I DON'T NEED A COSTUME IN ORDER TO FIT IN
RADICAL AMOUNTS OF AUTONOMY
THAT'S NOT HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO WORK RIGHT
IT'S BUILT MUCH MORE AROUND INTRINSIC MOTIVATION
WORK ON ANYTHING YOU WANT
IT SUCKS BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS
THEY JUST WORK
NOT ALL OF YOU HOWEVER
PASSING AS A NATURAL WOMAN CAN DECIDE WHETHER I HAVE A GOOD DAY OR A BAD DAY
THIRTY FIVE YEARS AFTER THE PUBLICATION OF THE TRANSSEXUAL EMPIRE
THINGS MEN IN THIS COUNTRY AREN'T REALLY ALLOWED TO DO
MEN WHO JUDGE US TO BE NOT FEMME ENOUGH
I WORE DRESSES TO MORNING CLASSES
THEY JUST ARE
AND IF I DON'T LOOK RICH BEAUTIFUL AND AMERICAN AM I STILL A WOMAN
I STOPPED CUTTING MY HAIR
MOST OF YOU AGREED WITH ME
THE THESIS OF THIS TEXT IS ESSENTIALLY THAT
AND IS IT BAD IF WE WANT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT MAKE A COUPLE OF CHANGES
BECAUSE MEN ARE SCARY PIGS AND PATRIARCHY IS REAL
BUT I WILL ASK GOD FOR FORGIVENESS
I HADN'T DONE ANYTHING WRONG
THEY'VE HAD THREE OTHER CHILDREN
I WASN'T CHARGED FOR ANYTHING
I DON'T MEAN CHILDREN
I HAVE TO TELL IT BECAUSE THERE WAS NO ONE TO PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER
I TRIED PRAYING
SO THIS WAS AN OPPORTUNITY
IT'S OUR RESPECT
THE MOTHER AND BABY'S HOMES WERE OFTEN RUN BY NUNS
I WAS STARTING TO STAY OUT A LITTLE BIT LATE ETC
WE NEED TO HAVE ALL OF THE DATA ON A PARTICULAR TREATMENT TO KNOW WHETHER OR NOT IT REALLY IS EFFECTIVE
THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT IS CURRENTLY LACKING A SOLUTION
I READ THE TRIALS ON THIS
AGAIN NOT AN INSANE DOSE NOT AN ILLEGAL DOSE BUT VERY MUCH AT THE HIGH END OF NORMAL
AND YOU CAN GET LICENSED TO BRING YOUR DRUG TO MARKET WITH ONLY DATA SHOWING THAT IT'S BETTER THAN NOTHING WHICH IS USELESS FOR A DOCTOR
WE STOCKPILE THEM FOR EMERGENCIES ON THE UNDERSTANDING THEY'LL REDUCE THE NUMBER OF COMPLICATIONS WHICH MEANS PNEUMONIA AND DEATH
SO DID THE EUROPEAN MEDICINES AGENCY FOR THREE YEARS
AND THEY NEED TO HAVE ACCESS TO ALL OF THE TRIAL DATA
THE INFECTIOUS DISEASES COCHRANE GROUP WHICH ARE BASED IN ITALY HAS BEEN TRYING TO GET THE FULL DATA IN A USABLE
BUT I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT GOVERNMENTS DON'T CARE
THE COCHRANE GROUPS ARE AN INTERNATIONAL NONPROFIT COLLABORATION THAT PRODUCE SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS OF ALL OF THE DATA THAT
IT'S AT THE TOP OF THE PYRAMID OF EVIDENCE
THAT'S AN OUTRAGEOUS AND RIDICULOUS FINDING BUT IT'S TRUE
SO PEOPLE SET ABOUT DOING TRIALS OF THE NEW DRUGS AGAINST THE OLD DRUGS
I PHOTOGRAPHED THAT ENTIRE EXPERIENCE AT FIVE MINUTE INTERVALS
BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT REAL LIFE IT'S NOT LIKE THAT AT ALL
SO EVERY FIVE MINUTES I TOOK A PHOTOGRAPH
AND THIS IS WHAT SHE SAID
AND RECENTLY I'VE BECOME INTERESTED IN DIVING MUCH MORE DEEPLY INTO A SINGLE STORY
SO I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT EACH OF THOSE TODAY
SO BHUTAN HAS THIS REALLY WACKY THING WHERE THEY BASE MOST OF THEIR HIGH LEVEL
THE SECOND CONCEPT WAS TO USE THIS EXPERIENCE TO THINK ABOUT THE FUNDAMENTAL COMPONENTS OF ANY STORY
BUT YOU KNOW EVEN HOLDING ONE BALLOON IS LIKE KIND OF HAPPY
AND UP THERE THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PRAYER FLAGS THAT PEOPLE HAVE SPREAD OUT OVER THE YEARS
I MEAN IN REAL LIFE THINGS ARE MUCH MORE NUANCED AND COMPLEX AND THERE'S ALL OF THESE OVERLAPPING STORIES INTERSECTING AND TOUCHING EACH
WHEN I WAS AWAKE WITH THE CAMERA AROUND MY NECK
THAT WAS THE FIRST CONCEPT HERE
AND THAT'S LED ME TO DOING SOME WORK WITH THE PHYSICAL WORLD NOT WITH THE INTERNET AND ONLY USING THE INTERNET AT THE VERY LAST MOMENT AS
IT'S CALLED WE FEEL FINE
AND WHEN IT FINDS ONE OF THOSE PHRASES IT GRABS THE FULL SENTENCE UP TO THE PERIOD AND ALSO TRIES TO IDENTIFY DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION
SO REALLY EVEN CHALLENGING THE NOTION OF WHAT CAN BE CONSIDERED A STORY
AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY STILL FLYING UP THERE TODAY
FROM ALL THE INFORMATION THAT I GATHERED I ORGANIZED MY FIRST HACKATHON IN 2013 THEMED OPEN YORK DATA
WE ACTUALLY HAVE AN UNDERGROUND PATHWAY THAT I CONSIDER A MAZE I HAVE NEVER BEEN DOWN THERE
THERE WERE STILL JUDGES AND MENTORS TO HELP THEM CRITICALLY EVALUATE THEIR OUTCOMES
AND YES JOIN A HACKATHON
SO TRYING TO PAVE MY WAY AWAY FROM MYSELF AS A LIBRARIAN TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO OUTREACH TO STUDENTS AND TO
AND THEY WERE STARTING TO GET HACKATHON MANIA
THE PERSON WHO CAME UP WITH THIS APP TIMEIFY FELT THAT THE AD WAS EXCLUSIVE IT WAS ONLY MEANT FOR THOSE CERTAIN
THEY WERE TRYING TO BUILD AN APP TO HELP STUDENTS FIND THEIR WAY AROUND CAMPUS
THEY HAD TO THINK OF CONCEPTS AND IDEAS THEY HAD TO THINK OF DESIGN ISSUES AND THEY ALSO HAD TO THINK OF BUSINESS ASPECTS
HE WANTED TO CHANGE THAT
SO THAT WAY PEOPLE LIKE YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS TO READ A RESEARCH ARTICLE
AND THERE WERE ACTUALLY VENTURE CAPITALISTS TO HELP TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY PROJECTS TO
SO AT CENTENNIAL COLLEGE WHERE I CURRENTLY WORK I WORKED WITH THE APPLIED RESEARCH AND INNOVATION CENTER TO ORGANIZE A
I ALSO TALKED TO MY COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN TO HACKATHONS
SO WHAT OR WHO IS A HACKER
WHAT IT SHOWS YOU IS THAT ANYBODY CAN BE A HACKER
A HACKER IS SOMEBODY WHO SEES A PROBLEM WHO HAS AN OBSTACLE THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO OVERCOME WHO LIKES TO TAKE
MY PARENTS RISKED THEIR LIVES TO COME TO THIS COUNTRY IN HOPES OF A BETTER ONE NOT KNOWING WHETHER OR NOT
AND R AMP B ENTERPRISES WAS VERY PROFITABLE AT THE TIME SO THE SON REFUSED
BUT MY DAD APOLOGIZED EXPLAINED THE SITUATION AND STRATEGIZED THE BEST PLAN TO START PRODUCTION
MY DAD WAS WORKING 20 HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK AND MY MOM WAS WORKING FULL TIME
FOR EXAMPLE IT BECOMES POSSIBLE TO SIMULATE A PROCEDURE BEFORE ACTUAL
SO WE'RE GOING TO WRITE THIS UP AND TRY TO SUBMIT THIS FOR PUBLICATION
AND NOW WE WANT TO SHARE
AND THE DISCUSSION IS WHO CARES
THAT'S THE NEXT STEP
SO HOW CAN WE EVER DO ANYTHING NEW
WHAT'S THE POINT
THAT'S WHAT SCIENCE OFFERS US
THIS TELLS THEM THE DIRECTION THE BALL'S GOING TO GO
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE SAME
BUT WE DON'T WANT TO STOP THERE
I TURNED BACK TO THE GRANDMOTHER I'M SORRY WABI SABI IS THAT LIKE A DESK
THE WOMAN WITH THE PHOTOS ABOVE HER HEAD AND ME THE ONLY WESTERNER
WITHIN A FEW MOMENTS I HEARD SHOUTING
EVERYONE YOUNG AND OLD ALIKE BOWED BACK
THEY HAVE THIS FABULOUS TRADITION IN JAPAN
THE GRANDMOTHER SAID THAT BEAUTY IS A STUDY IN CONTRASTS SO SOMETHING CAN ONLY BE SEEN TO
I SLAMMED MY BOOK TOGETHER STARTED THROWING MY STUFF IN MY BAG
EVERY EYE IN THE PLACE WAS UPON US
FROM THE OTHER ROOM MYOKO CHIMED IN AGAIN
SHE STOPPED CRYING SHE STOPPED SCREAMING SHE BECAME SILENT
KILL HER PARENTS THIS WOMAN IS CRAZY THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT
I LOOKED UP AND SAW DISHEVELED LOOKING WOMAN WHO APPEARED TO BE SHOUTING AT ME
I AM NOT I AM NOT THE PRESIDENT I AM A TEENAGER
IT WAS CARVED OUT OF ONE SOLID PIECE OF WOOD
HE ASKED ME IF I WAS A MODEL
THE PROFESSION SUITED ME REALLY WELL
WHEREVER I WOULD GO THEY WOULD WITHIN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME WANNA SEND ME SOMEPLACE ELSE
I THINK THEY HAVE THE WHEREWITHAL TO DO IT
I DIDN'T KNOW IF I WAS GOING TO MAKE IT THIS WAS ONLY 12
SO DON'T EVER GIVE UP ON YOURSELF
I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO HELP SOLVE PROBLEMS
IT DOES HAPPEN IT IS A WORRY
MAYBE IT WAS CONTAMINATION
THEY GO AFTER THE GUY THEY FIND HIM THE GUY WITH THE GUN CAN'T POSSIBLY BE THE GUY WHO COMMITTED THESE RAPES
SO THEY LOOKED AT MORE LOCATIONS MORE POWERFUL STATISTICS
I THOUGHT OH MY GOSH THIS GUY IS GOING TO GET OFF
HE HAS NOT THE RIGHT AGE ETC
THAT MAN THE FIRST MAN IS OUT OF PRISON RIGHT NOW
KERRY ROBINSON IS IN PRISON
I SAID IT SEVERAL TIMES
WELL I CAN TELL YOU THAT TREATING PMS HAS BECOME A PROFITABLE THRIVING INDUSTRY
ONE STUDY FOLLOWED MEN AND WOMEN FOR FOUR TO SIX MONTHS AND FOUND THAT THE NUMBER OF MOOD
SO WE HAVE NOT HAD THAT AT ALL WITH THESE SO CALLED TREATMENTS
RESEARCH TELLS US THAT THE MORE A WOMAN BELIEVES THAT EVERYONE GETS PMS THE MORE LIKELY SHE
AND THEY ALSO LIST THE MEDICATIONS THAT PHYSICIANS HAVE PRESCRIBED TO TREAT IT LIKE ANTI DEPRESSANTS OR
THE MEDICAL FIELD HAS A LONG HISTORY OF CONCEPTUALIZING WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE PROCESSES AS
NOW FAR BE IT FROM ME TO ARGUE WITH THE MAGICAL POWERS OF CAFFEINE BUT I DON'T THINK REDUCING TENSION
IT'S OUT OF HER CONTROL
WHEN WOMEN ARE PRESCRIBED DRUGS LIKE ANTI DEPRESSANTS OR HORMONES MEDICAL PROTOCOL REQUIRES THAT
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES REAP UNTOLD PROFITS WHEN WOMEN ARE CONVINCED THEY SHOULD TAKE A PRESCRIBED
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I MEAN BY ERRONEOUSLY
HOWEVER AFTER FIVE DECADES OF RESEARCH THERE'S NO STRONG CONSENSUS ON THE
FOR MANY YEARS BECAUSE THERE WAS NO STANDARDIZATION IN THE DEFINITION OF PMS WHEN
WE NOW HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER OF SYMPTOMS AND A HIGH IMPACT ON FUNCTIONING THAT'S REQUIRED
IT'S THE BRINGER OF KNOWLEDGE TO ALL
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE ACTUAL WORDS THAT SOMEONE HAS WRITTEN IN AN EMAIL OR GIVEN ON A PHONE CALL
IS THERE SUCH A RIGHT
HE DIDN'T COME OVER LIKE A CRAZY MAN
OTHERWISE IF WE COULD MAKE IT SO THAT ALL THE BAD GUYS USED ONE CORNER OF THE INTERNET WE COULD HAVE A DOMAIN BADGUY
BUT IT'S BEEN ARGUED AND SOMEONE HERE IN THE AUDIENCE HAS TALKED TO A FORMER NSA ANALYST WHO
YOU HAD A FOLLOW ON A WEEK LATER TO A QATARI COMPANY
THE ALTERNATIVE TO THAT IS ONE THAT'S MUCH LESS EFFICIENT AND MUCH MORE INVASIVE OF PRIVACY WHICH IS GIGANTIC AMOUNTS
IS THERE ANYTHING TO THAT
DO YOU STILL THINK THAT
IT'S WHO THEY WROTE TO AND WHEN AND SO FORTH
THAT WOULD BE AWESOME AND WE COULD JUST CONCENTRATE ALL OUR EFFORTS THERE
SO I THINK ABSOLUTELY FOLKS DO HAVE A RIGHT TO PRIVACY AND THAT WE WORK VERY HARD TO MAKE SURE
I OFFERED HIM THE CHANCE TO SHARE AN IDEA WORTH SPREADING
AND I THINK THIS IS PARTLY WHERE THERE IS SUCH A DIVIDE OF OPINION THAT THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM AND AROUND THE WORLD WHO
IT'S CERTAINLY QUITE A STRONG STATEMENT THAT THE NSA IS WILLING TO REACH OUT AND SHOW A MORE OPEN
WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF IT
THE GOVERNMENT YOU OTHERS IN TERMS OF PUTTING THINGS RIGHT AND HELPING FIGURE OUT A SMARTER POLICY A SMARTER
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY RAPE IS NOT ONLY BETWEEN STRANGERS
RAISE YOUR HANDS
SHE HAS A DEADLINE TO MEET
HOW MANY PEOPLE IN HERE THINK THAT THEY HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT SEXUAL ASSAULT IS
WE CAN SAY THAT NO LONGER DOES OUR PAST DICTATE WHO WE ARE AS PEOPLE TODAY
A WOMAN IS WALKING DOWN A DARK DESERTED ALLEYWAY AT 2
IT'S TIME TO LET GO OF THAT PART OF US THAT LIKES TO SUFFER THAT LIKES TO BE A MARTYR IN A CRUEL AND
SHE NEEDS TO FINISH HER PAPER BEFORE MIDNIGHT
15 IN THE MORNING
SHE LEFT THE NIGHTCLUB EARLY AND SHE'S WALKING BY HERSELF WHEN OUT OF THE SHADOWS EMERGES A LARGE MALE FIGURE
SHE SAYS NO
HOW ARE WE GOING TO KEEP OURSELVES BUSY
MALA DID THAT TODAY WITH US
DO ROBOTS HAVE SOULS
MOORE'S LAW SAYS THAT EVERY SINGLE YEAR THE COMPUTERS ARE GOING TWICE AS FAST
ODD LITTLE FACT
BUT I'M HERE TO DISPEL MYTHS ABOUT BIRDING AND TO SHOW YOU HOW YOU TOO CAN JOIN IN
IF YOU WANT TO SEE A SNOWY OWL MY FAVORITE BIRD WHEN GROWING UP IF YOU WANT TO SEE A SNOWY OWL HEAD UP TO
ONE OF THE MOST COMMON BIRDS
I WOULD FIDDLE AROUND WITH MICROSCOPES AND ELECTROMAGNETS AND I WOULD READ ABOUT THE FORCES OF THE SMALL AND ABOUT QUANTUM
WE NEED MORE DATA
AND WE'LL NEED TO ENCOURAGE MORE PEOPLE TO JOIN US IN STUDYING SCIENCE SINCE WE NEED FRESH EYES ON THESE CENTURY OLD
THEY HAVE DIFFERENT RULES
ABSOLUTELY NOT WE WOULD BE TERRIBLE SCIENTISTS IF WE DID
WHAT IF THE ULTIMATE QUESTION
SO 2015 WAS GO TIME
BUT WHAT IF
AND THAT'S RARE
BUT THEN WHAT DO WE DO
I SEE THE LOOKS ON YOUR FACES
AND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PLAYING AROUND WITH EXTRA DIMENSIONS OF SPACE FOR A VERY LONG TIME BUT IT'S ALWAYS BEEN AN ABSTRACT MATHEMATICAL
DO WE JUST GIVE UP AND FLY AWAY
NO WE SPEND THE NEXT COUPLE OF DECADES EXPLORING MAPPING OUT THE TERRITORY SIFTING THROUGH THE
WE ALREADY USE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES IN PARTS OF THE LHC BUT IMAGINE DESIGNING A PARTICLE
THAT'S THE STAGE WE'RE AT NOW
BUT ONE OF THESE OPTIONS IS HUGE AND IT HAS TO DO WITH THAT LONG STANDING QUESTION THAT
BUT MATH IS MATH AND WE CAN PLAY AROUND WITH OUR MATH HOWEVER WE WANT
WE ONLY DECIDE TO KEEP EXPLORING
WHAT IF THE STUFF THAT'S BOTHERED ME SINCE I WAS A LITTLE KID IS DESTINED TO BE UNANSWERED IN MY LIFETIME
AS A KID I WOULD PUZZLE OVER QUESTIONS JUST LIKE THIS
IT ALL STARTED WHEN WE AT CERN SAW SOMETHING INTRIGUING IN OUR DATA
TO DISCOVER NEW PARTICLES WE NEED TO REACH THESE BIGGER NUMBERS
AND TO DO THAT WE HAVE TO BUILD A BIGGER HIGHER ENERGY COLLIDER AND THE BIGGEST HIGHEST ENERGY COLLIDER IN THE WORLD
WE DON'T DECIDE WHERE NATURE PLACES NEW PARTICLES
I LOVED LEARNING ABOUT THE BODY SYSTEMS AND HOW THEY WORKED
THIS RESEARCH TOPIC WAS CONCERNED WITH DESIGNING NEW DRUGS FOR CANCER TREATMENT
I STILL DIDN'T KNOW
AS SOON AS TWO MONTHS LATER I WAS BEING FLOWN TO CALIFORNIA TO WORK IN GREG'S LAB
AND THAT I WAS RECEIVING AN AWARD FOR CHEMISTRY OF ALL THINGS
SO INSTEAD I WAS USING A PILOT PROTEIN CALLED LYSOZYME
I NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND CHEMISTRY TO UNDERSTAND A FANTASTIC NEW MACHINE THAT MY SUPERVISOR A
BECAUSE I'D BROKEN THE MACHINE
I WAS CONVINCED THE ONLY REASON WE COULD BE SEEING THESE RESULTS WAS BECAUSE OF ME THE NOVICE
IT IS LIKE RETURNING TO FIND YOUR HOME BURGLED AND RANSACKED
SHE WAS OVERWHELMED WITH FATIGUE
HIS NAME WAS TED SORENSON
BUT SHE FOUND THROUGH WORD OF MOUTH THE EARTH CONSERVATION CORPS THIS FABULOUS NATIONAL SERVICE EXPERIENCE THAT PUT HER TO
OH YOU'VE DONE YOUR SERVICE THAT'S IT
BUSH AFTER 9 11
SORENSON I FIND MYSELF READING BOOKS ON THE CONSTITUTION AND THE LINCOLN DOUGLAS DEBATES NOT HOW TO
IT DOES TODAY AND WE HAVE MORE THAN 200 COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES THAT ARE CREATING SERVICE YEAR
IT WAS RONALD REAGAN THIS MAY SURPRISE YOU AS GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA WHO CREATED THE CALIFORNIA
IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT A COUNTRY IN WHICH A YOUNG PERSON HAS AN OPPORTUNITY
A BRILLIANT DIVERSITY SPREAD LIKE STARS LIKE A THOUSAND POINTS OF LIGHT
STUDIES SHOW ANXIETY AND UNHAPPINESS AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE IS ON THE RISE
IT WAS PRESIDENT BUSH 41 WHO SAID
AND I SAID MR
RUSHMORE FOR HIS AMAZING CONSERVATION SERVICE LEGACY WHO SAID THAT
HER LIFE PROSPECTS WERE REALLY DIM
AND BOTH PARTIES HAVE PRIORITIES
FROM ANACOSTIA A TEENAGE UNWED MOTHER WHO HAD DROPPED OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL
IN THE END SUCCESS OR FAILURE WILL DEPEND UPON HOW WE CONDUCT OURSELVES IN THE ORDINARY AFFAIRS OF
I THINK I GOT THEM ALL
IT WAS PRESIDENT GEORGE W
IT WAS RONALD REAGAN WHO WENT TO THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION AND SAID
THEY WOULD LEARN TO BELIEVE IN THINGS UNTIL THEY DIE TO DEVELOP IDEAS POWERFUL ENOUGH TO CHANGE THE
IN FACT IN NEW YORK CITY THERE WAS SUCH A RESPONSE OF COMPASSION AND LOVE FROM
AND IF YOU'RE A YOUNG PERSON WHO IS DISCONNECTED FROM SCHOOL OR WORK OR IS FORMERLY IN PRISON YOU CAN DO A
AND AS WE TRY TO BRING MONEYBALL TO GOVERNMENT AND MAKE THE EFFECTIVE CASE FOR NATIONAL SERVICE
PREVIOUSLY SOCIETY VIEWED ME AS SOME PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED
OR THEY COULD HANG UP MALARIA BED NETS IN AFRICA
CONSIDER THE STORY OF MY NOW DEAR FRIEND LASHANTAY MOORE
SO IT HAS A HUGE CIVIC EFFECT AND WHEN BOB PUTNAM TALKS ABOUT BOWLING ALONE WE CAN BOWL TOGETHER
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ALIKE HAVE ISSUED THE CALL TO SERVICE DOWN THE AGES AND IT HAS ELICITED SHEER
WE WILL RESTORE OUR COMMITMENT TO AMERICAN COMMUNITY IN OUR TIME AND MAKE AFFORDABLE THE
I FOUND MYSELF IN A CORPORATE LAW FIRM IN NEW YORK AND PARIS
WHERE YOU WILL GO WHAT YOU WILL DO
THEY OFTEN TALK ABOUT THE ADVENTURE
NATIONAL STUDIES SHOW THAT NATIONAL SERVICE REDUCES CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM AND BOOSTS MATH AND READING
PART OF YOU KNOWS THAT A YEAR OF NATIONAL SERVICE CAN PUT YOU ON A BETTER PATH
OUR EMAILS WERE LIGHTING UP WITH OFFERS FROM FRIENDS AND STRANGERS TO GIVE A HAND
HE WAS THE ONE WHO LED THE FLOOR DEBATE FOR THE PASSAGE OF WHAT HE THEN CALLED
NOW THEY SIT AND WAIT FOR THE PHONE TO RING
YET WE YOU LOOK INTO ORGANIZATIONS IN THE COMPANIES WHAT DO YOU FIND
HOW DO YOU MAKE A FAMILY OUT OF ALL THESE DIFFERENT PEOPLES
YOU FIND MANAGEMENT AGAINST EMPLOYEES GROUPS OF EMPLOYEES AGAINST OTHER GROUPS OF EMPLOYEES SALES AGAINST
THEY'VE GOT STUDIES IN TEAM DYNAMICS AND MORE LEADERSHIP WITH MORE TOOLS WITH WHICH WE CAN BUILD A STRONG AND
WHEN WILL THIS PERSON START TO FUNCTION
WHEN YOU SAY
I WANTED A RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM BUILT ON SAFETY
WATCHING MY BEAUTIFUL HAIR CIRCLE THE BATH TUBE DRAIN IN THE SHOWER BEFORE IT DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT WAS GUT
I STILL REMEMBER THAT FEELING OF ASTONISHMENT AND SURPRISE LIKE I HAVE BEEN TO INDIA FOR THE FIRST
WE WORRY ABOUT HOW YOU CAN GET AWAY FROM PEOPLE
A LOT OF CHANGE IS GRADUAL
YOU CAN SEE THE GREAT CHINESE FAMINE
WE WORRY ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE THERE ARE
HOW SHALL I BEST ORGANIZE SOCIETY WHEN THE NEED FOR HUMAN LABOR DIMINISHES
HOW MIGHT I USE COMPUTING TO HELP TAKE US TO THE STARS
WE TEACH THEM
HOW MIGHT I EXTEND AND ENHANCE HUMAN LIFE THROUGH COGNITIVE HEALTHCARE
AND THAT'S THE EXCITING THING
NOW THERE ARE A LOT OF PIECES OF DR
I DO NOT FEAR AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE HAND OF A LONE WOLF
I'M NOT BUILDING A HAL
CAN WE BUILD SYSTEMS THAT RECOGNIZE OBJECTS IDENTIFY EMOTIONS EMOTE THEMSELVES PLAY GAMES AND EVEN
WE DON'T PROGRAM THEM
TED IS FAMOUS FOR KEEPING A VERY SHARP EYE ON THE CLOCK SO THEY'RE GOING TO HATE
I'M NOT SLAGGING THEM OFF
IT'S IN EVERYTHING
I'M TALKING ABOUT AT HOME TOO
THIS IS WHAT DIDN'T WORK
DOCUMENT DOCUMENT DOCUMENT
AND THE MOST IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIP IS WITH OURSELVES LEARNING TO VALUE OURSELVES
THIS IS WHAT I TRIED TO DO
WHY DO PEOPLE STAY
I NEEDED THE MONEY
I WAS A SINGLE MOM
THAT WAS MY THING
WELL I KNEW IT WASN'T MY NAME
AND TAKE CARE OF THEIR FAMILIES
I AM THERESA HODGE
MY MOTHER MY FOUR SISTERS AND MY DAUGHTER AND I
IT'S A COMBINATION OF EVERYBODY WITH ONE EXCEPTION
WE HAVE MORE BLACK AND BROWN MEN WHO ARE INCARCERATED
BUT HERE'S WHAT I WOULDN'T TELL THEM
I TRY TO SHARE THIS EVERYWHERE I GO
THIS IS WHAT I FOUND OUT
I DISCOVERED THAT THERE'S A MOVEMENT FOR A BETTER WAY
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT ME MY BROTHER AND SISTER ACTUALLY LIKE EATING BAKED KALE CHIPS
WHAT'S THE POINT ABOUT WORRYING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT MIGHT HAPPEN
AND IT DOESN'T WORK
WE ALL KNOW THAT
AND HOW WAS IT DOING IT
SO WHAT DO WE SEE
WHAT IS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT YOU WILL SUFFER HEARING LOSS IN YOUR FUTURE
AND THE THIRD PRINCIPLE IS PROGRESS MONITORING
LET ME EXPLAIN
IS JUST GOING TO GET WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE
IT MEANS THAT IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GET PEOPLE'S ATTENTION YOU MIGHT WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE PROGRESS
LET ME SHOW YOU
THIS IS AN IMAGE FROM A STUDY THAT WE CONDUCTED LED BY PHD STUDENT MICAH EDELSON AND WHAT IT'S
WELL MOST PEOPLE IN A MONOLOGUE WILL SAY BEWARE
IT'S ONE OF THE PRINCIPLES OF WHAT THE BRAIN IS ACTUALLY DOING
WHAT YOU DON'T SEE HERE IS WHAT HAPPENED A FEW MONTHS LATER IN THE FINANCIAL COLLAPSE OF 2008 WHEN THE MARKET
AND IT'S NOT JUST US
AND SO THE QUESTION IS WHY
FOR EXAMPLE YOU MIGHT TELL YOURSELF
SO IN A HOSPITAL HERE IN THE UNITED STATES A CAMERA WAS INSTALLED TO SEE HOW OFTEN MEDICAL STAFF
WELL THEY KIND OF GET UNSTABLE
WE CAN USE THAT AND ONCE IT'S DONE WE CAN THROW THAT INTO A LANDFILL AND IT'S ESSENTIALLY BACK AS RADIOACTIVE AS
IN THE CASE OF A URANIUM FUELED REACTOR WE COULD CONTROL THE REACTION RATES BY CONTROLLING THE AMOUNT OF NEUTRONS THAT
THERE WAS A VERY SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT SAW THESE DOCUMENTS AND SAW THE SAME VISION FOR THE FUTURE THAT THE ORIGINAL
THIS IS HOW NUCLEAR REACTIONS WORK
WITH NUCLEAR REACTORS IT'S DIFFERENT
THESE ARE ISOTOPES USED IN MEDICINE SO THESE ARE USED IN EVERYTHING FROM RADIATION
IN SOME INSTANCES THAT CAN ACCOUNT FOR UP TO AS MANY AS 50 OF THE HURRICANE
IN ADDITION TO THAT WITH THE THORIUM FUEL CYCLE WE ARE ABLE TO GENERATE ADDITIONAL ISOTOPES
YES BUT STARS ACTUALLY CAN'T PRODUCE ANYTHING HEAVIER THAN IRON SO THAT'S WHERE THE MIGHTY NEUTRON COMES IN
TWO WEEKS BEFORE IT WAS SUPPOSED TO TAKE OFF AND FLY FOR USE IN THE MILITARY THE PROGRAM GOT CANCELED
BACK IN 1972 THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FINALLY DECIDED TO END IT
IN THE EARLY 2000S THEY WERE FINALLY DECLASSIFIED AND RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC
IT WILL NEVER MAKE A MISTAKE
WHEN WE OFF BOARD THAT INFORMATION TO THEM WHAT WE CAN DO IS WE CAN FOCUS ALL OF OUR ATTENTION ALL OF
I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THEM TODAY
WE TELL THE CALCULATOR TO DO THE CALCULATING AND WE DO THE ACTUAL MATH BECAUSE WE'RE THE ONLY ONES WHO CAN
WE SHOULD BE AFRAID OF LIVING IN A WORLD WHERE WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY DOING THE THINGS WE LOVE WHERE WE'RE NOT CONSTANTLY
SOMETIMES WE ARE SO AFRAID THAT WE DON'T MAKE ANY CHOICE AT ALL AND WE JUST GO WITHOUT
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M AFRAID OF AND IT SHOULDN'T BE WHAT ANYONE ELSE IS AFRAID OF EITHER
BORING PEOPLE ARE UNORIGINAL
BUT WHAT THEY ALLOWED US TO DO WAS THEY ALLOWED US TO FOCUS
THEY ALLOWED US TO DO MORE AMAZING THINGS IN OTHER WAYS
I FOUND A FEW
IT'S THAT QUESTION WHY AND WHAT'S GONE WRONG
I STILL DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT IS
THAT'S WHEN WE DISCOVERED AQUAPONICS
I HAD NOW SPENT FOUR MONTHS IN THE HOSPITAL
I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO DIE
AT THIS POINT I HAD NO POWER TO MAKE THE BIG CHANGES
I DIDN'T EVEN ASK HIM ONE SINGLE QUESTION
I WAS JUMPING WITH A CAMERA ON MY HELMET FILMING THE OTHERS
I DIDN'T SEE MY LIFE FLICKERING BEFORE MY EYES
DYING DIDN'T SCARE ME
YOU CAN BE MORE
WE ARE NOT THE SAME AND IT'S GREAT
RAISED QUITE A FEW EYEBROWS IN ICELAND
SO WHAT DO YOU GET
THAT'S HOW WE CHANGE THE WORLD
IF YOU DID A ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS TO GET TO THE WHY OF MOST EDUCATORS IT COMES BACK TO A
SO THAT BEGAN A LIFETIME OF EDUCATOR SERIAL MONOGAMY
LOVE EMBOLDENS THEM TO TRY TO COME UP WITH
IT GIVES THEM A CHANCE TO MAKE THEIR DREAMS BECOME A REALITY
YOU WANT MORE INFORMED ELECTORATE AND WHO DOESN'T
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO LIVE IN ELLA'S FAMILY
WHEN DID YOU GO TO SCHOOL
SO SOME YEARS AGO WANTING TO UNDERSTAND THIS PROBLEM I STARTED TO WORK WITH A GROUP OF ABOUT 60 OLDER PEOPLE IN SOUTH
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE SIMPLE HUMAN BONDS BETWEEN US A KIND OF AUTHENTIC SENSE OF CONNECTION OF BELONGING THE BONDS THAT
WELL THE FIRST THING I LEARNED IS THAT COST IS A REALLY SLIPPERY CONCEPT
THEY'VE CALLED BECAUSE THEIR PETS ARE UNWELL THEIR DVD IS BROKEN THEY'VE FORGOTTEN HOW TO USE THEIR MOBILE PHONE OR MAYBE THEY ARE COMING
SO EVERYONE WHO CAME INTO CONTACT WITH ELLA OR A FAMILY LIKE ELLA'S WOULD SPEND 80 PERCENT OF THEIR TIME WORKING WITH THE
THEY LED TO LONGER LIFESPANS THE ERADICATION OF MASS DISEASE MASS HOUSING ALMOST UNIVERSAL
AND DAMON WHO RUNS THE LOCAL CIRCLE CALLS HER BACK AND SAYS HOW CAN I HELP
AND ALL THE SAME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS TRANSFORMATION SAME FAMILIES SAME
THEY THINK NOTHING OF CALLING SOCIAL SERVICES TO TRY AND MEDIATE ONE OF THE MANY ARGUMENTS THAT BROKE OUT
THE TV'S ON AT FULL VOLUME
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AND WHAT WE CAN DO DIFFERENTLY
IT RULES OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF WHAT'S NEEDED TO BUILD A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TOM AND RYAN
HAVE YOU BEEN DRINKING
AND CIRCLE OFFERS ITS LOCAL MEMBERSHIP A TOLL FREE 0 800 NUMBER THAT THEY CAN CALL ON DEMAND FOR ANY
SO TOM WHO IS THE SOCIAL WORKER FOR ELLA'S 14 YEAR OLD SON RYAN HAS TO SPEND 86
AND HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS WERE ALREADY WITHERING
SO IN A REALLY BRAVE STEP THE LEADERS OF THE CITY WHERE ELLA LIVES AGREED THAT WE COULD START BY REVERSING RYAN'S RATIO
AND THE MOTHERS GO YOU'RE THE SYSTEM
SO WE RENTED A PHONE LINE HIRED A COUPLE OF HANDYMEN AND STARTED A SERVICE WE CALLED CIRCLE
AND YOU CAN CONTRAST THIS WITH A NEIGHBORHOOD ORGANIZATION OF THE 1970S WHEN THIS KIND OF SCALE JUST WASN'T POSSIBLE NEITHER WAS THE QUALITY
AND ONE MOTHER TOOK THE MONEY AND SHE USED IT AS A FLOAT TO START A SOCIAL ENTERPRISE
SO FIVE CIRCLE MEMBERS HAD ORGANIZED THEMSELVES TO TAKE CARE OF BELINDA
SO LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT BELINDA
ONE OF HER SONS IS FIGHTING WITH ONE OF HER DAUGHTERS
AND THIS KIND OF INTERACTION RULES OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A NORMAL CONVERSATION
SO PROFESSIONALS HAVE TO ADMINISTER THESE INCREASINGLY COMPLEX FORMS OF ADMINISTRATION THAT ARE BASICALLY ABOUT STOPPING
BECAUSE WHEN THE GOVERNMENT SAYS THAT A FAMILY LIKE ELLA'S COSTS A QUARTER OF A MILLION POUNDS A YEAR TO MANAGE WHAT IT REALLY
AND I ALSO SPENT TIME WITH THE FRONTLINE WORKERS AND I LEARNED THAT IT IS AN IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION
AND THE IMPACT OF BEVERIDGE ON THE WAY THE MODERN STATE SEES SOCIAL ISSUES JUST CAN'T BE UNDERESTIMATED
THEY SHOWED THEIR HUMAN QUALITIES AND CONVINCED THE MOTHERS THAT THEY WOULD STICK WITH THEM THROUGH THICK AND THIN EVEN THOUGH THEY WOULDN'T BE SOFT
BUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THEM HAS BEEN SUPPORTED TO CHANGE
BUT THE SIMPLE ACT OF ENCOURAGING HER TO COME ALONG TO THAT FIRST EVENT LED TO A PROCESS WHERE NATURAL
SO I'VE SPENT TIME LIVING WITH FAMILIES LIKE ELLA'S IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD BECAUSE I WANT TO KNOW WHAT CAN WE LEARN
THE THREE CHILDREN THAT STILL LIVE WITH HER SUFFER FROM A WHOLE RANGE OF PROBLEMS AND NONE OF THEM ARE IN EDUCATION
AND ELLA SAYS TO ME THAT SHE IS REPEATING THE CYCLE OF HER OWN MOTHER'S LIFE BEFORE HER
CIRCLE HAS GOT THIS VERY SIMPLE SYSTEM THAT UNDERPINS IT ENABLES A SMALL LOCAL TEAM TO SUPPORT A MEMBERSHIP OF UP TO A THOUSAND
THEY'VE BECOME SO INGRAINED IN US THAT ACTUALLY WE DON'T EVEN SEE THEM ANYMORE
AND THE BUREAUCRAT WHO WOULD BE DETACHED AND WORK IN THIS SYSTEM
BUT WHEN I MET ELLA THERE WERE 73 DIFFERENT SERVICES ON OFFER FOR HER AND HER FAMILY IN THE CITY WHERE SHE LIVES
THE CONTEMPORARIES OF WILLIAM BEVERIDGE WHO WAS THE ARCHITECT OF THE FIRST WELFARE STATE AND THE AUTHOR OF THE BEVERIDGE REPORT
THE CULTURES THE BUREAUCRACIES THE INSTITUTIONS THEY ARE GLOBAL AND THEY'VE COME TO SEEM LIKE
AND THE MOTHERS SAY THANK YOU
HE'S LIKE NO NO
HE WAS WORKING OVERSEAS
THE DAY WE DROP AN APPLE AND IT GOES UP THEN WE'LL HAVE A DEBATE ABOUT GRAVITY
THIRDLY IT BRINGS THE INTERESTING PEOPLE TO YOU
I GOT THIS TEXT MESSAGE BACK FROM HIM A COUPLE OF WEEKS LATER AND IT SAID I'M AT BREAKFAST IN A POSH
WE SHOULDN'T BE AFRAID TO INVESTIGATE THE PHYSICAL WORLD FOR OURSELVES WITH THE TOOLS AROUND US BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE ACCESS
YOU CAN BLAME ME IT'S FINE
THEN I LEFT THE STAGE
YOU WIN ON ALL FRONTS
WHAT CAN YOU DO WHEN YOU KNOW THAT
WHEN THESE LAWS WORK TOGETHER THEY BRING ABOUT THE BEAUTIFUL MESSY COMPLEX WORLD WE LIVE IN
WHEN YOU STOP THE OTHER ONE YOU ONLY STOP THE SHELL THE LIQUID INSIDE IS STILL ROTATING BECAUSE NOTHING'S MADE IT STOP
THESE ARE ALL SCENARIOS THAT YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO LEAVE YOUR HOME
AT THE OUTSET I FOUND THE IDEA OF HOMELESS PEOPLE KIND OF LIKE THE INDIVIDUALS I MET IN THE
BUT THE CAREER CHOICE STUCK
I'M FAR FROM A HERO
RIGHT AS YOU WALK IN THE DOOR YOU CAN TELL SOMEONE SMELLS BAD
WE'RE NOT SURE
I HAVE A QUESTION
WHAT IS THE CONTEXT
SO THEY MAY NOT LOOK LIKE HUMANS THEY MAY LOOK LIKE A VERY SMART ROBOT
BUT THEY GOT IT WRONG
WHAT CAN CHANGE PEOPLE'S OUTLOOK ON US
PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME
AS I'VE TOLD YOU I IDENTIFY AS MALE
HOW CAN WE MAKE IT MORE POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND AND ACCEPT PEOPLE LIKE ME INTO THEIR
HOW IS IT POSSIBLE FOR THIS PERSON TO GO FROM BEING SAMANTHA KATE HOBMAN TO BEING CHARLES FRANCIS
SELF DISCOVERY IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT THING THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT'S NOT ENFORCED MORE INTO
IT IS A WHOLE ENTIRE SPECTRUM
I AM MALE I IDENTIFY ENTIRELY AS MALE AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN MALE
THAT UNCERTAINTY KEPT ME WITHIN MY SHELL AND IT KEPT ME HIDING AWAY FROM WHO I AM
SO HOW CAN WE SPREAD AWARENESS
THAT'S HOW I WAS EXPRESSING MYSELF
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT TECHNICALITIES
GENDER IDENTITY IS WHAT YOU IDENTIFY AS
SO WHAT DID I DO IN MY SPARE TIME
THEY GET UP JUST A LITTLE BIT LATER EVERY DAY SAY 15 MINUTES OR SO AND THEY KIND OF DRIFT ALL THE WAY
AND SO IN THIS WAY WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE WORKING ON THEIR OWN INTERNAL CLOCKS RATHER THAN SOMEHOW SENSING THE DAY OUTSIDE
AND IN BETWEEN THEY HAVE A COUPLE OF HOURS OF SORT OF MEDITATIVE QUIET IN BED
I'VE DONE IT EVEN WITH PROGRESSIVE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS
THE LAST PERSON STANDING WE'RE GOING TO SEE WHAT THEY KNOW
AND IT'S BEEN REALLY FUN SINCE WE PUT THEM UP TO SEE WHERE THESE HAVE GONE
HE MADE A JOKE ABOUT THE PARALYMPICS
I'M A COMEDIAN
BUT THERE'S ALSO A MARKET FOR LEGGING SADOMASOCHISM AND JUSTIN BIEBER
NO OF COURSE
THIS HAPPENED THIS HAPPENED THEN THIS HAPPENED THEREFORE THIS HAPPENED
THEN SWITCH OVER TO EASTENDERS OR TRUE BLOOD WHERE THERE ARE SCENES OF MURDER SEXUAL
THEY THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT
AND PEOPLE WENT MENTAL
YOU'RE LAUGHING AT ME FOR BEING AN IDIOT FOR THINKING THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
IF WE WERE TO COME ON STAGE AND TALK TO YOU ABOUT OUR REAL OPINIONS WITH BALANCED THOUGHT THROUGH POINTS WE
AND SOMEHOW INTEGRATE MYSELF INTO THIS STORY SO I'D BECOME A HERO SO I CAN THEN GO OUT ON STAGE IN FRONT OF A
I TELL STORIES DIFFERENTLY AS WELL
THERE WAS NO MONSTER UNDER THE BED NO BOOGIE MAN IN THE CORNER
EVERYTHING'S A DIFFERENT WAY OF TELLING A STORY
WE'RE DESPERATE STORYTELLERS
OH I CAN'T BELIEVE CHRISTOPHER WALTZ KILLED ALL THOSE JEWISH PEOPLE
EVERYONE WOULD AGREE THAT MY DAD'S A DREADFUL MAN
BUT WE CAN'T BE OUR TRUE SELVES
WHEREAS MOST OF THE TIME IT'S A HARDSHIP THAT'S CAUSED US TO GET INTO COMEDY
THAT'S NOT FAIR
AND SOMETIMES WE TURN IT IN A WAY THAT YOU DON'T LIKE
THERE IS A MARKET FOR SHOCK COMEDY
TAKE IT HOME
MORAL OF THIS STORY IS
IT'S ALWAYS STUFF LIKE
YOU DON'T TAKE OTHER STORYTELLER'S STORIES OUT OF CONTEXT
WE MIGHT PLAY A VERSION OF OURSELVES
THAT'S WHEN SHE KNEW ABOUT IT
OUR REACTION TO OUR HARDSHIPS WAS TO MAKE LIGHT OF THE SITUATION AND GET OVER IT AS OPPOSED TO GOING ROUND THE COUNTRY MAKING SURE THAT
NO COMEDIAN WANTS TO OFFEND YOU THAT'S NOT OUR JOB
I THINK EVERY CHILD UNDER THE AGE OF 13 SHOULD BE FORCED TO SMOKE FOUR PACKS OF CIGARETTES A
IF AT ANY POINT YOU'VE DIS AGREED WITH ANYTHING I'VE SAID DON'T WORRY IT WAS JUST A STORY I MADE IT ALL UP
A HUGE MARKET OK
YOU'RE NOT LAUGHING AT THE FACT THAT I'M TRYING TO KILL MY BROTHERS
IT SEEMS THE GENERAL PUBLIC CAN SAY WHATEVER THEY WANT ABOUT CELEBRITIES BUT COMEDIANS CAN'T AND THAT'S HYPOCRISY
SHE'S ON HER THIRD MARTINI SHE'S READY TO GO
I AM SURE MANY OTHERS
THEY WALKED IN AND THEY SAW A BULLET HOLE HAD GONE THROUGH THE CHALKBOARD THE
I SOUGHT TO CHANGE THE WAY WOMEN VIEWED THEMSELVES AND THEIR HAIR
I REMEMBER MY MOM PUT ME IN SUMMER CAMP AND I CAME HOME FROM SUMMER CAMP I GOT IN THE
SHE SAID THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT BOYS AND KISSING AND MUCH LIKE WHAT HAPPENED IN SOUTH CENTRAL MOMS OH
SHE MOVED US TO WESTCHESTER CALIFORNIA WHICH IS ONLY THREE MILES AWAY
AND I SPENT ABOUT THREE YEARS RESEARCHING
WE STRIP AWAY FACTS WHICH ARE CONFUSING IN REALITY
BY THE WAY I'M NOT A MORAL AUTHORITY
FOR EVERY TIME THAT YOU ANNOUNCE THAT YOU HAD A TAILS THROW YOU GET PAID FIVE FRANCS
BUT I DON'T KNOW YET HOW THIS DEVELOPS OVER A LIFETIME
IN OTHER WORDS THIS IS A VERY ECONOMIC MOTIVATION OF TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO BE MORE HONEST
REALITY IS SO RICH THERE IS SO MUCH GOING ON IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW WHAT DRIVES PEOPLE'S
I DO NOT YET KNOW WHERE THESE PROTECTED VALUES REALLY COME FROM
WE LOOK AT THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE HAVE SO CALLED PROTECTED VALUES
IT LOOKS PRETTY SIMILAR FOR THOSE WHO HAD STUDIED ECONOMICS OR THOSE WHO HAD STUDIED
BUT DO THINK ABOUT SELECTING THE RIGHT PEOPLE RATHER THAN HAVING PEOPLE AND THEN
I'M NOT SAYING I HAVE ALL THESE BEAUTIFUL VALUES RIGHT
YOU LEAVE 20 FRANCS ON THE TABLE BY ANNOUNCING ZERO
WELL IT SEEMS PEOPLE ARE MOTIVATED BY CERTAIN INTRINSIC VALUES AND IN OUR RESEARCH WE LOOK AT
IN OTHER WORDS IT WILL PAY OFF TO PUT PEOPLE FIRST
PEOPLE ARE MOTIVATED BY DIFFERENT VALUES PERHAPS
THIS IS NOT PETTY FRAUD
HOW DOES THAT PLAY OUT
AND ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU DISREGARD IT THEN THERE ARE HIGHER CHANCES OF NOT GETTING YOUR BONUS OR ITS BEING
SELECTING THE RIGHT PEOPLE WITH THE RIGHT VALUES MAY GO A LONG WAY TO SAVING A LOT OF TROUBLE
BEGINNING MIDDLE AND END
BUT I NEVER FOUND THAT REALLY SUPER INSIGHTFUL
THEY HAVE FIVE
SO WHEN I WAS 15 I QUIT SCHOOL
I SERIOUSLY THOUGHT THAT I WOULD NOT LIVE TILL 20
EMBRYONIC PLURIPOTENT STEM CELLS ARE THE TYPE OF STEM CELL THAT PEOPLE MOST OFTEN
PUT UP YOUR HANDS
AND NOW THAT YOU HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE YOU HAVE THE POWER
BUT IT WAS MUCH MORE ELABORATE THEY WENT TO GREAT LENGTHS TO PUT MONEY IN SAMI OSMAKAC'S HANDS WHICH HE THEN USED TO PURCHASE
COMPARE THAN TO JUST 2
THESE INCLUDE THE BOSTON MARATHON BOMBINGS IN 2013 AS WELL AS FAILED ATTACKS SUCH AS THE TIME WHEN A MAN NAMED FAISAL
THESE OPERATIONS WHICH ARE USUALLY LED BY AN INFORMANT PROVIDE THE MEANS AND OPPORTUNITY AND SOMETIMES EVEN THE
BERKELEY AND A RESEARCH ASSISTANT AND I PUT TOGETHER A DATABASE OF ALL TERRORISM PROSECUTIONS AT THE TIME
SAM JUST KEEPS STARING
AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT BELONGING IS CORRELATED WITH
HOW DO YOU WANT TO SPEND YOUR TIME
WHO I REALLY AM
I'M ESSENTIALLY DROPPING A BASIC IDEA INTO A GROUP INTO A COMMUNITY PEOPLE START GRAVITATING TO
THERE'S A REASON YOU REMEMBER THINGS
AND I WAS LIKE DUH
AND THAT SUN DIDN'T SET I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT MELTED
AND THAT WAS THE A HA MOMENT
WE WERE GOING TO TAKE PHOTOS OF US WITH HIM ON MAJOR WORLD LANDMARKS
SO WE WATCHED THAT SUN
WE TRIED TO HAVE SOME EXPERIENCES THAT WE WOULDN'T OTHERWISE HAVE
WE ENGAGED WITH PEOPLE WE STAYED AT A CATTLE RANCH IN THE AUSTRALIAN BUSH COUNTRY WHERE I'M NOT QUITE SURE
WE REALIZED THAT OUR LIFE WAS CHANGING AND WE WERE CHANGING WITH IT
I DECIDED TO BECOME THAT BLACK SQUARE
I'M SURE THAT NOW NOT ONLY DOES HE NARRATE ABOUT THE CORPSES THAT LAY BELOW BUT ALSO ABOUT THE CRAZY
IN ARCHETYPES SUCH AS SIREN THE VOICES THAT LURE SAILORS TO A WATERY GRAVE OR LA
I DON T KNOW IF I'M GOOD
AND MY JOB WAS IN THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT
SO LAUGH AT YOURSELF
WE HAD TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT
IT WAS MOSTLY ITALIAN AMERICAN
AND OF COURSE I WAS VERY ANGRY
IN FACT IT WAS OUR WHOLE ECONOMY
I SAID ALL RIGHT DAD
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE SPECTATORS THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WATCH FROM THE SIDELINES AND THERE ARE THOSE THAT GIVE THEIR
WE COULDN'T JUST GO ON THE RADIO HAVE 60 MILLION PEOPLE ACTIVATED
GO BACK TO THE WEBSITE AND SIGN UP
GOV FROM THE VIDEO HAD NEVER BEEN TO THE WEBSITE BEFORE
I SAID ALL RIGHT
I WAS SO EMBARRASSED
I'M NOT GOING TO KNOW ANYONE
I LL PLAY AS HARD AS I CAN
THEY CALLED ME CHINESE BOY
AND THAT IS AT THE TENDER AGE OF NINE YEARS OLD I THOUGHT OF MYSELF
WE WENT TO THE FUNNIEST PEOPLE ON THE PLANET A COMPANY CALLED FUNNY OR DIE
I'M SHOWING UP AS A LISTENER
I BELIEVE THAT THAT ONE SIMPLE ACT HAS THE POWER TO ENHANCE OUR INDIVIDUAL WELL BEING AND IMPROVE OUR CHANCES FOR
WHAT IF WE SURROUNDED OUR SCHOOLS WITH NATIVE PLANTS WHICH ATTRACTED NATIVE ANIMALS WHICH CREATED
WHO KNOWS HOW FAR WE COULD GO IF WE FUNDED AND CELEBRATED OUR LISTENERS AS MUCH OR MORE THAN OUR SPEECH
IF I NAME YOU I ASSUME YOU DON'T HAVE A NAME FOR YOURSELF OR IF YOU DO I DON'T CARE
FORMAL CHOIRS AND BACKYARD JAMS RECORDING SESSIONS AND BAND PRACTICES
IT'S BASIC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY
BUT WHAT IF WE MADE A CONSCIOUS CHOICE TO REVERSE THIS TREND
IT'S HARD TO ALLOW OTHER SYSTEMS AND OTHER DEVICES INTO YOUR SPACE
IT'S A SOCIABLE RADIO IT'S A SOCIETY OF RADIOS A SOCIAL NETWORK OF RADIOS IS THE WAY I SEE IT
BUT IF EVERYONE WAS TO START WHISPERING IT WOULD INTERFERE WITH ME EVENTUALLY
AND ANOTHER TERM FOR THIS IS A USER DEPLOYED INFRASTRUCTURE
THEY ALSO CHALLENGE HOW WE CONSUME SO WE'RE MOVING AWAY FROM OWNERSHIP TO ACCESS WE'RE MOVING
DESPITE THEM BEING EMPTY OR DESPITE THEM BEING LIGHTLY USED NO ONE ELSE EXCEPT THE OWNER OF
WE DON'T NEED TO BE AN EXPERT BECAUSE THE EXPERTEES WILL RESIDE IN THESE RADIOS
THE BEST WAY FOR ME TO EXPLAIN THIS AT THE MOMENT IS TO THINK ABOUT THIS VENUE
IT'S NEVER ABOUT THE PHYSICAL ENTITY OF THE NETWORK ITSELF
THEY CAN CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR
WE GIVE IT EYES AND EARS BY ADDING SOPHISTICATED SENSORS THAT ALLOW IT TO OBSERVE THE WORLD AROUND IT
IN MY OPINION WE IGNORE THE PHYSICALITY OF THE NETWORK THE NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE AT OUR PERIL
WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THAT EVERYBODY HERE CAN DEPLOY WIFI
WE CAN JUST GO OUT AND PUT IT OUT THERE
THE REALITY IS THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO THINK ABOUT THESE THINGS OR ENGAGE IN DEBATE ABOUT THEM
HOW DO WE DO THAT
WE TAKE A MOBILE PHONE WHICH IS ALREADY A FAIRLY FANTASTIC AND AMAZING DEVICE WITH HUGE AMOUNT OF CAPABILITIES AND WE
WE DON'T NEED TO BE AN EXPERT
THEY FIGURE THINGS OUT THEY DECIDE WHAT INTERFERENCES SOMEBODY DOESN'T TELL THEM WHAT IT IS
I THINK IT'S REALLY REALLY INTERESTING TO THINK OF THE RESOURCE LIKE THAT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE DO TO A LOT OF RESOURCES IN THE WORLD TODAY
THEY'D SOMEHOW FIGURED OUT THAT HIGHER UP THE SIGNAL WAS GOOD SO THAT IF THEY CAREFULLY COORDINATED JUMPING AND
AS THE WORLD BECOMES INCREASINGLY INSTRUMENTED WITH SENSORS WE WANT TO ACTUALLY ALSO TALK TO THE OBJECTS IN OUR LIVES
IT'S CROWDED THERE'S VERY VERY LITTLE SPACE IT'S REALLY REALLY HARD TO GET ACCESS TO THE EMPTY FREQUENCIES IT'S
IF YOU HAVE TO STAND BACK AND ASK WHY THAT IT REALLY IS BECAUSE OF FEAR
I THINK HE DOESN'T LIKE ME
ARE YOU RELIABLE
I'M SAYING THIS BECAUSE ONE OF MY MAJOR POINTS IS WHAT WENT RIGHT IS ALSO WHAT
AND BY THE WAY MISTRUST WAS ALWAYS VERY IMPORTANT FOR DEMOCRACY
SO THIS IS NOT BY ACCIDENT THAT THE VOTERS ARE NOT INTERESTED TO VOTE ANYMORE
AND THIS IS GOETHE WHO IS NEITHER BULGARIAN NOR A POLITICAL SCIENTIST SOME CENTURIES AGO HE
THIS IS WHY BASICALLY YOU HAVE ALL THIS CREATIVE MISTRUST BETWEEN THE REPRESENTATIVES AND THOSE WHOM
SO I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO THE PRIME MINISTER WHY HE MADE THIS DECISION
SO AS A RESULT OF IT YOU HAVE THIS VERY STRANGE SITUATION IN WHICH THE ELITES BASICALLY GOT
YOU KNOW WHO TO ARREST WHO TO NEGOTIATE WITH
YOU CANNOT TAX THEM
THESE ARE NOT JUST GLOBAL CHALLENGES BUT INTERCONNECTED URBAN ONES AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE MASSIVELY AMPLIFIED AND
EVERYTHING FROM INFRASTRUCTURE TO OUR WATER SUPPLY EVERYTHING FROM OUR DIET
WELL THERE'S TWO PRINCIPLE WAYS
WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE A LASTING IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT
YOU PUT THEM INTO WATER WHERE THEY BREED
IT'S NOT VERY EXPENSIVE BECAUSE IT'S A COFFEE CUP SOMETHING THE SIZE OF A COFFEE CUP WILL HOLD
AND THAT'S THE NICKNAME GIVEN TO THIS DISEASE
YOU USE CHEMICALS
IF THEY MATE SUCCESSFULLY THEN NO OFFSPRING
IT HAS TO BE SAFE
WE ARE GOING TO USE IT IN AND AROUND HUMANS
SO WE'VE DONE FIELD TRIALS NOW IN THE CAYMAN ISLANDS A SMALL ONE IN MALAYSIA AND TWO MORE
AND I'M IN FAVOR ACTUALLY
IT'S INVADED YOU
NOW IN AN URBAN ENVIRONMENT THAT'S EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT
AND THE MOSQUITO HAS KILLED MORE HUMANS THAN WARS AND PLAGUE
THAT'S TWO DAYS AGO
BEING INFECTED EVERY YEAR
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
IT'S THE SAME MOSQUITO AND IT'S THE SAME DISEASE
OF COURSE I AM
SO ALL OF MY CHILDHOOD PRACTICE CAME IN HANDY AND I GOT THE JOB
SO I DECIDED I WAS GOING TO START WORKING WITH UNDERWATER PHOTOGRAPHERS
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
SO I HAD TO CREATE EVERYTHING FROM SCRATCH
BY BRIDGING LAND AND SEA AS A MERMAID WITH A CAUSE WE WERE ABLE TO APPEAL TO PEOPLE'S
THAT WOULD HAVE INCREDIBLY DIRE CONSEQUENCES FOR OUR ENTIRE ECOSYSTEM
ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING EXPERIENCES I EVER HAD WAS SWIMMING WITH A HUMPBACK WHALE AND HER
BACK ON LAND MY JOY BEGAN TO TURN TO HORROR AND DISMAY AS I REALIZED THAT THESE
NONE COULD HOLD THEIR BREATH UNDERWATER
SOME MAY SAY THAT THIS IS A FANTASY
BUT I JUST KEPT TRYING
NOW I'M NOT REALLY MODEL HEIGHT SO WHEN I GOT THERE AND I WAS SURROUNDED BY THESE GLAMOROUS AMAZONS I THOUGHT
AND INDEED LOVE IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS BECAUSE ALMOST EVERY ONE OF US PURSUE LOVE EVEN THOUGH WE
AND THE ALGORITHM WAS
THAT IS WHAT IT TAKES TO CHANGE THE WORLD
EVENTUALLY I'M LIKE OH MY GOD OK
MY BRAIN WAS LIKE WHAT ARE YOU DOING MAN
THIS WASN'T IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME
AND TO ME IT HAS AN ANSWER
IN US THE UNIVERSE IS THINKING ABOUT ITSELF
WHY IN AMERICAN SOCIETY DO WE STILL HAVE WELL IN SOCIETIES IN GENERAL BUT
TO ME THAT'S A VALID QUESTION
IT'S NOT FROM A POEM
SO IF THIS IS SUCH A SMALL SAMPLE OF THE WHOLE HEAVENS WE
THAT'S A SCIENTIFIC FACT
WE ACTUALLY USE WAVE TECHNOLOGY ON OUR OPEN POND SYSTEMS WE HAVE 95 MIXING AND
IT SMELLS LIKE THE FEET OF ANGELS
YOU ALREADY HAVE
SHE DID ONE OF THOSE LITTLE POINT ON MY CHEST THINGS SHE SAID
YOU'RE IN IRAN ANYTIME SOMETHING'S FRUSTRATING TO US AND OUT OF OUR CONTROL WE SAY DEATH TO THAT
THAT'S THE MARK OF A GOOD TRIP
A GREAT SORT OF LEARNING AREA WADING POOL FOR WORLD EXPLORATION TO ME IS EUROPE
TO BE THERE AS TOUR GUIDE WITH MY GROUP WATCHING HIM HIS HEAD TILTED OVER HIS ROBE THEN GOES OUT AND HE LOSES
IT DOESN'T DIMINISH OURS BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO REMEMBER IN OUR TRAVELS THAT THERE ARE OTHER HEROES
I KNEW THIS DERVISH AND I ASKED HIM
MY FRIENDS IN EUROPE ALWAYS REMIND ME
I WAS HEADING FOR MAZATL N AND I WAS JUST NEEDY FOR A NICE STRETCH OF PRISTINE BEACH SWEPT FREE OF
NOW APPRECIATING THE VALUE OF TRAVEL IS NOTHING NEW
WHY ARE YOU GOING TO IRAN
A FEW YEARS AGO I WAS DUE FOR A VACATION
AND IF I AM MAKING A TOUR OR A GUIDEBOOK OR A TV SHOW AND I AM NOT CONNECTING PEOPLE WITH PEOPLE I AM KIND OF NERVOUS BECAUSE
WELL IN THE ADULTHOOD YOU REALIZE
BULGARIANS HAVE THE BULGARIAN DREAM
YOU NEED TO GO THERE AND MEET THESE PEOPLE
NORWEGIANS HAVE THE NORWEGIAN DREAM
I'M A DERVISH THAT'S LIKE A MONK THAT FOLLOWS MEVLANA THAT'S SORT OF A TEACHER IN ISLAM
AND AHEAD OF ME I HEAR THE LONG LEGATO TONES OF AN ALPHORN ANNOUNCING THAT THE HELICOPTER STOCKED MOUNTAIN HUT IS OPEN
ONE GREAT WAY TO MAKE YOUR TRAVELS MORE MEANINGFUL IS TO RELATE TO TO EMBRACE A
WELL YOU KNOW THEY GREW UP WITH THE SHAH ON THE THRONE
I'VE GOT A GOOD FRIEND IN SWITZERLAND WHO'S A SCHOOL TEACHER IN A LITTLE TRADITIONAL VILLAGE WHERE ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS THE SAME LAST
A PRESENT DAY NATHAN HALE
A SOCIETY HAS TO MAKE A CHOICE TOLERATE ALTERNATIVE LIFE STYLES OR BUILD MORE PRISONS
IRAN HAS GOT BAGGAGE AND WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH THEM SMARTLY
IN EUROPE THEY'VE GOT THE SAME VICTIMLESS CRIME ISSUES AND THEY HAVE DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO THEM
IT'S A THRIVING COUNTRY OF 70 MILLION PEOPLE
CUT GLASS PEAKS AGAINST THAT BLUE SKY
1400 YEARS AGO MOHAMMED SAID
AND I'LL TELL YOU
AND I'D LIKE TO TAKE JUST A FEW MINUTES TO EXPLAIN TO YOU WHY
WHY DO AMERICANS HAVE SUCH SOFT BREAD
AND I WHIRL AND I WHIRL AND I LOSE MYSELF IN THAT TRANSE THINKING OF THE TEACHINGS OF MEVLANA
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT MAKES THEM TICK
IN OTHER WORDS IT'S HELPED ME TO BECOME A BETTER CITIZEN OF THIS PLANET
I THINK IT'S INTERESTING WHEN YOU GO TO SCANDINAVIA HOW MANY DRUNK TEENAGERS YOU FIND ON DECORATED TRUCKS
SMELL THIS CHEESE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
AND I WANT TO KNOW THAT CAUSE I WANT TO EMPATHIZE WITH THAT CAUSE
WELL IT'S BEEN 25 YEARS SINCE THEY ARRESTED A POT SMOKER IN THE NETHERLANDS AND WHAT THEY FOUND AFTER 25 YEARS IS
JUST SAY NO
I JUST LOVE TURKEY AND AS A TOUR GUIDE I HAD THE CHANCE TO TAKE A GROUP TO GET TO KNOW A WHIRLING DERVISH
I SAID YEAH
WHEN I AM TRAVELING I FIND THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT SLICES OF CULTURE THAT I NEVER REALIZED PEOPLE COULD BE
I THOUGHT WELL HAVE I EVER SAID DAMN SOMETHING
AND FOR 30 YEARS I'VE HAD THE POOR REACHING IN MY WINDOW
AN EASY ONE IS
I THINK OF IT AS A 21ST CENTURY BUDDHA
AND THE TRUTH IS THAT THE WORLD IS A LOT BIGGER THAN THAT
THEY MAKE THEIR OWN
THIS IS A COLLAGE THAT SOMEBODY MADE ON FLICKR AND THESE WERE ALL JUST PICTURES THAT MADE HER REALLY HAPPY THAT WEEK
AND IT S SO TRAGIC
AND THAT HAS REALLY SPREAD THROUGH THE INTERNET LIKE WILDFIRE
THEY MAKE THEIR OWN LISTS
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING TO SEE
I FLEW HERE ACTUALLY FROM NECKER ISLAND
THE FOUNDER OR THE MANAGER HAS TO ANSWER IT
HOW CAN I HELP BRING THEM BACK
I WISH YOU WATER
WHAT WILL WE DO WITH IT
I'VE BEEN PART OF DRIVING THEM TO EXTINCTION HOW CAN I HELP TO BRING THEM BACK
WHY NOT APPLY NEUROSCIENCE TO FIXING NATURE
AND I USED TO TRY TO TALK ABOUT THAT AS A SCIENTIST AND I WOULD GET PUSH BACK FROM MY GRADUATE SCHOOL
THIS GENERATION IS THE FIRST GENERATION WITH A USER'S GUIDE TO THE HUMAN BRAIN
AND THE QUESTION IS HOW WILL WE USE IT
FOR EXAMPLE YOUR MIND JUST ALWAYS RUNS AT THE SAME SPEED BUT AN EM CAN ADD MORE OR LESS COMPUTER HARDWARE TO RUN FASTER OR SLOWER
I HATE THIS
NOW YOU MIGHT WONDER WHY WOULD EMS LET HUMANS EXIST
THE IDEA IS TO PORT THE SOFTWARE FROM THE HUMAN BRAIN
I JUST WON'T REMEMBER WHAT I DID
SUBJECTIVELY THEY REMEMBER A LIFE OF LEISURE
TO DO THIS WE'RE GOING TO NEED THREE TECHNOLOGIES TO BE GOOD ENOUGH AND NONE OF THEM ARE THERE YET
BUT THEY DON'T KNOW MUCH THEY CAN'T INFLUENCE MUCH AND THEY'RE OBSESSED WITH THE PAST SO WHAT'S THE POINT
IF YOU MADE ONE OF ME IS THAT ME OR SOMEONE ELSE
IF YOU ASK IT TO DO THINGS IT MIGHT DO THEM
AND IF WE COULD DO THAT EVERYTHING WOULD CHANGE
IF YOU MADE ONE WOULD IT BE CONSCIOUS
I WILL NOT SURVIVE
SHE WANTS TO BRING HER MOTHER AND HER FATHER AND HER YOUNGER
SHE WANTS TO REUNITE WITH HER FAMILY THERE
I DON'T HAVE THE COURAGE ANYMORE
SHE NEVER LEARNED TO SWIM
WE WILL MAKE IT TO SWEDEN WE WILL GET MARRIED AND WE WILL HAVE A FUTURE
AROUND THEM THERE WERE CORPSES
ONE HOT OCTOBER MORNING I GOT OFF THE ALL NIGHT TRAIN IN
AND IT'S A STORY ABOUT A JAPANESE AMERICAN DETECTIVE IN LOS ANGELES IN
BUT I THINK WHAT WE CAN ALL AGREE ON IS THAT ACTUAL PHOTOGRAPHS OF HUMAN
I'VE BEEN USING IT FOR A WHILE AND I'M USED TO IT
BUT I BELIEVE THAT ORCAS DON'T BELONG IN CAPTIVITY BECAUSE THIS DESTROYS FAMILY
COLLABORATION ADDS CAPACITY AND IT ALSO BUILDS TRUST
SO NOW THEY'RE ORDERING OUT OF A FIELD INSTEAD OF OUT OF INVENTORY IN A WAREHOUSE
IT WAS DESIGNED FOR THREE OTHER GOALS
BUT IT'S NOT FOR ALL FARMERS
GROWERS COOPERATING INFORMALLY
AS IT WENT OFF I TOOK OFF AND SAFELY GOT TO THE OTHER SIDE
WHAT'S GOING ON
THINGS WERE GOING PRETTY WELL
I KNEW THERE HAD TO BE ALL SORTS OF SYSTEMS AND TECHNIQUES AND TRAINING TO HAVE TO LIVE A FULL AND
LOOK AT THAT
AND I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO YOU ONCE IN THE FOUR YEARS SINCE THAT DAY
I KNEW I HAD TO QUIT
I KNEW I WAS WHERE I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE I KNEW I WAS HOME
AND IF YOU CHANGE ONE PERSON'S UNDERSTANDING OF IT UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THEY'RE CAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING OF HOW MUCH PEOPLE CARE
IT IS THAT WE ARE POWERFUL BEYOND MEASURE
IF YOU THINK YOU HAVEN'T THINK OF ALL THE HANDS THAT DIDN'T GO UP WHEN I ASKED
YOU'RE JUST ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO HASN'T BEEN TOLD
WE'VE MADE IT ABOUT CHANGING THE WORLD
WE LOVE YOU NO MATTER WHAT
SHE SAYS SO I WENT THE NEXT DAY
I WAS IN LINE FOR REGISTRATION AND I LOOKED AROUND AND JUST KNEW I COULDN'T DO IT I WASN'T READY
THE QUESTION THEN BECOMES WELL ALRIGHT HOW ARE WE DOING
HELLO GOOD MORNING IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE WITH YOU
IT'S ABOUT ONE PERCENT
THE PERSPECTIVE IS VERY SIMPLY THIS
COUNSELING OFFERED ACROSS THE ENTIRE QUITTING PROCESS IN PERSON AND POSSIBLY OVER THE
AND EITHER WAY WE'RE LEFT WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT ARE THE STEPS WE NEED TO TAKE SO THAT THE NEXT INTERVENTION WE
ONLY WHEN THEY HAD A SET OF COMPONENTS WHERE THEY UNDERSTOOD THE OPERATION OF THE COMPONENTS REALLY WELL THEY WERE
THINGS ARE DIFFERENT NOW OF COURSE MANY FEWER PEOPLE SMOKE
THESE EXPERIMENTS ARE TAKING PLACE IN ORDINARY HEALTHCARE SETTINGS WHERE YOU MIGHT GO IF YOU NEEDED A ROUTINE
SO FOR EXAMPLE A BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTION FOR SMOKING CESSATION MIGHT INCLUDE PRE CESSATION
WE'RE EXAMINING THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE 15 COMPONENTS IN A SET OF 3
NOW LET'S THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A SECOND
WHAT IF WE STARTED USING ENGINEERING APPROACHES TO DEVELOP BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS
IF IT TURNS OUT THAT THE INTERVENTION THAT THE INTERVENTION FAILED IT DIDN'T WORK WE DON'T KNOW WHY IT DIDN'T WORK
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH THAT APPROACH
HE QUIT SMOKING AS A RESULT OF READING THAT REPORT AND SO DID MANY OTHER PEOPLE
OUR HOPE IS THAT AFTER WE'VE DEVELOPED THIS BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTION THE WORK OF OTHERS AND POSSIBLY OUR FUTURE
I THINK WE CAN IF WE TAKE A PAGE FROM NASA'S BOOK AND ENGINEER BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS
AND YET WE HAVE NOT BEEN WORKING PROGRAMMATICALLY TOWARD BETTER AND BETTER AND BETTER BEHAVIORAL
DID ANY OF THOSE PROTOTYPE SPACECRAFT FAIL
BECAUSE I REMEMBER MY FATHER'S REACTION TO THE REPORT
THE IDEA IS TO JUST TO KEEP GETTING BETTER AND BETTER AND BETTER
WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF ANALYZING IT NOW
SUPERVISED PRACTICE QUIT ATTEMPTS SO THAT THE PERSON WILL HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT IT'S LIKE WHEN THEY QUIT SMOKING FOR REAL
NOT ONLY WORLDWIDE BUT JUST HERE IN THE UNITED STATES
AND PERHAPS EVEN MORE DISTURBING THE EQUIVALENT OF THE UNDERGRADUATE POPULATION HERE AT UNIVERSITY PARK
AND THINK ABOUT THAT IT'S NOT JUST THE FRESHMAN NOT JUST THE SOPHOMORES AND NOT JUST ONE YEAR BUT
OR BETTER IN SOME OTHER INCREMENTAL WAY
HAD I FORGOTTEN TO TEACH FEMINISM
SO I RARELY UNDERSTAND THEM ANYWAY
I MAKE MY BED FIVE MINUTES AFTER I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING
NOT EVERYONE IN MY HOUSE AGREES ON THE TOPIC OF GENDER AND I ALLOW FOR THAT
WE'LL BE ABLE TO IMAGINE BEYOND
I THOUGHT MAYBE I HAD DONE SOMETHING WRONG AS A PARENT
AND THEN YOU MAY ASK WELL IF WE GO BEYOND GENDER WHERE WILL WE END UP AS A SOCIETY AS A COMMUNITY AS
I COULD ONLY THINK ABOUT GENDER LIKE WHAT IS A MAN
AND I'M NOT GOING TO ANY BLACK COLLEGE FOR THAT MATTER
SO IN MY FAMILY HAIR IS LOVE
THEY'RE KIND OF LIKE THE HOW AND THE WHY WE TICK
BUT EVENTUALLY I HAD TO LET GEORGIA TO FIND FEMALE BLACKNESS FOR HERSELF AND THEN SUPPORT IT
THIS IS THE WAY GOD MADE ME
GO BEYOND WHAT YOU'VE BEEN TAUGHT TO BE AS A WOMAN AND BE ANYTHING OR EVERYTHING
I THINK IN MY OPINION HUMANS WANT THE WORLD TO BE SAFE AND SMALL AND SO OUR LANGUAGE OFTENTIMES REFLECTS THAT
I LOVE FOR MEN TO OPEN THE DOOR FOR ME BUT I INSIST ON CARRYING MY OWN LUGGAGE
THEY TELL US IF WE CAN INTER BE IF WE CAN GET ALONG
I HEARD A QUOTE THAT I REALLY LIKE
BABY WOULD YOU LIKE TO CHANGE YOUR NAME TO SOMETHING MORE BOYISH SOMETHING THAT CAN ALLOW PEOPLE TO
HAD I FORGOTTEN TO TEACH SELF PRIDE
I TOSSED OUT THE SHINY MARY JANES AND BROUGHT IN THE TIMBERLAND BOOTS
I THREW AWAY THE TOOTHBRUSHES WITH PRINCESSES ON THEM AND BROUGHT IN THE ONES WITH SPIDER MAN
AND PENELOPE WITHOUT MISSING A BEAT SAID NO MAMA I DON'T FEEL LIKE A BOY
AS A WOMAN AS A BLACK PERSON I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE MISLABELLED
THAT WAS HOW THE WORLD HAD TREATED HER AND THAT WAS HOW SHE HAD COME TO FEEL
THINK OF THE BIG THINGS AND THINK OF THE SMALL ONES
SHE TALKED ABOUT FONDNESS FOR THOSE THINGS
IT'S NOT BEING EGOCENTRIC
SO HOW DO WE CHANGE OURSELVES
AND CRIME LED TO PRISON AND PRISON LED TO THE CHAIR IN THE CORNER OF MY OFFICE
THAT IS SELF LOVE
IT'S THAT SELF ESTEEM THAT ENABLES US TO BE OURSELVES TO CONFIDENTLY BE
AND SHE TALKED AND TALKED MAYBE I WOULD JUST USE ON WEDNESDAYS
IT'S NOT BEING SELF ABSORBED
IT'S JUST BEING REALISTIC
IT IS NOT PERFECT BUT IT IS GOOD
YOU MIGHT LITERALLY HAVE SAID THAT
BUT I CAN DO A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS
THEN SHE FOUND SELF LOVE
AND WE'RE ABLE TO SAY THAT'S GOOD
IF THAT'S MY CONCERN HERE'S MY HOPE
THIS IS MY CONCERN
THE PEOPLE AROUND US MISS OUT ON SO MUCH AS WELL
THEY MISS OUT ON THAT UNIQUE GIFT THAT ONLY WE CAN BRING TO THEM
IT'S JUST SAYING THERE ARE THINGS I DO THAT GO WELL
BUT IF YOU DO THE SEARCH FOR THE AMERICAN SPELLING THE NUMBER ONE SEARCH RESULT IS SOME TRENDY IPHONE PHOTO SHARING APP
AND I FOUND THAT IT CAN GIVE YOU BETTER SEARCH RESULTS
AND WE GET TO DO IT THROUGH THE TINY HUMANS WE'RE RAISING
ALL OF THIS BRINGS ME AROUND TO THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT I LEARNED FROM THE RESEARCH FROM MY OWN LIFE AND WHAT I
AND THAT IDEA OF MICROBRAVERY
WE GET TO PARENT THEM
IT APPLIES TO YOU TOO
SO WHEN YOUR KIDS ARE AFRAID OF SOMETHING SMALL LIKE GOING INTO THAT DARK ROOM TO TURN ON THE LIGHT OR PETTING A FRIENDLY
RESEARCH BACKS THIS IDEA OF PRAISING EFFORT FOR NEARLY EVERYTHING WE DO IN OUR PARENTING NOT JUST IN BRAVERY
AND THAT IN GENERAL WE DON'T DO A VERY GOOD JOB OF FOSTERING AUTONOMY IN GIRLS WHICH IS A CRITICAL
I WAS IN MY CAR WITH MY THREE CHILDREN MY SON AND TWO DAUGHTERS ALL UNDER THE AGE OF 10
THE MORE WE CONDONE THE DEHUMANIZATION OF THE MUSLIM THE MORE WE TOLERATE THE VIOLENCE
WE SHARE YUSOR DEAH AND RAZAN'S STORY
TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE THAT WE CAN PLAY IN ENDING RAPE
WE ALSO LEARNED IF YOU'RE UNSURE GO REALLY FAST
HE WENT ON TO EXPLAIN THAT OPTIMISM REQUIRES EVIDENCE OF PROGRESS BUT HOPE REQUIRES NO SUCH EVIDENCE AND IS SIMPLY A
THINK ABOUT FOUR WOMEN YOU KNOW AND LOVE AND THINK ABOUT ONE OF THEM BEING SEXUALLY ASSAULTED
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RAPE AND SEX IS INFORMED CONSENT AND INFORMED CONSENT IS SIMPLY THAT EVERY STEP OF THE WAY
AND WE SOMETIMES CHOOSE TO VIEW SOME WOMEN WITH LESS INTELLIGENCE CAPABILITY AND HUMANITY AND THAT CAN LEAD TO
WHAT IF YOU FOUND OUT THE NEXT DAY THAT WHAT YOU SAW LED TO SOMEONE BEING SEXUALLY ASSAULTED OR RAPED
NOW THIS CAN BE HARD FOR US AS MEN TO HEAR
AND IT MAY FEEL LIKE SAYING NOTHING IS PLAYING IT SAFE BUT SAYING NOTHING HAS ITS OWN CONSEQUENCES
OF THE COLLEGE MEN WHO ADMITTED TO ALREADY HAVING ENGAGED IN BEHAVIORS THAT MET ONE OF THE 10 BEHAVIORS THAT MET THE LEGAL
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT JUST FOUR ASPECTS OF THE RAPE CULTURE
IF SOMEONE SAYS NO OR STOP YOU DON'T HAVE CONSENT
WE'VE HEARD NO MEANS NO AND THAT'S TRUE
FIRST THE OBJECTIFICATION OF WOMEN
WE CAN INTERVENE IN THE MOMENT WHEN WE SEE TWO HIGHLY INTOXICATED PEOPLE LEAVING TOGETHER
I HOPE YOU'LL JOIN ME
NOW CAN SPEAKING UP BE AWKWARD
FIRST OF ALL THAT MESSAGE OFTEN SAYS
20 YEARS AGO I HEARD CORNELL WEST SPEAK ABOUT RACE AND RACISM IN THIS COUNTRY
CAN YOU HAVE SO MUCH TO DRINK THAT YOU'RE NO LONGER ABLE TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION AND NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY THAT CONSENT NO LONGER IS
WE'VE LEARNED THE SAME THINGS AROUND SEXUAL INTERACTIONS
AND WHAT IF THIS DIDN'T ABSOLVE THEM OF ANY RESPONSIBILITY OR ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THEIR ACTIONS BUT MEANT THAT
WHEN IT COMES TO SEXUAL VIOLENCE I FEEL EXACTLY THE SAME WAY
WE CAN INTERVENE LONG BEFORE THOSE MOMENTS AT THE ROOT CAUSES OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE THAT MAKE THOSE MOMENTS POSSIBLE AND
BUT TOO OFTEN WE SAY TO COLLEGE MEN
IT CAN FEEL LIKE WE ARE ALL BEING BLAMED FOR THE ACTIONS OF A FEW
AS LONG AS WE'RE ONLY OUTRAGED AT THE RAPISTS AND THEIR ACTIONS AND AVOID LOOKING AT THE ROOTS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE THOSE ROOTS
IT IMPACTS VICTIMS ACROSS IDENTITIES
HE ENDED THAT TALK THEN BY SAYING HE WASN'T OPTIMISTIC BUT HE WAS HOPEFUL
THAT'S WHY TODAY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SEXUAL VIOLENCE AS A MEN'S ISSUE
IF THIS HELPS YOU CONNECT WITH THIS ISSUE THAT'S GREAT BUT FOR ME IT SELLS US AS MEN SHORT
WHEN WE SEE SOMEONE WHO'S NOT TAKING CUES THAT SOMEONE ISN'T INTERESTED OR WHEN WE SEE SOMEONE IN A VULNERABLE POSITION
HOW DO WE FREE UP MIND SPACE FOR YOU BECAUSE I KNOW THIS IS STRESSFUL FOR YOU
AFTER CHRISTMAS I WAS OUT WITH ANOTHER FRIEND WHO KNOWS TYLER WELL AND I HAD MENTIONED WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO TYLER
SO HIS APPROACH WAS
WHY DO WE FEEL SO PLEASURABLE
MY ENERGY LEVEL AFTER THE FIRST CONVERSATION WAS THROUGH THE FLOOR
AND WHAT HAPPENED WAS ANOTHER WHOLE LAYER OF WHAT MATTERS MOST CAME OUT OF A FATHER WHO ALMOST
MY FRIEND INVESTED FIVE SECONDS
WHAT WAS IT LIKE THE FIRST TIME YOU SAW HIM AGAIN
HOW DO WE TAKE STUFF OFF YOUR PLATE
I WAS DRAWN INTO THE SPACE BETWEEN
IT'S NOT OKAY SO FAR IT'S ACTUALLY A TRAIN WRECK
ZIAD IS TAKING A CLASSIC PARENTING APPROACH ASSUMING THAT HE KNOWS BEST AND
WELL SO MAYBE ORGANIC FARMING SAVES MONEY BUT PERHAPS IT PRODUCES LESS FOOD
WE'RE NOT EVEN AVERAGE
YOU MUST BE THINKING
FOR ONE THING CHIPOTLE WHICH IS THE CLOSEST WE HAVE TO A FAST FOOD ORGANIC COMPANY IS THE SINGLE FASTEST
FEED THE WORLD
THIS IS NOT A BLANKET STATEMENT IT VARIES BY CROP AND REGION BUT THERE ARE LOT OF WAYS IN WHICH WHEN DONE RIGHT
THIS IS AN APPROXIMATION THIS IS NOT VERY EXACT MATH
THAT'S NOT EFFICIENT IT'S INCREDIBLY WASTEFUL
INSTEAD WE'RE MINING MINERALS IN MORROCO SHIPPING THEM ACROSS THE ATLANTIC SPRAYING THEM ON THE FIELDS ONLY TO
DENMARK IS A COUNTRY THAT HAS FOR MANY YEARS BANNED THE USE OF SUB THERAPEUTIC ANTIBIOTICS IN LIVESTOCK
THAT'S HOW MUCH HAS ACTUALLY BEEN CONSUMED
WHAT'S THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO PRODUCE FOOD IF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO EAT MORE MEAT
THE LEADING EXPORTER OF PORK IN THE WORLD TODAY IS DENMARK
WELL GREAT BUT INDUSTRIAL AGRICULTURE FOR ALL OF ITS ILLS SURELY AT LEAST THE ONE THING IT HAS IS THAT IT'S MORE EFFICIENT
FOR EXAMPLE THINK ABOUT THE TOPSOIL
I PUT MY OWN MONEY WHERE MY MOUTH IS AND I'VE INVESTED A LOT OF MONEY IN FARMLAND LP AS I MENTIONED WHICH IS CONVERTING
IT MUST BE BECAUSE ORGANIC FARMING IS MORE EXPENSIVE RIGHT
WHO IN AMERICA IS BUYING IT
THE GENERAL U
ABOUT 20 PEOPLE OF COLOR 15 HISPANIC AND ABOUT SIX OUT OF TEN SHOP AT WALMART
IT'S BEING IMPORTED
IT WAS CHOCK FULL OF DATA AND FIGURES I HAD THREE PAGES ON MATRILINEAL MAASAI
RIGHT WHICH I ADMIT I DO
I CERTAINLY HAVE DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH
THAT IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH THAT IT'S NOT CHANGING QUICKLY ENOUGH
I SAID ON THE TED STAGE
I GOT THIS GREAT ONE OF THE FIRST LETTERS I GOT WAS FROM A WOMAN WHO SAID THAT SHE WAS OFFERED A REALLY BIG
PURSUING THE CORPORATE WORLD
THE KIND OF PARTNERS THEY WANT IF AT ALL
I MET ONE OF THEM I WAS IN BEIJING
AND IT TURNS OUT EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD WOMEN NEED MORE SELF CONFIDENCE BECAUSE THE WORLD TELLS US WE'RE NOT EQUAL TO
IF YOU ARE A BLACK WOMAN 64 CENTS
BECAUSE I THINK WHEN THE BOOK FIRST CAME OUT MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT WELL THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT HANDBOOK FOR YOUNG WOMEN
IF YOU'RE A MAN YOU'LL HAVE TO REPRESENT YOUR GENDER
THAT WOULD'VE BEEN GREAT
IT'S ALWAYS SO NICE TO LOOK OUT AND SEE SO MANY WOMEN
OR WORSE IF YOU SAY WOMAN PEOPLE ON THE OTHER END OF THE TABLE THINK YOU'RE ASKING FOR SPECIAL TREATMENT
BECAUSE YEAR AFTER YEAR I WAS ONE OF FEWER AND FEWER AND NOW OFTEN THE ONLY WOMAN IN A ROOM
IT WILL END YOUR BUSINESS CAREER
WE NEED TO BECOME AWARE ABOUT ECONOMICS AND WE NEED TO EMBRACE IT
AND THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A PERCENTAGE VALUE INCREASE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN
ALL I DID FOR YOU TODAY WAS TALK ABOUT GROWTH IN TERMS OF REAL DOLLAR VALUES IN TERMS OF
THE OTHER WAY THAT WE CAN THINK ABOUT AFFORDABILITY IS IN TERMS OF OUR INCOME
SO THAT'S WHY THE MEDIAN IS A REALLY GOOD INDICATOR OF CENTRAL TENDENCY
ONLY TALKING ABOUT PERCENTAGES IS VERY MISLEADING
THERE WILL BE JOBS
BUT IT'S EQUALLY FOOLISH TO SAY THAT OUR FATES ARE SEALED
WHY ARE THERE SO FEW FARMERS TODAY
IT'S TYPICALLY RANKED 35TH AMONG NATIONS IN HAPPINESS WHICH IS LOW FOR SUCH A WEALTHY NATION
THAT'S AMAZING PROGRESS BUT IT ALSO MEANS THERE ARE ONLY SO MANY O RING JOBS LEFT IN FARMING
WHY DOESN'T THIS MAKE OUR LABOR REDUNDANT AND OUR SKILLS OBSOLETE
AN INGENIOUS METAPHOR FOR THIS TRAGIC SETTING IS THE O RING PRODUCTION FUNCTION
PROBABLY SOMETHING ELSE WILL BREAK ANYWAY
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
I SET UP THE TYPE I PRINTED IT OUT ON AN EPSON PRINTER WITH WATER SOLUBLE INK TAPED IT TO
AND THAT INFORMATION WILL GO INTO ASKNATURE
AND THEY'RE HAVING APPLIANCES IN YOUR HOME TALK TO ONE ANOTHER THROUGH THAT ALGORITHM AND
NONE OF THESE ARE USING THE ORGANISMS
IT WAS SO ARCHITECTURAL
IT'S KIND OF A FORWARD OSMOSIS
NATURE HAS BEEN DOING THAT FOR A LONG TIME
WHAT COMFORT ARE WORDS TO A WOMAN ON FIRE
EVERY CATCALL IS A BARREL CALLING ME HOME
SO I'M MAKING A LIST OF ALL THE THINGS I WISHED I HAVE SAID
WE ARE HERE TO TALK ABOUT IDEAS
I THINK IDEAS ARE POWERFUL
YOU CAN CONTROL ALL OF THOSE THINGS
THIS IS ROUGHLY PRESENT DAY IRAK
ADAM LOOK LOOK
CHEESE CHEESE AND MORE CHEESE PLEASE
I WANTED TO GET TO THAT POINT
I'M NOT AN AMPUTEE
LOOK AT THIS BROCHURE
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH IT COSTS TO CUT OFF THE REST OF YOUR LEG
WHAT DO YOU WANT ON IT
I'M BRINGING PIZZA
WE WON'T BE AND THAT'S OK
THAT'S THERE COMFORT
I TOLD ADAM WE HAVE TO TELL PEOPLE
IT'S ON RERUN TONIGHT
AND I GO THROUGH THIS AND I SAY TO MYSELF OH MY GOSH
AND IT ALL COMES FLOODING BACK TO ME
MY LEG NEVER GREW BACK
TAKE THE TEMPERATURE OF THE ROOM
4 PERCENT OF THE ENTIRE LAND SURFACE ALREADY PROVIDES FOR 35 PERCENT OF THE
WHILE WE MAY NOT BE SURE ONE THING IS CERTAIN WE WILL NOT WANT THIS PLANT TO DISAPPEAR
IT'S A PLANT
MAYBE I CAN DO THIS ALL THE TIME
AND I APPLAUD THAT
AND WHAT I LEARNED IN SCHOOL THOUGH WAS REALLY BENEFICIAL
AND THEN I REALIZE THE OCTOPUS WON THE ARMS RACE
YEAH I'LL BE A FILMMAKER
INDEED IT'S THE ONLY THING THAT EVER HAS
I THINK MARGARET MEAD SAID IT BEST
DOWN YOU GO
I'VE BEEN TO A PLACE THAT WAS A PRETTY TRASHED BAY
A MAN CAME INTO THE AQUARIUM
IT WAS ALL I COULD DO TO HOLD ONTO THIS AMAZING CREATURE
THEN IT SORT OF CALMED DOWN IN THE PALMS OF MY HANDS AND STARTED FLASHING COLORS JUST PULSING ALL OF THESE COLORS
AND THE AQUARIUM HAD A LOT OF BIG FISH TANKS BUT NOT A LOT OF INVERTEBRATE DISPLAYS AND BEING THE SPINELESS GUY I
PRE CONTACT EATING IS JUST LOCAVORE PALEO ANYONE CAN DO IT
THE GOAL IS TO GET NATIVE AND HOPEFULLY NON NATIVE PEOPLE EXCITED ABOUT FOOD SOVEREIGNTY AND
IT'S NO SECRET THAT YOUR BODY FARES BETTER WHEN YOU AVOID PROCESSED FOODS
IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO HARD AFTER ALL PALEO DIETS ARE ALREADY POPULAR AMONG EVERYONE FROM CROSSFIT BROS TO
JUST WHAT IS TRADITIONAL FOOD ANYWAY
WHAT CLASSIFIES AS PRE CONTACT
FOR FARMING TRIBES THERE WERE THE THREE SISTERS
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE
AND THAT'S THE WORLD I REALLY WANT TO LIVE IN
I WAS THERE
BUT IT'S ALSO VERY SERIOUS BECAUSE ALL THIS ACCESSIBILITY STUFF STARTED COMING UP WHERE PEOPLE CAN'T USE
HOW DID THEY MAKE THEM
WE THINK WE ALREADY KNOW HOW SOMETHING WORKS SO WE CAN'T IMAGINE HOW IT COULD WORK
I RAN THESE WORKSHOPS EVERYWHERE
I CAN'T BE DYSLEXIC AND STUPID
THERE WAS ALMOST NO INTEREST
THAT JUST INSPIRED ME SO MUCH
MY PARENTS WANTED OUT OF ME WHAT ANY TYPICAL PARENT WOULD WANT OUT OF HIS CHILD
AND THE JUDGES WERE JUST SO BLOWN AWAY BY THE FACT THAT A BUNCH OF TEENAGERS COULD GO AND CREATE THINGS CAN
BUT WE QUICKLY REALIZED IT'S NOT THAT EASY
WE DID THIS BECAUSE WE DECIDED TO CREATE THESE RECYCLING
IF SOMEONE WANTED TO DISPOSE OF A PLASTIC WATER BOTTLE FOR INSTANCE AND THERE WAS A TRASH CAN
THROUGH BEING OPEN TO CHANGE WITHIN OURSELVES AS WELL AS CHANGE OUTSIDE OF OURSELVES WE CAN
BUT WHAT DOES THAT DO
SO I'M GOING TO MAKE US HYPER AWARE
BUT WHAT MAKES SOMETHING UNMEMORABLE
SO ONE SECOND FOR ONE SECOND OF COMPUTING
70 PERCENT SUCCESS RATE
WE'RE LIKE THE GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS OF ENTREPRENEURS
BUT BEST OF ALL WE'VE MADE A SMALL DENT A VERY SMALL DENT IN THE WORLDWIDE PLASTIC
I HAD NO ROLE MODELS ABSOLUTELY NONE
THAT'S ALMOST TWICE AS MANY AS WE HAVE TODAY
MY NAME IS VAISHALI
I DIDN'T LIKE IT AT ALL
I WITHDREW FROM THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM
I LEARNT TO KEEP IT INSIDE ME UNTIL I WAS IN MY ROOM ON MY OWN WHERE I COULD ROCK AND I COULD JUMP AND I COULD FLAP MY
AND THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF DEATH IS SUICIDE
I SPENT TEN YEARS IN THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM BOUNCING FROM ONE INPATIENT STAY TO ANOTHER
I'VE LISTENED TO IT EVERY SINGLE NIGHT FOR 15 YEARS AND I KNOW EVERY EPISODE INSIDE OUT
PEOPLE ASSUME THAT HIGH FUNCTIONING MEANS THAT YOUR AUTISM IS MILD WHEN IN FACT HIGH FUNCTIONING
AND THERE'S THIS JOKE THAT WHY DON'T THEY JUST MAKE 10 LOUDER
THE CEMENT LIKE COMPOSITE CAN BE FORMED INTO SEVERAL DIFFERENT SHAPES WHICH RESULTS IN AN EXTREMELY VERSATILE
I HOPE YOU GUYS ENJOY IT
AND THAT'S NOT IT FOR ME
THAT NOTHING WOULD EVER BE THE SAME AFTER THAT MOMENT
COME AT NIGHT
RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU'RE WITH ME
WE GOT HALFWAY THERE AND WORKING WITH ANIMAL WELFARE ORGANIZATIONS WHO POSTED INFORMATION ABOUT MY CAMPAIGN ON THEIR WEBSITES
BUT WHAT REALLY TOUCHED ME THE MOST ABOUT THEM AS I WAS LEARNING ABOUT THEIR BEHAVIOR IS THAT EVEN IN
A THREE METER LONG SHARK A GREAT WHITE SHARK
I REMEMBER THAT DAY
IN THE PAST NINE MONTHS THE QUESTION I'VE BEEN ASKED THE MOST IS WHY
WHY WAS I STICKING MY HEAD ABOVE THE PARAPET
UNLIKE ME THOUGH YOUR BOSS PROBABLY WASN'T THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
A THIRD PARTY APP WHICH SNAPCHATTERS USE TO PRESERVE THE LIFESPAN OF THE MESSAGES WAS
WE'VE SEEN THAT TO BE TRUE WITH RACISM HOMOPHOBIA AND PLENTY OF OTHER BIASES TODAY AND IN THE
OKAY YOU LOVE THIS
TEENAGERS DON'T DRIVE THE WAY THEY USED TO
I DON'T ONLY WANT TO CONSUME THE NUGGETS YOU'VE GIVEN ME IF I'M REALLY INTO THE THING YOU'RE MAKING I WANT TO CONSUME AS MUCH OF IT AS
THIS GAME REPLACES THE SOARING INSPIRATIONAL VIDEO ON HOW DOMINO'S USES ONLY THE FRESHEST
IT JUST DEPENDS
IF YOU TEXT MY MOM RIGHT NOW AND YOU'RE LIKE
THEIR CARE'S THE ENVIRONMENT
BUT IN PRACTICE THEY WANT YOU TO GIVE THEM THE ENTERTAINMENT
I'M NOT GOING TO POSITION THIS THAT WAY AT ALL
WE'VE GOT VOTING IN REALITY TELEVISION
THEY'RE PROVIDING A LOT OF FEEDBACK ON THE LIVE EXPERIENCE
I SAID WHAT'S IT ABOUT
HOW ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO SIT THROUGH TWO HOURS OF NOT INTERACTING
WHAT ARE THE REAL BUSINESS EFFECTS OF THIS
THEY SAID THE RESEARCH CLASSIC MILLENNIAL STUFF
THEY DON'T WANT TO DRIVE A CAR OR SPEND MONEY ON A CAR BUT THE NUMBER ONE REASON WHY DRIVING RATES HAVE FALLEN OFF A
BUT IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT IF YOU'RE 45 YOU STILL WANT CHALLENGING YOU STILL WANT THE CONTENT YOU WANT YOU STILL WANT TO FEEL CONNECTED TO THE
THEY WANT TO COME AND DECIDE THE OUTCOME
WE'RE AT A MOMENT IN TIME IN LIVE PERFORMANCE IN THE CREATION OF CONTENT
HOW I FEEL ABOUT THE THINGS THAT I DO IS VERY IMPORTANT AND I WANT TO KNOW I'M MAKING PROGRESS AND I WANT
HEY GABE'S MOM WHAT ARE YOU DOING
AND THIS IS CORE TO GAMIFICATION
THEY DON'T WANT TO ANYMORE
NOT YOU OKAY NOT YOU BUT YOU
AND ALL THAT IS REALLY CUTE RIGHT
JUST LIKE YOU MAY BE A PART OF A TRIBE IF YOU REALLY LIKE SONDHEIM MUSICALS
AND HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL VERY EFFECTIVE INSTEAD OF FIGHTING WITH IT ROLL WITH IT AND LEVERAGE THAT
THEY WANT TO BE PART OF THAT THOUGH THEY'D LIKE TO BE MORE VISCERALLY INVOLVED
AND GAMIFICATION IS THE PLATFORM WE'LL USE TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN
AND BASICALLY THE WAY THIS GAME IS PLAYED
NOW WE DON'T HAVE DISCIPLINE WE HAVE OCD
ANYTIME YOU CHALLENGE YOURSELF TO SOMETHING ANYTHING NO MATTER HOW BIG OR HOW SMALL AND YOU ACHIEVE THAT THING YOUR
YOU KNOW THAT IN THE UNITED STATES FOUR FIFTHS OF THE POPULATION WATCHED BROADCAST ENTERTAINMENT LIKE A TV SHOW
SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THIS AMAZING GOOGLE GLASS GAME CALLED ZOMBIES RUN
HOW DOES THE LIVE PERFORMANCE INDUSTRY RESPOND TO SOCIAL MEDIA
WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT ROBOTICS
WE CAN'T TREAT HUMANS AS IF WE'RE JUST ONE MONOLITHIC THING
YOU'RE TALKING TOO SOFTLY I'M GOING TO TURN UP YOUR VOLUME WHICH IS LIKE HAVING A COWORKER WALK UP TO YOU AND SAY YOU'RE SPEAKING TOO SOFTLY
HOW ARE DIFFERENT PEOPLE GOING TO GRAPPLE WITH THAT LOSS OF CONTROL
IT'S NOT SO MUCH ABOUT REINVENTING HUMANS IT'S MORE ABOUT FIGURING OUT HOW WE EXTEND OURSELVES RIGHT
SO WHEN HE'D COME VISIT IN PERSON HE NO LONGER STOOD OVER ME AS HE WAS TALKING TO ME HE WOULD SIT DOWN AND TALK TO ME EYE TO
IF THAT ROBOT HAD FIGURED OUT THAT I WAS A PERSON NOT A CHAIR AND THAT I WAS WILLING TO GET OUT OF ITS WAY IF IT WAS
THEY DON'T GET CALLED ROBOT ANYMORE BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY SERVE A PURPOSE IN OUR LIVES
ITS GOAL IS TO MAKE MY HOUSE 66 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT AND IT SENSES THE WORLD
THE AVERAGE PERSON SEES A DOCTOR FOR JUST ABOUT TWO HOURS PER YEAR
THAT COMES OUT TO ABOUT SEVEN DAYS TOTAL OVER THE COURSE OF YOUR ENTIRE LIFETIME
WHEN I WALK BY A FAILING SCHOOL I SEE A BODY COUNT
AND THAT'S CHANGED NOW BECAUSE AS JOURNALISTS WE INTERACT IN REAL TIME
EVERYONE IN THE WORLD HYPOTHETICALLY HAD THE POTENTIAL TO KNOW THAT AN EARTHQUAKE WAS HAPPENING IN MANAGUA
THEY SAID ONE THE BRIDGE DOESN'T EXIST
YOU DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A RE UPLOAD
THEY'RE HELPING US FIND THE NEWS
SO THAT WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT GAVE US A CLUE
AND IN PHOTOS INSTAGRAM 58 PHOTOS ARE UPLOADED TO INSTAGRAM A SECOND
AND THAT'S PART OF THE JOY OF THIS
AND HOW DO YOU BUILD A LIST LIKE THAT FROM SCRATCH
WE'RE NOT IN A POSITION WHERE THE AUDIENCE IS REACTING TO NEWS
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS EVERY MINUTE THERE ARE 72 MORE HOURS OF VIDEO ON YOUTUBE
IT'S ON THE INPUT SIDE
AND THE THIRD ONE SAID I THINK THE BRIDGE DOES EXIST BUT THE DAM UPSTREAM OF THE BRIDGE WAS CLOSED SO
IT'S MUCH QUICKER
SO THAT'S EVERY SECOND MORE THAN AN HOUR OF VIDEO GETS UPLOADED
MORE THAN THREE AND A HALF THOUSAND PHOTOS GO UP ONTO FACEBOOK
IT'S SOMEWHERE ELSE
THEY COULDN'T REALLY CONNECT
ALTHOUGH THE WEB IS RUNNING LIKE A TORRENT THERE'S SO MUCH INFORMATION THERE THAT IT'S INCREDIBLY HARD TO SIFT AND GETTING
WE FOUND THEM IN PENNSYLVANIA NEVADA AND FLORIDA
I'VE GOT TO GO BACK NOW TO MY THREE SOURCES AND LOOK AT WHAT THEY TOLD ME THE ONE WHO SAID THE BRIDGE DIDN'T EXIST THE ONE WHO SAID THE
SO WE WENT AND WE LOOKED FOR A SECOND FREE INTERNET TOOL CALLED WOLFRAM ALPHA AND WE CHECKED THE WEATHER REPORTS FOR THE DAY IN WHICH THIS VIDEO
IT'S CONCERN WITH HOW WE GET INFORMATION AND HOW WE GATHER THE NEWS
THEY'RE HELPING US FIGURE OUT WHAT IS THE BEST ANGLE TO TAKE AND WHAT IS THE STUFF THAT THEY WANT TO HEAR
SO IT'S A REAL TIME THING
ANOTHER ONE SAID THE BRIDGE DOES EXIST BUT IT'S NOT IN HAMA
AND NOWHERE WAS THIS BROUGHT HOME MORE THAN DURING HURRICANE SANDY
YOU DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A SCRAPE
WE HAVE FREE INTERNET TOOLS THAT ALLOW US HELP US DO THIS KIND OF INVESTIGATION
IT TOOK THAT LONG FOR ANYONE TO HAVE ANY IMPACT AND GET SOME FEEDBACK
AND WE DIDN'T KNOW IF RITA EXISTED OR IF IT WAS A FAKE NAME
BUT WE STARTED LOOKING AND WE USED FREE INTERNET TOOLS TO DO SO
TRUTH IS A VALUE
THREE DIFFERENT SOURCES SAID THREE DIFFERENT THINGS ABOUT THE BRIDGE
AND YOU HAVE TO DO THAT INVESTIGATIVE WORK
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS WHEN YOU HAVE THAT MUCH INFORMATION YOU HAVE TO FIND THE GOOD STUFF AND THAT CAN BE INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT WHEN
WHOEVER INSPIRES YOU THE MOST THE QUESTION IS
BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ME NOT YOU SO ENOUGH ABOUT YOU
IN FACT I BELIEVE TO SOME DEGREE ALL OF US EXPERIENCED AS A CHILD TIMES WHEN WE WOULD ACTUALLY STEP
I ASSUME SOMEONE TELLS YOU
SO WHY I AM A HUGE FAN OF WEIRDNESS IS IT'S MY DOGMATIC BELIEF IT ALWAYS LEADS US
AND WE ARE ALWAYS SAYING YES OR NO TO IT
SHE'S TALKING ABOUT WEIRDNESS
BECAUSE IF WE'RE NOT WILLING TO EMBRACE DISCOMFORT THAT MEANS I AM ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS
OR WE THINK WE'RE THE ONLY ONE WITH A HOME THAT'S BROKEN BUT WE'RE MEANT TO PRETEND IT'S NOT BROKEN WE
BUT I STARTED TO REALIZE SOMETHING
AS LONG AS I'M WORSHIPING OTHER PEOPLE'S APPROVAL I CAN NEVER ACCEPT MYSELF
YOU CAN THINK OF THE CLICHE EXAMPLES LIKE ELON MUSK RICHARD BRANSON STEVE JOBS
AND I LIKE DOING THAT
IT INFECTS A LOT OF PEOPLE
HOW WOULD YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE A DOCTOR
IT WAS UNCONVENTIONAL BUT IT WORKED
HERE IS ONE OF THEM SHOWN
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF US DO AND THAT IS TO STEP
I SOUGHT TO START THE FIRST HIGH SCHOOL CHAPTER
THERE ARE 7
BUT BEFORE WE GET INTO THAT LET'S BACK UP A BIT
IT IS NOT ONE OF THOSE CONCEPTS IN LIFE THAT APPLIES TO MOST OF US OR 99 OF
YOU CAN RINSE AND REPEAT WHICH IS TO DO THE SAME EXACT THING OVER AGAIN AND EXPECT
AND HIS NAME IS KENDRICK LAMAR
LET US COME BACK TO N
I'M THE MOST MYSELF I'M 100 MYSELF WHEN I'M RAPPING AND I'M NOT A FAKE
MY QUESTION LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
AND IF YOU DON'T THINK SO GO VISIT THE SEAPORT
VERY COUNTER INTUITIVE
FREE LIKE SIDEWALKS FREE LIKE LIGHTING IN THE STREET PART OF THE PUBLIC REALM
ARGUABLY VEGETARIANS MIGHT EAT THIS
YOU'VE GONE THROUGH THESE LOOPS
SO WAIT A MINUTE
WHY DOES IT WORK
TRANSPARENT AND SO CALLED AUTHENTIC
AND THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE USING COOKIES
THERE ARE SO MANY EASY THINGS TO DO AND I REALLY THINK YOU SHOULD DO IT NOW BEFORE YOU GET REALLY RICH AND
THAT'S WHAT HE IS WORKING AT
AND CHILDREN ARE USED TO THAT
I THINK IT'S A TOO HIGH A PRICE TO PAY FOR YOUR PRIVACY AND BEING YOURSELF
BUT ALL OF US ARE ALWAYS DRIVING A BIT TOO FAST
BUT HOPEFULLY THERE WILL BE OTHERS THAN THE TRACKERS THEMSELVES
AND YOU PROBABLY TOLD THAT ON FACEBOOK
WHY NOT DO THAT
I MEAN YOU PUT IT ON YOUR FRONT DOOR
AND THAT'S BECAUSE I'M NOT PROFESSIONAL THERE
YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD ABOUT BIG DATA IT'S A BUZZWORD THESE DAYS
AND THAT'S WHAT BIG DATA CAN DO
YOU TELL FACEBOOK WHERE YOU TOOK IT AND WHO TOOK IT
HOW DID I DO IT
KNOWLEDGE BECOMES A WEIGHT UPON WISDOM
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S HONEST
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S TRUTHFUL
WE NEED FOOD TO EAT
WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES OR WHO NEED ASSISTANCE IN THERE
THEY DROP OUT OF SCHOOL OR THEY OPT OUT OF LIFE ALTOGETHER
HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THESE
AND MEANWHILE OUR TRANS CHILDREN SUFFER
HOW MANY OF US STILL FEEL SHY OR AFRAID TO DISROBE IN FRONT
WHAT ABOUT ANYONE WITH BODY IMAGE STUFF GOING ON
SHE WAS FOUR YEARS OLD
WHAT ABOUT FOLKS WITH BODIES WHO FOR WHATEVER REASON DON'T FIT INTO THE MAINSTREAM IDEA
I'M TALKING ABOUT COWBOY BOOTS AND CATERPILLAR YELLOW TOY TRUCKS AND BUG JARS THE WHOLE NINE
ONE TIME I ASKED HER WHAT HER FAVORITE COLOR WAS
THEY TRY TO LEGISLATE TO TRY AND FORCE PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF TO USE THE BATHROOM THAT THEY DEEM
AND THIS IS A GREAT AND NECESSARY THING BUT MOST OF THAT ATTENTION HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON A VERY FEW
I'VE OFTEN BEEN VERBALLY ATTACKED BEHIND THEIR DOORS
I'VE BEEN HAULED OUT BY SECURITY GUARDS WITH MY PANTS STILL HALFWAY PULLED UP
I WANT TO YOU TO MEET DIXIE
SHE BELONGS TO MY FOUR YEAR OLD SON ROAN
I HOPE I DIDN'T FAIL
THEY ARE THROWING IT UP IN THE AIR
THERE ARE NO MODELS FOR THEM
2011 THE HUNDRED MOST POPULAR MOVIES
BUT THERE IS A NUMBER THAT IS GREATER THAN THIS THAT'S GOING TO BRING THIS ROOM
BUT MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE OF THE LATTER ONE
MAYBE THERE'S A PROBLEM
I'M A MAINE BOY I'M A MAINE BOY AND IT WAS WEIRD TO MOVE TO LA
IT'S THE SAME MOTIVATION
EVEN THOUGH I HAD MET P
IT WAS WEIRD BECAUSE YOU KNOW LA IS THE PLASTIC SURGERY CAPITAL OF THE COUNTRY
I WANT YOU TO STAY THERE
WE JUST LABEL IT SOMETHING DIFFERENT
IT'S OK IF THEY'RE LOOKING AT YOU
I'M LIKE I HEAR YOU BROTHER I HEAR YOU
MY MOTHER HAD A FIT
THEY GET THOSE THINGS MIXED UP
THAT I WAS THE ONLY ONE
AND YOU GO MY GOD IT'S REALLY FAR AWAY AND IT'S A GIANT WATERFALL
AND YOUR BODY SOMEHOW KNOWS THAT
ONE DAY A YOUNG BOY COMES UPON THE SUNFLOWER WHILE VISITING THE GARDEN AND HE NOTICES HOW WEAK IT LOOKS
JUST LIKE REACHING OUT TO THE SUNFLOWER BY PROVIDING SOMEONE WHO IS NEGLECTED ISOLATED OR FORGOTTEN
THEY ARE INCREDIBLE YET SO OFTEN THEY ARE FORGOTTEN LACKING THE LOVE AND APPRECIATION THEY DESERVE
SO I'VE BEEN TALKING COURSES
ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO ENSURE THAT WE WILL HAVE THE FOOD SUPPLIES AND THE AIR THAT WE NEED IS TO BRING WITH US
WHILE MARS AND ALL THE MOVIES MADE IN ITS NAME HAVE REINVIGORATED THE ETHOS FOR SPACE TRAVEL
VERY EXPENSIVE THEY SOLD THEM OUT FOR MONEY THEN CUTTING TREES AGAIN
SO I REMEMBER IT WAS SO DISAPPOINTING
IN ONE MONTH WE COMPLETED 9 CLASSROOMS OVER 500 SQUARE METERS
AND I WAS VERY LUCKY
HE SAID AS LONG AS YOU BRING YOUR MONEY YOU CAN DO IT
I BROUGHT MY JAPANESE STUDENTS TO WORK WITH THE CHINESE STUDENTS
AND THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING PHOTO
WE CAN MAKE IT BETTER
AFTER THE BUILDING WAS RECYCLED
THOSE ARE INVISIBLE
EVERYTHING IS CONTEXT
IN THE NEXT MOMENT I RECOGNIZED THAT THIS THIRD GRADER WAS FROM A SPANISH SPEAKING FAMILY
REFERENTS IN REFERENCE TO USING PRONOUNS BUT FOR NOW HER INVENTION WAS
DID IT HURT
AND WHERE I WAS BAD WAS ALGEBRA
AND WHEN THE PILOTS WALK AROUND THE PLANE GUESS WHAT
THAT'S THE KIND OF SPECIFICITY YOU NEED
YOU JUST HAVE TO LEARN IT
IT'S LITERALLY MOVIES IN YOUR HEAD
AND I WAS NEVER ALLOWED TO TAKE GEOMETRY OR TRIG
I WAS A GOOFBALL STUDENT WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL
YOU COULD HAVE A HORSE THAT'S BEEN ABUSED BY A RIDER
YEAH I'M A MILLION MILE FLIER
I MEAN ART WAS MY BEST SUBJECT IN SCHOOL
WE NEED TO BE DOING THAT
THEY CAN'T SEE THAT STUFF INSIDE THE TAIL
WELL THAT'S THE END OF MY TALK
YOU KNOW THE SLAUGHTER PLANTS I WORKED WITH IN THE 80S THEY WERE ABSOLUTELY AWFUL
THEY FLASH UP INTO MY MEMORY JUST LIKE GOOGLE FOR PICTURES
THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH INFORMATION THERE IS ON THE LOCAL FIRE HYDRANT
WELL IF YOU'RE BUILDING A BRIDGE DETAILS ARE PRETTY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'LL FALL DOWN IF YOU IGNORE THE DETAILS
AND THAT'S SHOWN VERY VERY NICELY IN THE MOVIE
THAT WOULD NOT BE A REASONABLE THING FOR THEM TO DO
SO I SETTLED ON A WORLDWIDE JOURNEY TRAVELING AROUND THE WORLD LOOKING FOR ANSWERS
SO I GOT IN CONTACT WITH THOMAS
FOR ME IT SEEMED PRETTY EVIDENT WHERE I WAS GOING TO GO
SHE WAS SELF FASTING
SO WHAT'S IN THAT 90
AND TODAY I'M GOING TO SHARE WITH YOU MY JOURNEY
THOMAS SAID YOU KNOW WHAT
SO WHEN IT CAME TO HER DIET PLEASE SHARE WITH ME
HE TOLD ME THAT THERE WERE A COUPLE OF FACTORS HERE WHEN HE WAS FEEDING MAGGIE
WHAT'S EVEN MORE IMPORTANT IS THAT WE SEE A LOWER INCIDENCE OF CANCER IN THESE ANIMALS
AND THEY WANT TO GIVE THEM A SECOND CHANCE
HE SAID SOME DAYS THE DOG WOULDN'T EAT
I WENT TO WHERE ONE OF THE OLDEST DOGS IN THE WORLD WAS EATING
AND HE LAUGHED AT ME
I KNEW I NEEDED TO DO EVERYTHING I COULD IN MY POWER TO FIGURE OUT HOW AND WHY THIS
THAT WAS UNTIL HE GOT A PUPPY
I EVEN COME UP WITH AN EQUATION FOR THIS JUST TO TELL HOW AWESOME THEY ARE
IF WE WANT TO DIG DEEPER INTO THAT 90 LET'S REMOVE THE 10 FOR A SECOND YOU CAN'T CHANGE YOUR DOG'S GENES IF YOU WENT AND ADOPTED YOUR
SOME PEOPLE MAY SAY I DON'T KNOW THAT WAS VERY CONFUSING I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO ALL THAT
SO THE BEST THE CHEAPEST WE CAN DO FOR RAW DNA SYNTHESIS IS ON THE ORDER OF 100 TO 200 BASE
BUT WE HAVE VARIOUS TOOLS YOU'VE SEEN SOME ALREADY NOT IN JUST MY TALK IN OTHERS WHERE CAN TEST
BUT THAT DOESN'T EXCUSE YOURSELF FROM TRYING
I'M GLAD YOU GOT THAT
I MENTIONED I DO SOME TRAINING PROGRAMS AND AS PART OF THAT TRAINING I WOULD TYPICALLY
WE BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE BOTH WITHIN YOU
I THINK I'M WORKING FOR AN IDIOT
THE ONLY TRICK IS WE HAVE TO USE AN N FOR INTUITION BECAUSE WE'VE ALREADY USED THE I UP FOR
SO TRY CROSSING THEM IN THE OTHER WAY
YOU PROBABLY HAVE ALREADY FIGURED IT OUT
I CAN ASSURE YOU WE'RE ALL JUST FINE TODAY
THIS HAND REPRESENTS COMPLETING THE PROJECT
IT'S A COMPLIMENT
INTERRUPTIONS FOR EXTROVERTS ACTUALLY MAY BE COMPLIMENTS
OUR MEMORIES ARE JUST FINE
THEY HAVE NO SENSE OF STANDARDS AND WHAT IS GOOD WORK
SOMEONE CAME UP WITH THEM FOR ME
SO PERSONALITY TYPE HAS BEEN ENOURMOUSLY HELPFUL TO ME IN UNDERSTANDING MYSELF AND OTHERS
THEY BECOME AWARE OF HOW IS THIS GOING TO IMPACT PEOPLE
IF YOU JUST DO EVERYTHING ACCORDING TO YOUR PREFERENCES IT'S NOT GOING TO ALWAYS WORK
ARE THEY LISTENING TO ME
SO YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE GO TO A CHINESE RESTAURANT
YOURS IS GOING TO BE THE MYERS BRIGGS
NOW I THINK IT'S HELPFUL TO KNOW ABOUT PERSONALITY TYPE FOR TWO REASONS
THERE'S A LOT MORE TO IT THAN I'M GOING TO GET TO TODAY
JUST TRY THAT WITH ME IF YOU WOULD OKAY
YOU HAVE A NATURAL PREFERENCE FOR HOW YOU CROSS YOUR ARMS
BUT SUDDENLY WITH PERSONALITY TYPE SHE HAD A FRAMEWORK TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS HAPPENING
THEY JUST DO IT IN DIFFERENT WAYS
NEVER EVER GIVE UP
THESE ARE CONFIDENTIAL PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE COUNSELING THAT PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT
WHAT'S THAT MARIJUANA DOING FOR HIM
IT'S ABOUT SAYING
WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS USE SOME EXAMPLES TODAY FROM THE MARTIAL ART OF KI AIKIDO TO GIVE YOU AN
I CAN MAKE THE POINT VERY SIMPLY BY TALKING ABOUT YOUR DAILY LIFE EXPERIENCE
DO YOU KNOW WHY
OK WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE
I HAD THAT EXPERIENCE
HOW MANY PEOPLE DOES IT TAKE TO HAVE AN ARGUMENT
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS DESERVES SOME ATTENTION HERE
HOLD OUT YOUR HAND AS TIGHT AS YOU CAN
BY THE WAY IT IS THE SAME FOR ALL OF US
READY FOR THIS ONE
HOW ABOUT THIS
I'LL GIVE YOU AN IMAGE TO MAKE THAT MORE CLEAR
THAT'S THE PROBLEM
STUCKNESS IS HARD WIRED IN US
AND YOUR WHOLE WORLD CHANGES
EVEN THOUGH WE TEND TO BE IN THE HABIT OF SEPARATING OUR MIND AND BODY I CAN SHARE WITH YOU A
KEEP ONE POINT
HOW MANY OF YOU ARE THINKING RIGHT NOW ABOUT YOUR HEART BEATING
JUST STICK IT OUT LIKE THAT
I'M GOING TO ASK DEREK TO CONCENTRATE ON THE PHYSIOLOGICAL CENTER OF HIS BODY
HOW ABOUT THIS IN ATHLETICS
THAT IS WHAT DEREK DID WHEN HE WALKED RIGHT INTO MY HAND
AND ONE OF THOSE ADDICTIONS IS THE HABIT OF SEPARATING YOUR MIND AND BODY TOGETHER
THAT IS MY GOAL TODAY BUT WHAT I WILL DO IS TRY TO GIVE YOU SOME TOOLS
ANYWAY THAT'S MY GOAL
AT HOME SHOULDN'T WE BE THE BEST WE CAN BE WITH OUR LOVED ONES
I WILL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE
I AM GOING TO TRY AND RESIST WITH MY BODY
SO WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS
I WOULD PROPOSE TO YOU NOT ONLY IS YOUR MIND AND BODY ONE BUT YOU ARE ONE WITH THE UNIVERSE
THE EXPERTS SAY ABOUT 30 DAYS
SO GUESS WHAT YOU NOW KNOW THOSE CONDITIONS WHERE YOU'RE NOT OPERATING TO THE BEST OF YOUR ABILITY
HOW ABOUT THIS
YOU KNOW WHY
YOU JUST DO NOT PAY ATTENTION TO IT
THIS IS A NATIONAL SECURITY PROBLEM
YOU'RE IN A BAD NEIGHBORHOOD
THEY SAID THEY WOULD FIX IT THEN TURN IT BACK ON
SOME PEOPLE CALLED HIM A MORON
YOU'RE LOCKED OUT OF YOUR CAR
IT'S 11 O'CLOCK AT NIGHT
IT'S THE EROSION OF GRANITE ROCK
THE DARK AREAS ARE LAVA FLOWS
SO FROM THAT POINT THERE WAS A FIT OF OPOSSUM FEVER
WE WERE JUST GETTING AROUND TO POLISHING OFF THESE LAST WILD PREDATORS
SO EVERY YEAR THEY ARE AT THE MERCY OF THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE AND FARMERS ARE LEFT TO
AND WE HAVE GOT TO HELP THEM DO THEIR JOBS AND SERVE THE NEXT GENERATION MORE EFFECTIVELY
AND GUESS WHAT
THEN YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE OWNER OF THAT FARM AND YOU HAVE TO BEG THEM TO WADE WITH
WHICH IS VERY FAR FROM A SUPER MAJORITY RIGHT
WHEN MANY OF US IN THIS ROOM PROBABLY REALIZE THAT IN A LOT OF REGIONS 300000
LIFE HAS BEEN REALLY TOUGH FOR A LOT OF FARM FAMILIES
AND OPPORTUNITY OUTSIDE OF THE FARM HAS ONLY GROWN
BUT NONE OF THEM FARMED
WE ALL KNOW YOU CAN'T TAKE THE SQUARE ROOT OF A NEGATIVE
COULD THERE BE A LESSON THERE FOR US
HE CAME FROM MEXICO
THAT'S A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF TIME
WITH YEARS OF EXPERIENCE GROWING OYSTER PEARLS AND WITH MY KNOWLEDGE OF GROWING CONCH WE SET OUT TOGETHER
GEMOLOGISTS EVERYWHERE WERE SO EXCITED BY THIS BREAKTHROUGH
BUT REALLY THIS WAS A DROP IN THE BUCKET
I JUST LOVED IT SO DEARLY I WANTED TO PROTECT IT FOREVER
WELL A CONCH FARMER CULTIVATING THE SEA LIKE THE FARMER TILLS THE LAND
THAT'S RIGHT LESS THAN 1
I SOMEHOW MADE MY WAY BACK TO THE LOCKER ROOM AND I CALLED MY TEACHER
I DON'T KNOW WHEN THE NEXT RELAPSE IS COMING OR WHAT IT'S GOING TO DO TO ME
IN FACT IT WAS PRETTY MUCH THE OPPOSITE
CLINICAL RESEARCH IS UNDERFUNDED TIME CONSUMING AND
WELL MS IS SORT OF THE SAME SITUATION
THEN I DECIDED TO PUT MY KNOWLEDGE TO USE IN THE BEST WAY A GRADUATE STUDENT KNOWS HOW
IT'S A LOT TO TAKE IN
WHEN THIS HAPPENS YOU HAVE A FEW CHOICES
AM I GOING TO END UP IN A WHEELCHAIR
MY HOSPITAL ADMISSION WAS FULL OF SPINAL TAPS AND MRI SCANS IV INFUSIONS AND
NOTE THE ABSENCE OF DEEP TENDON REFLEXES I EXCLAIMED AS SHE UNSUCCESSFULLY TAPED ON MY KNEES WITH THE REFLEX
I DON'T KNOW IF TOMORROW IS GOING TO BE A GOOD DAY OR A BAD ONE
I NEVER KNOW WHAT'S AROUND THE CORNER
I'M NOT HAVING A RELAPSE RIGHT NOW BUT THE MS VERSION OF REMISSION IS DIFFERENT THAN YOU MIGHT THINK
BY TAKING AN EXAM
AM I GOING TO DIE FROM THIS
MAYBE EVEN USE IT TO MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE
CUT THE AMOUNT OF TIME AND MONEY THAT IT TAKES TO RUN A STUDY
SHE WASN'T PARTICULARLY GOOD AT IT WHICH I ACCEPTED AS A PERSONAL CHALLENGE BECAUSE NEUROLOGY IS MY PASSION
A LESION COULD POP UP IN THE SPEECH CENTER OF YOUR BRAIN CAUSING YOU TO TALK FUNNY
IN ADDITION TO THE VARIETY OF SYMPTOMS THERE'RE ALSO A FEW DIFFERENT TYPES OF MS
RECOVERY FROM A RELAPSE IS NOT GUARANTEED AND THERE'S NO WAY TO KNOW WITH CERTAINTY WHETHER A LOSS OF FUNCTION IS
MY MISSION IS TO EDUCATE EMPOWER AND HELP WORK TOWARDS A DAY WHEN A YOUNG
IT'S THEN AT THAT POINT UNABLE TO SEE STRAIGHT USE MY DOMINANT HAND OR FEEL THREE QUARTERS OF MY BODY THAT EVEN
I BRUSHED IT OFF HOPING THAT IT WAS JUST A SPORTS INJURY
MAYBE I HAD PINCHED A NERVE WHILE WEIGHTLIFTING
MAYBE EVEN GET US TOWARDS A CURE FASTER
I WAS FINALLY GIVING ANESTHESIA FOR THE FIRST TIME AS A STUDENT
WE'RE HOPING THAT BY CROWDSOURCING A HUGE DATA BANK THAT RESEARCHERS CAN TAP INTO
AND THAT'S HOW I BECAME A BOARD CERTIFIED MS NURSE JUST SIX MONTHS AFTER BEING DIAGNOSED WITH
BECAUSE THE CORES ARE DIFFERENT SIZES
NOW THESE CLUSTERS ARE IMPORTANT
NOW WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT
I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY FACEBOOKS EVERYBODY DOES
WITH THAT IN MIND ALL OF YOU CAN THINK ABOUT THAT
IT'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT
THEY ARE ALL THE SAME PARTICLES BUT WHY DO THEY EMIT DIFFERENT LIGHT
I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER ALL OF THAT
BUT IF YOU BREAK IT UP YOU HAVE A LITTLE PIECE
IT'S THE SAME THING
I STUDIED THIS PEPTIDE FOR TWO YEARS
IT'S SOMETHING WHICH EVERYBODY WHO'S INVOLVED WITH IT DEVELOPS AND PASSES ON AS THEY WORK WITH IT
YOU KNOW IT'S A KIND OF NICE IDEA BUT WHAT DO THEY ACTUALLY DO ON THE GROUND
THERE IS NO GREAT CENTRAL ORGANIZATION THAT PUSHES THIS PEOPLE JUST PICK UP AN IDEA AND THEY RUN WITH IT AND THEY IMPLEMENT IT WHERE THEY
AND ALSO STARTING TO PLAY AROUND WITH THE IDEA OF ALTERNATIVE CURRENCIES
BUT THE WORLD ISN'T SECOND LIFE
WE NEED LOCAL GOVERNMENT RESPONSES
AND I THINK IT'S A MORE USEFUL CONCEPT THAN SUSTAINABILITY AS I SAID
IT TRIES TO CREATE A SENSE THAT THIS IS A HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOMETHING REALLY EXTRAORDINARY
BUT ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE GOING TO BE MUCH EASIER IF WE HAVE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE VIBRANT AND COMING UP WITH IDEAS AND LEADING
AND HOW CAN WE EMBRACE THAT AND ACTUALLY COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT WAS ACTUALLY MORE LIKELY TO SUSTAIN EVERYBODY
WE NEED NATIONAL RESPONSES
IT LEARNS VERY MUCH FROM ITS MISTAKES
AND IT FEELS HISTORIC
AND IT IS SOMETHING WHICH HAS SEVERAL CHARACTERISTICS
AND AS WE SIT EXCHANGING FREE IDEAS WITH EACH OTHER THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE MINING COAL IN ORDER TO POWER THE
ALREADY THAT'S FALLEN TO ABOUT 11
AND THAT'S WHY NOW THE NEW BREAKTHROUGHS THE NEW FRONTIERS IN TERMS OF OIL EXTRACTION ARE SCRAMBLING ABOUT IN
SO THE IPCC SAID THAT WE MIGHT SEE SIGNIFICANT BREAKUP OF THE ARCTIC ICE IN 2100 IN THEIR WORST
ED MILIBAND THE ENERGY MINISTER OF THIS COUNTRY WAS INVITED TO COME TO OUR RECENT CONFERENCE AS A KEYNOTE
LET'S DO IT BECAUSE THEN I CAN TAKE THAT AND DO SOMETHING ELSE
SO THANK YOU GUYS FOR YOUR TIME I REALLY APPRECIATE IT
WELL QVC TOOK A BIG DIVE AND THEY ARE LIKE WHY AREN'T THESE PEOPLE SELLING THEIR PRODUCTS
YOUR JOBS APPLICATIONS ARE NOT PRINTED OFF THIS IS WHAT MIKE ROWE DOES
IF YOU ARE DOING YOUR JOB AND IF YOU LOVE IT WE ARE GOING TO MAKE YOU SUCCESSFUL
AND THAT WAS MY FIRST TIME TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH THAT
IN 1947 THE EDINBURGH FESTIVAL WAS BORN AND AVIGNON WAS BORN AND HUNDREDS OF OTHERS WOULD
FESTIVALS PROMOTE DIVERSITY THEY BRING NEIGHBORS INTO DIALOGUE THEY INCREASE
I MEAN I'D THOUGHT ABOUT THE HARBOUR BRIDGE OR BONDI BEACH BUT MINTO
WE TRAVERSE TIME AND SPACE THROUGH CLOTHING
THEY WOULD ARREST PEOPLE FROM THE RAILROAD PLATFORMS
AND GOT THE CHANCE TO RECORD THIS MUSIC THIS NEW MUSIC THAT THEY WERE CREATING AND TO SPREAD IT
WE MIGHT NOT KNOW DIANA ROSS' NAME HAD THERE BEEN NO GREAT MIGRATION
ONE WAS THE MIGRATION ALONG THE EAST COAST FROM FLORIDA
AND WHEN THEY REALLY WANTED TO GET AWAY THEY WENT TO SEATTLE
THEY WERE SHARECROPPERS AND NOT EVEN BEING PAID
WE'VE SEEN THAT IT CAN AFFECT MATTER AND CAUSE FORM WITHIN MATTER
WE CAN INSPIRE EACH OTHER
THEY HAVE PERMANENTLY ALTERED THEIR GUT FLORA
WE HAVEN'T HAD SEX IN SIX WEEKS
I HAD A GREAT ORGASM
IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF A BREAKTHROUGH FOR THEM
HE NEEDS TO RECOGNIZE THAT THOSE THINGS WILL TURN HER ON
SEX IS A POWERFUL WAY OF CONNECTING AND BONDING WITH SOMEBODY YOU LOVE
THE THIRD STAGE
WE ENJOYED EACH OTHER
THE FIRST IS DESIRE
I'M NOT TRYING TO BE FUNNY
I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT THE COUPLES IN MY PRACTICE
WOMEN DO NOT HAVE A CORNER ON THE LOW LIBIDO MARKET
AND SHE PROMISED SHE WOULD DO BETTER
THAT WAS MY MOMENT OF SEEING WHAT WAS REALLY GOING ON
WHO'S GETTING THE NOBEL PRIZE
WE'RE ALL VERY HASTY WE HAVE LITTLE TIME WE HAVE TO PUBLISH
ARE THERE MORE DANGEROUS VIRUSES COMING OUT
DON'T THEY KNOW WHERE THESE BIG PROBLEMS ARE
BECAUSE THEY NEED THEM TO SURVIVE
HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHO GETS THE MONEY
AND THEN OF COURSE THERE'S A PROBLEM
WE'RE SPENDING TOO LITTLE TIME ON QUALITY CONTROL
WHAT SHOULD WE DO
THE GUYS FORM ACT UP REALLY WENT TO THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH AND WALKED INTO OUR LABORATORIES TO
AND THEY WERE IN THE STREETS YOU CAN SEE IT IN THE SLIDES BEHIND ME SAYING
WE REALLY WANT THAT INFORMATION
SCIENCE HAS GROWN
THIS IS THE WAY TO SURVIVE IN SCIENCE
WE DIDN'T KNOW
YOU GUYS HAVE TO ACT UP YOU HAVE TO FIGHT THE DISEASE NOT EACH OTHER
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THESE LABORATORIES
AND OF COURSE WE SHOULD REWARD ACADEMICS INVESTIGATORS FOR PICKING UP THE
POLITICAL SCIENTIST VICTOR ASAL AND COLLEAGUES HAVE LOOKED AT SEVERAL FACTORS THAT SHAPE A POLITICAL GROUP'S
12 ZODIAC SIGNS
IF WE COULD REDUCE THE USAGE OF PAPER TOWELS ONE PAPER TOWEL PER PERSON PER
SHE WALKS OVER TO ME VERY SLOW AND SULKY LIKE SHE'S LATE FOR SCHOOL FOR THE LAST TIME
SHE SAID WELL IT'S THIS PERIOD IN TIME WHEN PEOPLE WITH SKIN COLOR LIKE YOURS HAD TO DO THINGS AGAINST THEIR WILL
I SAID GRANDMA I LOVE THE MOUNTAINS
SO I STARTED TO WONDER HOW MANY PEOPLE DID THIS WOMAN SET FREE
WE LAUGHED LIKE KIDS LAUGH AT THAT POINT IN TIME
IN 1995 ON A FAMILY VACATION I WENT TO VISIT THIS PLACE FOR THE FIRST TIME
SHE SAID WHAT JOVAN
DO YOU LOVE THE OCEANS
ANSWER THE QUESTION
SHE SAID FIRST OF ALL YOU CAN'T BE THROWING YOUR BACKPACK AT YOUR FATHER LIKE THAT
DO YOU LOVE THE RIVERS
AND EVERY BIT OF BLACK BOY BUOYANCY CAME STORMING BACK INTO MY CHEST
I WAS TAUGHT THIS BY MY GRANDMOTHER MARILEE ROBERTS MAYS
WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE PART OF NATURE
FOR THE NEXT 40 MINUTES I SAT IN THE BACK OF CLASS WHILE THE REST OF MY CLASSMATES FOUND THEIR EUREKA
KATE DEPUTY STEPPED UP AND TALKED ABOUT THE DUTCH ROYALTY IN HER FAMILY
HOW MANY DOORS DID YOU LEAVE OPEN
MEANWHILE MY TEACHER MISS CHAMBERS THE LADY WHO TAUGHT ME POETRY AND HOW TO COUNTRY TWO
I'M SO THANKFUL FOR MY GRANDMOTHER AND THE LESSONS THAT SHE DAWNED UPON ME
THE VERY NEXT YEAR THIS WOMAN MY GRANDMOTHER DIDN'T WAKE UP OUT OF HER SLEEP IN VIRGINIA BEACH
SHE SAID WHAT
THE VERY NEXT DAY AT SCHOOL WE HAD OUR PRESENTATIONS
FOR MOST BENEFICIARIES THE FOOD STAMP BENEFITS RUN OUT BY THE SECOND OR THIRD WEEK OF
THAT'S THE FIRST THING
BUT IN MANY IMPORTANT WAYS THEY ARE BROKEN THEY ARE OUTDATED AND IT'S TIME TO CHANGE THEM
BUT THERE'S ALSO AN IMPORTANT ROLE FOR THE GOVERNMENT
50 A DAY A BUCK AND A HALF A MEAL
SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE LOST PARENTS PREMATURELY TO THAT CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE EPIDEMIC
WE PROVIDED SOME OF THE SCIETIFIC INPUT AND FACT CHECKING AND SO FORTH AND THIS NOW HAS
BUT JUST A REMINDER
WE HAVE ABOUT 3
SOME OF YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT
YOU VERY RARELY GO TO A PLACE THAT ISN'T ON YOUR PERSONAL MAP
WHAT IS THE PROCESS OF CARTOGRAPHY
THEY LITERALLY PUT NOOSES ON THEMSELVES AND THEN THEY WENT OFF TO THEIR JOBS WHATEVER THEY WERE
AND HE SAID DO YOU REALIZE THAT IF YOU'D WORKED AT BASKIN ROBBINS THOSE SIX HOURS YOU COULD HAVE MADE 30
AND BECAUSE THE YOUTUBE PAGE IS SET UP SO THAT THE PAGE IN WHICH I'M TALKING TO YOU IS ON THE EXACT
THE WAY THAT WE CHOOSE SORT OF OUR PERSONAL CARTOGRAPHIC ENTERPRISE ALSO SHAPES THE
TODAY'S QUESTION IS WHY
SO I WAS A REALLY TERRIBLE STUDENT WHEN I WAS A KID
IT'S TRUE THAT I HAD TEACHERS THAT DIDN'T GIVE UP ON ME AND I WAS VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE THOSE TEACHERS BECAUSE I OFTEN GAVE
IT'S ABOUT CARTOGRAPHY
AND SO I STARTED TO LEARN BECAUSE LEARNING WAS COOL
AND I SAID I DON'T KNOW LIKE SIX HOURS
IT WAS SPOTTY IT WAS INCONSISTENT THERE WAS A LOT I DIDN'T KNOW
SO I HAD ONE LEARNING COMMUNITY IN HIGH SCHOOL THEN I WENT TO ANOTHER FOR COLLEGE AND THEN I WENT TO ANOTHER WHEN I
AND THAT'S WHEN LEARNING REALLY BEGAN FOR ME
THESE PEOPLE IN MY SYMBOL OBSESSED TWELVE YEAR OLD IMAGINATION THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE STRANGLING
THAT'S A TERRIBLE END
BUT THE GREAT THING ABOUT IMAGINING LEARNING AS CARTOGRAPHY INSTEAD OF IMAGINING IT AS ARBITRARY HURDLES THAT YOU HAVE TO JUMP
THEY EXIST IN CORNERS OF THE INTERNET WHERE OLD MEN FEAR TO TREAD
I BELIEVE THAT WHAT WE MAP CHANGES THE LIFE WE LEAD
WE MADE AGLOE NEW YORK UP
IT IS A FAKE PLACE
IT'S A PAPER TOWN
I WAS ALSO A CURIOUS ECONOMICS MAJOR AS AN UNDERGRAD
SO AS I SPENT TIME WITH LEADERS IN THE GNH MOVEMENT I GOT TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE DOING
WE'RE NOT ASKING IMPORTANT QUESTIONS
AND FOCUSED WITH GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT
WE'RE SPENDING 10 BILLION DOLLARS ON THE CENSUS
WE'RE ASKING 10 SIMPLE QUESTIONS IT IS SIMPLICITY
THAT WAS THE FIRST ONE ONLY FOUR TO GO
WHAT DO THEY WANT OR NEED
DON'T RELEASE IT YET
NOW THIS IS THE BEST ONE
IT'S THAT TRANSACTIONAL THING WHERE IT'S LIKE
LOOK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT THE UNEXAMINED LIFE IS NOT WORTH LIVING BUT IF ALL YOU'RE
WHAT DO YOU LOVE TO DO
HOLD IT DON'T RELEASE IT YET
WHAT DO ALL THOSE PEOPLE WANT OR NEED
WHO DO YOU DO IT FOR
HOW DO THEY CHANGE
SO WHEN PEOPLE ASK YOU THIS QUESTION SO WHAT DO YOU DO
IN JUST ONE OR TWO WORDS
ON THE COUNT OF FIVE
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO
NOW WE'RE GOING TO PUT THIS ALL TOGETHER KIND OF IN A SENTENCE OK
ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE
THAT FORMULATION FORCES YOU TO BE OUTWARD FACING
SO SINCE YOU ALL DID SO WELL WE HAVE TIME FOR JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EXTRA CREDIT
YOU'RE GOING TO KNOW YOUR LIFE PURPOSE NOW IN THE NEXT FIVE MINUTES
ON THE COUNT OF FIVE HOW DO THEY CHANGE OR TRANSFORM AS A RESULT OF WHAT YOU GIVE THEM
ONE THEY HAVE TERRIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
SO WE RAN IT AGAIN
AND THAT'S IN THE PATIENTS WHERE THEY DO WORK
IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THAT SURPRISING THEY WERE CAUGHT
AND THOSE TWO THINGS TOGETHER RIGHT ONE OR THE TWO MAY NOT HAVE BEEN THAT IMPORTANT BUT THE TWO TOGETHER MEANT THAT WE HAD TO
5 TRILLION DOLLARS AND SINCE THEY ARE CHRONIC THAT COST IS COMPOUNDING AND IS THEREFORE
SO WE DID WHAT YOU DO IN SCIENCE WHEN YOU'RE NOT SURE AND WE RAN IT AGAIN
IT DIDN'T REALLY LOOK RIGHT TO ME
WE USE IT ON THE BATTLEFIELD
AND LIKE I SAID WE ONLY GAVE A TINY AMOUNT OF THE DRUG AND IT LASTED FOR WEEKS AND THAT'S NOT LIKE ANYTHING YOU
THERE ARE A LOT OF PATIENTS WHERE THESE DRUGS DON'T WORK
A PAINKILLER WILL MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER BUT IS NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING TO TREAT THAT UNDERLYING DISEASE
THEY HAVE TWO OTHER THINGS IN COMMON THAT ARE REALLY IMPORTANT
WHEN DOCTORS FIRST SAW THIS MOOD ENHANCING EFFECT OF IPRONIAZID THEY DIDN'T REALLY RECOGNIZE WHAT THEY
AND MENTAL SET IS ANOTHER THING
THAT'S SORT OF THIS PRECONCEIVED FRAMEWORK WITH WHICH WE APPROACH PROBLEMS
AND THAT PROPELLED BRIDGET TO GO INTO THE PROFESSION OF NURSING
WE LIVE IN A COMPLICATED TIME WHEN IT COMES TO OUR HEALTH CARE
HE TALKED ABOUT HIS EXPERIENCE OF BEING A NURSE IN GERMANY AND TAKING CARE OF THE SOLDIERS COMING RIGHT
WE TALKED ABOUT HER BOYFRIENDS WE TALKED ABOUT LOOKING FOR APARTMENTS IN NEW YORK CITY AND WE TALKED ABOUT MY
NOW AS A NURSE IN THE BRONX SHE HAS A REALLY DIVERSE GROUP OF PATIENTS THAT SHE CARES FOR FROM ALL
I WASN'T GOING TO BE ABLE TO PRETEND ANYMORE AS THOUGH EVERYTHING WAS NORMAL
AND BEFORE WE LEFT SHE WENT INTO THE ROOM OF A DYING PATIENT
YOU'VE ALREADY GIVEN ENOUGH BROTHER
BUT THEN MY CHEMO WAS SCHEDULED TO BEGIN AND THAT TERRIFIED ME BECAUSE I KNEW THAT I WAS GOING TO
I SPENT FIVE YEARS INTERVIEWING PHOTOGRAPHING AND FILMING NURSES FOR A BOOK AND A
I HAD A PORT INSTALLED IN MY CHEST
I WENT TO MY FIRST DAY OF CHEMOTHERAPY AND I WAS AN EMOTIONAL WRECK
JOANNE MADE ME FEEL NORMAL FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SIX MONTHS
THERE IS AN INSTITUTIONAL GAP
I'VE BEEN IN SO MANY COUNTRIES WHERE WOMEN DO 2 3 OF THE WORK FOR 1 3 OF THE
WHERE IS THE INSTITUTIONAL BASIS UPON WHICH WE CAN NOW GOVERN
I NOW HAVE 70 WOMEN WHO WORK FOR ME
IF YOU THINK ABOUT THINGS IN THE UNITED STATES LIKE THE ANTI SOPA MOVEMENT IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE REVOLUTIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST
HE SAID SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY SORT OF LIT THE PATH FOR ME
WHERE IS NELSON MANDELA
YOU KNOW I STARTED THIS COMPANY BECAUSE I BELIEVED THAT WOMEN COULD REALLY THROW THEIR SHOULDERS AND BE
I HOPE ONE DAY TO BE AN OLD MAN
40 OF AMERICA'S GDP IS EQUAL TO 6 TRILLION DOLLARS OF ANNUAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY
EMPOWERING WOMEN ECONOMICALLY AND IN THE SECURITY DOMAIN IS NOT A MORAL ISSUE
I'VE GOT CLIENTS IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE EAST ASIA IN THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
THINK ABOUT THE GOOD FRIDAY ACCORDS IN NORTHERN IRELAND IN 1998
AND YOU KNOW THE SECURITY ENVIRONMENT THERE IT WAS TOUGH
WE THE PEOPLE IN THE WHITE SHIRTS THE RED TIES AND THE PIN STRIPE SUITS IT'S TIME FOR US TO TAKE OVER
AND I THINK THAT OTHER COUNTRIES ARE OUGHT TO DO THE EXACT THING
SHE NOW EMPLOYS 70 OTHER WOMEN
THERE IS A POWER GAP
AND WHAT I WANT TO DO FOR THESE 15 MINUTES WE'LL SHARE 5 THINGS WE'LL SHARE 5
ONE THING THAT'S MUCH MORE TRUE TODAY THAN WAS TRUE 1298
AND THEN LIKE MANY PEOPLE I WAS INSPIRED TO BEGIN A LIFE OF PUBLIC SERVICE
SO THIS YOUNG WOMAN MARIA UMAR STARTED THE WOMEN'S DIGITAL LEAGUE
THEY'RE THE ONES WHO DECIDE IN THIS VILLAGE
WHEN WE MADE THE ART PROJECT A SUCCESS IT WAS BECAUSE WE TOOK TIME TO TALK WITH ALL THE PEOPLE AND GET THE WHOLE
HE WANTED TO PAINT ON THE SAME WALLS WE HAD BEEN WORKING SO HARD TO TRY TO GET RESTORED
AND WE MANAGED TO COLLECT MATERIALS FROM OVER 40 BUILDINGS AND INCORPORATE THEM INTO THE LIBRARY
IS THIS INTERESTING FOR YOU
WE USED TO BE 5000 PEOPLE
BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE'RE RESTORING HOMES THE SYSTEM IS NOT ABOUT EMPOWERING PEOPLE
AND PEOPLE START SHARING STORIES
AND THIS HAS GROWN INTO THE WORK THAT I DO TODAY CALLED VARD RESTORED WHERE WE HAVE OVER 50
THIS WAS MY FAMILY
I STILL STRUGGLE WITH WHAT MORE I CAN DO
THE SVALBARD GLOBAL SEED VAULT IS A WONDERFUL GIFT THAT NORWAY AND OTHERS HAVE GIVEN US BUT IT'S NOT THE COMPLETE
I DON'T KNOW IF WE NAMED THE APPLE OR IF THE APPLE NAMED US BUT
AND THERE ARE A COUPLE OF ANSWERS TO THAT QUESTION
HE WAS THE MOST RESPECTED SCIENTIST IN THE FIELD
AND IN DOING SO WE FORMED A FAMILY
WHILE COLLECTING HIS TONY AWARD ON WORLDWIDE TELEVISION SPEECH WRITER AND PLAYWRIGHT LIN
MUSLIM PEOPLE USUALLY HAVE MUSLIM FAMILIES
OR WILL SOME MAD MAN WITH A GUN RIP IT AWAY FROM ME BECAUSE MY IDENTITY DIFFERS TO THE NORM
IN MOST SCENARIOS MINORITIES THEY HAVE THEIR FAMILY
WE LIVE IN TIMES WHERE HATE AND FEAR SEEM STRONGER
BEFORE I FINISH I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU THE WORDS OF A MAN WHO DID JUST THAT
WE NEED PEOPLE TO ACCEPT US BECAUSE IF EVERY HETEROSEXUAL PERSON WAS PART OF OUR EXTENDED FAMILY
HAMILTON HAS PROVED THAT HISTORY REMEMBERS
BLACK PEOPLE USUALLY HAVE BLACK FAMILIES
SO WE TURN TO OUR LGBT FAMILY
WE ALL CAME TOGETHER AND STOOD AS ONE
IT SCARED ME BECAUSE I LOOK TO THE FUTURE AND I'M EXCITED
I'M EXCITED BECAUSE I WANT A WIFE I WANT A CHILD I WANT A FAMILY
BUT WILL I BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT FAMILY IN PEACE
BUT THIS IS ALSO ABOUT SOMETHING FAR MORE COMPLEX
PUTTING THEM THERE MADE THEM MORE RECOGNIZABLE
A RECENT GLOBAL SURVEY FOUND THAT 73 PERCENT OF THE TOP MEDIA MANAGEMENT JOBS ARE STILL HELD BY MEN
CASE IN POINT
THE GLOBAL MEDIA MONITORING PROJECT HAS FOUND THAT STORIES BY FEMALE REPORTERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO CHALLENGE
AND SHE WORKED WITH AN EDITOR AT NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO TO TRY TO GET A STORY AIRED NATIONALLY
WE DON'T REALLY PUT A GPS IN YOUR DRINK BUT WE WILL GO FOR YOU AGAIN AND AGAIN
AND WE'D BETTER BE RELENTLESS AND DRIVE EACH OTHER CRAZY UNTIL WE GET IT RIGHT
SO WE TRACK THEM AND WE TRACK OURSELVES AND FIGURE OUT IF ANYTHING WE DO IS OF HELP
SHOW UP AT ROCA READY TO PARTICIPATE AND WE WILL SHOW YOU THE DOOR
SOME YOUNG PEOPLE ARE IN SUCH DANGEROUS GANG SITUATIONS THEY CAN'T EVEN COME IN TO PROGRAMMING
OUR LATEST OBSESSION IS TEACHING YOUNG PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR EMOTIONS AND HOW TO MANAGE THEM SO THEY CAN
AND JOE WENT ON TO SAY WHEN I WAS SITTING THERE WAITING FOR MY FRIEND AND I THOUGHT
LAST NIGHT I WAS IN THE PARK WITH MY GIRL AND THIS GUY LOOKED AT ME FROM ACROSS THE PARK
THEY ARE OUR CHILDREN
IF THE EVALUATOR SAYS WE'RE SUCCESSFUL IN FIVE YEARS THEN THE GOVERNMENT PAYS AND THE INVESTORS GET
WHEN HARVARD DUG INTO OUR NUMBERS IT SHOWED THAT THE YOUNG PEOPLE AT ROCA REDUCED RECIDIVISM BY
WE BRUSH OFF THE F YOU S AND FIND THEM EVEN WHEN THEY ARE HIDING FROM US
AND THEN THEY WOULD GO HOME DEAL DRUGS AND SHOOT PEOPLE
THIS WAS NOT THE POINT
THIS BECAME THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF OUR WORK
BUT HOW MANY OF US ARE WILLING TO GIVE SECOND CHANCES
THEY EMIGRATE TO THE UNITED STATES AND SETTLE IN OAKLAND CALIFORNIA
THIS LED ME TO COMMIT A VIOLENT CRIME WHICH CATEGORIZED ME AS A VIOLENT OFFENDER
BUT I'M NOT A VIOLENT PERSON BY NATURE
BECAUSE OUR BEHAVIOR IS A BIG FACTOR IN WHO WE ARE WOULDN'T YOU AGREE
SO PHYSICAL TRAUMA AND PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA HAD DISTINCT EFFECTS ON THE BRAIN
BUT THE SOLDIERS REACTED
LET ME GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THIS NETWORK IT INVOLVES FRONTAL AREAS HIPPOCAMPAL AREAS TEMPORAL LOBE AREAS THAT ARE
THEY COULDN'T GET ANY MORE WOUND UP
THOSE WITH MTBI HAD DIFFERENT PATTERNS ON THE VARIOUS TASKS BUT THEY WERE
I WAS ASKED A QUESTION BY DEFENSE CANADA
IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DIAGNOSED EASILY
WE HAD TWO GROUPS FROM THE MILITARY
AND THEN I MET THIS YOUNG LADY
WE WORKED TOGETHER AS A TEAM
ACHIEVEMENT IS SHARED
AND YET STILL I REMAINED AMAZED THAT SHE WAS SURVIVING
IT GOES TO BITE ME A SECOND TIME
HE WAS BRINGING PEACE TO A DIVIDED AND VIOLENT SOUTH AFRICA ONE MAN
THROUGH THIS ACT OF IMMENSE OPEN HEARTEDNESS HE WAS TO BECOME THE EMBODIMENT OF WHAT IN SOUTH
HE FIXED ROADS HE MENDED WETLANDS HE DID SOME ANTI POACHING
I WILL START WITH A CHEAP VISUAL STUNT TO GRAB YOUR ATTENTION AND COVER THE FACT THAT MY ACT IS
THE STRING HAS BEEN LACERATED
I WOULD EXPLAIN WHY I THINK THIS IS A LOUSY TRICK
I THINK IT'S A LOUSY TRICK BECAUSE AT ITS CORE IT'S JUST A PUZZLE
WELL HONESTLY I DIDN'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION
I DIDN'T WANT MONEY BACK I WANTED BION BACK
I WANTED OUR LIFE BACK
BUT WE DUG IN AND FOUGHT BACK
WELL THEY'RE ALREADY STARTING TALK ABOUT THIS
THE G8 NATIONS HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY GENEROUS ON POLIO OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS BUT WE'RE STARTING TO HAVE
BUT THEY LOCALIZE IT
IT'S A LOT LIKE OTHER CONSUMER COMPANIES
COKE'S GLOBAL CAMPAIGN SLOGAN IS OPEN HAPPINESS
AND I'M HAPPY TO SAY ONLY ONE OTHER PERSON IN THAT AREA GOT POLIO
LET'S LISTEN TO THIS SONG THAT COKE CREATED FOR IT WAVIN' FLAG BY A SOMALI HIP HOP ARTIST
NOW THAT PLAYED ITSELF OUT IN THE WORLD CUP CAMPAIGN
NOW IT COULD HAVE COME FROM ONE OF TWO PLACES
THEY SET THEM UP AS WHAT THEY CALLED MICRO DISTRIBUTION CENTERS AND THOSE LOCAL ENTREPRENEURS THEN HIRE
THEY LEARN SOMETHING THEY PUT IT BACK INTO THE PRODUCT THEY PUT IT BACK INTO THE MARKET
THEY HAVE A WHOLE TEAM CALLED KNOWLEDGE AND INSIGHT
IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF ALL THE PLANNING AND MARKING AND EXTRA STUFF THAT WE DO
AT THE END OF THE CONVERSATION I HAD TO PICK UP MY CUP OF COFFEE THAT I ALWAYS HAVE STEP OUT INTO THE
IN MY LINE OF WORK AS HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER I HEAR VOICES JUST LIKE THAT IN THE HALLWAYS I SEE BULLYING ALL THE TIME
AND WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT
COULD YOU IMAGINE WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE
IT'S A METAPHOR THAT NOT ONLY IMPLIES AVOIDING CONFRONTATION BUT IT ALSO
THE WHOLE SITUATION WAS WHIPPING THROUGH MY MIND SO FAST
MY STUDENTS HAD ALL KINDS OF QUESTIONS FOR ME NOT ABOUT MY PERSONAL LIFE BUT ABOUT GAY HISTORY AND OTHER
SO IN THAT MOMENT WHEN I CAME OUT TO MY STUDENTS IT FELT AS IF A BOMB HAD DROPPED
MY ANXIETY WAS GOING UP
HERE I WAS FACE TO FACE WITH ANOTHER FOOTBALL PLAYER BUT THIS TIME INSTEAD OF KNOCKING ME
KIDS LIKE NOAH WHO SAT FOR OVER AN HOUR IN A MCDONALD'S FEEDING AND TALKING TO A HOMELESS MAN
NOW I WAS THAT TEACHER WHO HAD A CONVERSATION ABOUT BEING GAY WITH HIS CLASS
BUT IT WASN'T A CONVERSATION THAT I EVER PLANNED TO DELIBERATELY HAVE WITH ANY OF MY CLASSES BECAUSE LET'S
THE HIDDEN CURRICULUM I'M TALKING ABOUT IS A TERM THAT DESCRIBES ALL THE CONVERSATIONS
OF ALL THE ASSIGNMENTS THAT I GAVE THAT YOUNG MAN ALL THE ESSAYS HE WROTE THAT MOMENT OF
YOU SEE THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF US DO IN SITUATIONS LIKE THAT
WHERE DO THESE IMPRESSIONS OF TODAY'S YOUNG PEOPLE COME FROM
I COULD BRING THEM OUT HERE
YOU ALL KNOW THE RESPONSE
THAT MOMENT MEANT MORE TO ME THAN A BUILDING FULL OF PEOPLE WEARING PINK SHIRTS AND THOSE PINK
WE HAVE PROGRAMS IN PLACE
YOU START TO FEEL A CONNECTION
SO THE ORDERS COME FROM THE TOP DOWN
YOU START TO FEEL ALIVE
THERE'S A STRANGER AMONG US
AND SO WE STEP OFF THE PLANE
YET YOU COME BACK AND EVERYBODY'S SAYING YOU'RE A HERO
AND YOU CAN DO THAT YOU CAN TWEAK THE VIRUSES SO THEY HIT JUST SOME CELLS AND NOT OTHERS
AND BY TURNING THINGS OFF IT'S MORE OR LESS A ZERO
THE CRY OF RAW DATA NOW
NOW MOST STORIES START OFF WITH
NOW IF THERE'S A TIGER IN FRONT OF YOU YOU'RE REALLY NOT GOING TO BENEFIT THAT MUCH FROM THINKING
MY FIRST THOUGHT IS TO GET THE GIRLS AWAY
I'M REALLY INTO KNOWING WHERE PEOPLE ARE COMING FROM IN THEIR THOUGHTS ACTIONS AND WORDS
HE IS THE ONE THAT EVERYONE LOOKS TO TO SEE WHAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING AND IF THEY LIKE IT OR NOT
AND I NOTICE THAT MADDIE'S SITTING ON THE PORCH WHICH IS OUT OF PLACE
IT ISN'T ALWAYS COME ACROSS EXACTLY IN YOUR DREAMS
I WAS MILKING IT
I DECIDE TO NOT GO TO MY FAVORITE MUSEUM WITH MY FAMILY
WHAT EMDR DOES IS IT REALLY FORCES YOU TO BELIEVE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND THINKING
AND I SUBJECT MYSELF TO THE SAME ANALYSIS
AND THAT'S WHAT THE AMYGDALA TRIGGERS
THE OPERATOR PICKS UP AND I HAVE TO UTTER THE WORDS
AND I'M ALL ALONE
USUALLY I JUST CHAUFFEUR FOR MY SISTER FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE
SHE ASKS CAN WE GO PICK UP MADDIE FROM JASON'S HOUSE
NOW MY SISTER LIKES TO THROW PARTIES LIKE ANY OTHER TEENAGER DOES
I JUST GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL AND I'M RIDING THE EUPHORIA OF ALL THAT COMES ALONG WITH GOING AWAY TO COLLEGE
AND JUST REMEMBER THAT SOMETIMES IT NEEDS A LITTLE HELP
SO CAN WE USE LIGHT
SO THAT'S A BIG CHALLENGE
NOW THE CHALLENGE IS
BUT IS THIS THE ONLY THING
THAT'S THE QUESTION TO ASK
CALL YOUR PARENTS THAT'S WHY THEY BOUGHT THIS FOR YOU
THAT'S HOW AMAZING THESE TECHNOLOGIES HAVE BECOME
I WANT THAT CHECKED
MAYBE CONSCIOUSNESS EXISTS BUT IT CAN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO THE WORLD
BECAUSE WE ARE THE VERY EXISTENCE OF CONSCIOUSNESS
AND I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT ARGUMENT BRIEFLY AND THAT IS
BUT THE SECOND ONE HAD AN INCREDIBLE INFLUENCE AND MAY STILL BE AROUND AND THAT IS
WE ARE NOT READY FOR A SCIENTIFIC DEFINITION BUT HERE IS THE COMMON SENSE DEFINITION
I PROMISED TO REFUTE ALL THESE GUYS BUT I DON'T HAVE AN AWFUL LOT OF TIME LEFT BUT LET ME REFUTE A COUPLE MORE OF THEM
I DON'T THINK THAT FOR A MOMENT
SO IT'S AN OBVIOUS MISTAKE
NOW WITH THAT IN MIND WITH GOING THROUGH THESE VARIOUS FEATURES OF CONSCIOUSNESS LET'S GO
SCIENCE IS OBJECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS IS SUBJECTIVE THEREFORE THERE CANNOT BE A
AND THINK OF WHAT I HAVE TOLD YOU
I THINK IT IS RATHER EASY TO DEFINE IF YOU ARE NOT TRYING TO GIVE A SCIENTIFIC DEFINITION
YOU'RE A VERY CLEVERLY CONSTRUCTED ROBOT
COMPUTATION ONLY EXISTS RELATIVE TO CONSCIOUSNESS
AND THEY ARE REALIZED IN THE BRAIN AS HIGHER LEVEL OR SYSTEM FEATURES
I DON'T THINK
MAYBE WE WILL BE ABLE TO BUILD A CONSCIOUS MACHINE BUT SINCE WE DON'T KNOW HOW OUR BRAINS DO IT WE ARE NOT IN THE POSITION
BUT WHEN I HOLD OUT MY POCKET CALCULATOR AND DO THE CALCULATION THE ONLY INTRINSIC
THE NEXT FEATURE OF CONSCIOUSNESS AFTER THIS MARVELOUS UNIFIED CONSCIOUS FIELD IS THAT
WHY DID THEY MAKE THE MISTAKE
I DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT
I MEAN I WON'T DEMONSTRATE PAIN BEHAVIOR BUT I CAN TELL YOU I AM NOT HAVING ANY PAINS RIGHT NOW
MORE THAT 30 YEARS AGO BUT THERE IS A DEEPER ARGUMENT IMPLICIT IN WHAT I'VE TOLD YOU
IF IT CONSCIOUSLY SEEMS TO YOU THAT YOU ARE CONSCIOUS YOU ARE CONSCIOUS
THAT'S AN AWFUL PROBLEM
AND THIS IF YOU HAVE EVER HAD A PHILOSOPHY COURSE THIS IS KNOWN AS THE FAMOUS MIND BODY PROBLEM
WELL SOME COMPUTATIONS ARE INTRINSIC
THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF ROBOTICS DERIVES FROM THE FACT THAT WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE A CONSCIOUS ROBOT SO WE DON'T HAVE A
YOU CANNOT DOUBT THE EXISTENCE OF YOUR OWN CONSCIOUSNESS
IT IS AN ILLUSION LIKE SUNSETS
BUT IN ANY CASE IT'S NOT PART OF SCIENCE
I USED TO GET IN AN ARGUMENT THAT REALLY GAVE ME A STOMACHACHE
THAT'S THE FIRST FEATURE OF CONSCIOUSNESS
NOW WE KNOW THAT THAT'S WRONG
AND WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT IN A ROBOT
SO IF YOU BREED A LITTLE MOUSE THAT HAS NO BIOME THIS LITTLE CREATURE IS VERY VULNERABLE TO
ALSO WE'RE BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND THAT A LOT OF THE WHAT IS CALLED AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES
I WOULD SUGGEST WE PROBABLY JUST NEED TO LOOK INSIDE OF US AND REALLY GET HUMBLE BECAUSE THE
THESE KINDS OF THINGS ARE WHEN THERE IS A DYSBIOSIS THERE'S AN IMBALANCE BETWEEN THE GOOD
SO FIRST OF ALL WE HAVE TO RESPECT THEM
THEY HAVE A NIGHT AND DAY RHYTHM JUST LIKE WE DO
HOW MANY GENES
YOU KNOW THEY DON'T KIND OF HANG OUT WITH THEIR PUPPY BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND THEY DON'T EAT WELL AND THEY DON'T DO THINGS
AND MY MOTHER TAUGHT ME ALL ABOUT GERMS AND HOW BAD THEY WERE AND YOU SHOULD ALWAYS WASH YOUR HANDS AND I
WHAT ARE THE GENES THAT WE HAVE
WE'RE ONLY TEN PERCENT
SO WE JUST HEARD HOW WONDERFUL IT IS TO LOOK AT THE ASTRONOMY AND BE HUMBLED
I STRUGGLED FOR MONTHS BEING AWAY FROM MY SON
WE HAVE TO STOP FRAMING THIS AS A MOTHER'S ISSUE OR EVEN A WOMEN'S ISSUE
I CRIED IN THE BATHROOM WHILE I WASHED OUT THE PUMP EQUIPMENT
WE'LL LOOK AT A LOT OF THEM
FOR MONTHS ALL I REMEMBER IS THE SCREAMING
IN AMERICA TODAY WE ARE AT 1
CHILDBIRTH IS AND ALWAYS WILL BE AN ENORMOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL EVENT
I PROMISED MY BOSS THAT THE WORK I DIDN'T GET DONE DURING THE DAY I'D MAKE UP AT NIGHT FROM HOME
I SAY WE DON'T NOT UNTIL THEY'RE OF WORKING AND TAX PAYING AND MILITARY SERVING AGE
WE USED UP ALL OF OUR TAX RETURNS AND HALF OF OUR SAVINGS DURING MY SIX UNPAID WEEKS
THERE'S NOTHING TO SEE HERE
ON A NATIONAL LEVEL OUR PAID WORK IS NOT OPTIONAL
OK THIS IS POP QUIZ TIME
SO CLIMATE CHANGE
WHY ARE YOU WEARING A HAT NOW
THIS WATCH THAT I HAVE CAN DO EVERYTHING THE ENIAC COULD DO WITH AN ENTIRE ROOM 60 YEARS AGO
IF YOU'VE WORKED WITH SIRI YOU KNOW THAT SYNTAX IS STILL A CHALLENGE SOMETIMES FOR COMPUTERS
WE WANT THE AI TO REALLY DO IT RIGHT
SHE'S CONSTANTLY ASKING WHY QUESTIONS
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
AND UNDERSTANDING SCIENCE
BUT WE ARE BETTER AT ASKING WHY
BUT IT MATTERS WHEN IT COMES TO THINGS LIKE MEDICINE
MAYBE IT'S TIME THAT WE TRY
PICTURE OF A GOLF BALL AND A GOLF BALL
I THINK MAYBE WE COULD MAKE SOME PROGRESS
WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BEHIND THIS DATA
THEY CAN IDENTIFY A PERSON
IF THEY REALLY COULD DO THAT PERFECTLY I WOULD BE REALLY IMPRESSED
DARPA WAS TRYING TO HAVE PEOPLE BUILD EMERGENCY ROBOTS AND PEOPLE DID ALL KINDS OF WORK IN THEIR LAB TO BUILD ROBOTS THAT COULD DO THINGS
WE BUILT THAT GENERATIONS OF COMMITED TORONTONIANS BUILT THAT PUBLIC LIBRARY SYSTEM
I'M A PART OF THE CITY
WHY HAVEN'T WE BUILT RAPID TRANSIT
BUT THE SECOND TIME I HAD A REAL SAY
BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY PEOPLE WILL CHOOSE TO GET OUT OF CARS AND ON TO TRANSIT
PEOPLE WHO DESPERATELY NEED RAPID TRANSIT
THE FINCH LINE
AND WE NEED TO TAKE THAT LANGUAGE BACK BECAUSE WE HAVE A RIGHT TO A GREAT CITY
IN TWO GENERATIONS
AND PEOPLE KEPT UP THAT CONVERSATION
IF WE CAN'T DO IT WHY DO WE HAVE THE BEST PUBLIC LIBRARY SYSTEM IN THE WORLD RIGHT HERE IN TORONTO
AND I ALWAYS SAY
WHICH I THINK IS WHAT THEY MEAN TOO
I CHOSE TO LIVE IN TORONTO
MAYBE THESE PEOPLE ARE RIGHT
IT WOULD MAKE A LOT OF SENSE
WE LIVE LONGER
BUT SYMBOLICALLY WHAT HAPPENED
THAT AMP X27 S FAR MORE THAN THE SLAVES THAT WERE TRANSPORTED OUT OF AFRICA OVER A PERIOD OF 400 YEARS
THEY ARE IN THE A CAPELLA VOICE CHOIR
THE I 10 CORRIDOR FROM EL PASO TO HOUSTON IS THE LARGEST CORRIDOR FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING
WE CANNOT EVEN BEGIN TO START TO TELL YOU THE STORIES BECAUSE THEY ARE SO HORRIFIC BUT IN THESE CLIPS YOU MIGHT JUST GET AN IDEA
IF YOU THINK YOU CANNOT MAKE A DIFFERENCE THAT AMP X27 S WRONG
SO IN THAT WAY THE KIDS WERE FORCED TO WORK INCREDIBLE HOURS NO BREAKS NO NOTHING
AND AS SHE IS FALLING YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT'S GOING THROUGH HER MIND
AND ALL OF THIS CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE
BUT IT ISN AMP X27 T SAFE FOR EVERYBODY
MUCH CLOSER TO HOME WE SAW THIS LADY FROM THE HUMAN TRAFFICKING UNIT IN MEXICO
BEIRUT BOSNIA SOMALIA BAGHDAD THE WORKS
SO WHEN THE POLICE CAME SHE SAID SHE FELL WHEN SHE WAS TRYING TO RUN AWAY
SO WE CO PRODUCED WITH THE HELP OF AN ORGANIZATION CALLED AMP QUOT END HUMAN TRAFFICKING NOW AMP QUOT A SIX PART SERIES FOR THE
SHE GOT SOLD FROM ONE FAMILY TO ANOTHER THEN ANOTHER WOMAN STARTED MAKING HER SHORT SKIRTS AND THINGS LIKE
HE WAS THE POWERFUL ONE
AND THAT COULDN'T HAPPEN BECAUSE THE PARENTS WOULD HAVE A HARD TIME ACCEPTING THAT THIS WAS YOUR TICKET TO FREEDOM TO
THERE ARE AT LEAST 27 MILLION SLAVES IN THIS WORLD TODAY 27 MILLION
ALL OF US CAN REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE
AS A RESULT THAT OWNER AND I WON'T SAY EMPLOYER IT WAS THE OWNER PUSHED HER OFF THE THIRD FLOOR
SHE'S TRYING TO TELL US AND SHE IS SAYING I LOOK DOWN AND I SAY HOW DO I ROTATE MYSELF WHAT DO I DO
AND THE SAME STORY IS REPEATED NOT JUST THE CHURCH
THEY WANT YOUR MONEY THEY WILL LISTEN
BECAUSE THE OWNER PRETENDED TO THE POLICE THAT THIS WOMAN WAS TRYING TO RUN AWAY SHE PACKED ALL THE CLOTHES IN BAGS AND PUT THEM OUT
A LOT OF THE KIDS THAT WENT BACK BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T COPE WITH ALL OF THIS WHEN THERE WAS ALCOHOLISM OR DRUGS OR VIOLENCE
AND WHAT HAPPENS SOME OF THESE ARE JUST SIMPLE DISPUTES WHERE PEOPLE LEAVE HOME
SHE FOUGHT THE SYSTEM AND MADE SURE THAT HE HAD A SAFE HOME HERE
AND SOMEBODY BEFRIENDS THEM BECOMES A BOYFRIEND MAKES THEM FEEL GOOD
SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING AS A NANNY SHE TURNED OUT TO BE A DOMESTIC SLAVE
ASK THEM AND THEY WILL LISTEN
IN THE AGE OF WONDERMENT THAT IS MY QUESTION THAT IN THE 21ST CENTURY WHY ARE WE ALLOWING
IT EXISTS IN A BIG WAY
WE HAD OUR CREWS COVER SOME RAIDS WHERE THE POLICE ACTUALLY FREED SOME OF THESE KIDS
HER OWNER WENT SCOT FREE
HERE WE SAW WHAT HAPPENED
WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE
EVERYTHING WAS FINE BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN I WAS GETTING MY THRILLS MY ADRENALINE UPS HIGHS LOWS
IT IS EVEN AHEAD OF DRUGS
HUMAN BEINGS ARE BEING SOLD AND RESOLD AND RESOLD IT FETCHES 32 BILLION
WE CAN ASK THE RIGHT QUESTIONS ASK PEOPLE WHO MAKE OUR GARMENTS ARE THESE GARMENTS
YOU CAN CALL HOTLINES THAT ARE SET UP
WE LOOK AT THE BOY IN INDIA
FOR ALL YOU KNOW YOU MAY BE SITTING AMONGST PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN TRAFFICKED BEFORE AND YOU WOULD NOT EVEN KNOW IT
A GUY WHO'S GOT A GIRL AND A BOY COUSINS AND HE'S SELLING THEM VERY HAPPY VERY HAPPY TO SELL THEM TO OUR
ASK THE CHOCOLATE MANUFACTURERS IS THIS SLAVE LABOR CHILD LABOR FROM WEST AFRICA
SO MANY PEOPLE ARE SOLD INTO SLAVERY BY PEOPLE IN WHOM THEY HAVE PLACED TRUST
NOW A FOURTH FACTOR REALLY BECOMES AN OBSESSION WHICH IS NEVER BETRAY
THAT'S PART ONE
SAME MONTH EVERY YEAR
DID YOU NOTICE OTHER PEOPLE NOT FINDING THE APP THAT DAY
YOU'RE BEING FORCED TO BE WHETHER YOU WANT IT OR NOT A KIND OF GLOBAL VISIONARY WHO'S CHANGING THE WORLD
BUT WE DON'T WANT JUST ANY MATH PROBLEM WE WANT THE HARDEST ONES THAT WE CAN POSSIBLY FIND AND WE WANT THE ONE THAT IF YOU SOLVE IT
OKAY BESIDES NORMAN BATES
DON'T ASSUME THAT SOMEONE ELSE'S STORY DOESN'T HAVE VALUE SIMPLY BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MEASURE UP TO
BUT WHAT IF WE'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THE NATURE OF CHOICE MAKING ALL WRONG
SETTING ASIDE THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT AID IN OVERCOMING ADVERSITY MOST PEOPLE COME
WHY WERE MY LIFE'S GREATEST LESSONS PREDICATED ON HER PAIN
AND TRULY IN THAT MOMENT THAT WOMAN AND EVERY WOMAN LIKE HER BECAME MY MOTHER
WE TALKED ABOUT WRITING NEW POLICIES RELAXING THE RULES OF EXISTING POLICY OR CREATING NEW
EVERY TIME I'VE BEEN THAT MODEL FOR SOMEONE ELSE LIVES HAVE CHANGED
REHABILITATION AS AN OPERATIVE DEFINITION THAT IS PEOPLE CENTERED RATHER THAN SYSTEM CENTERED
CRACKED SIDEWALKS BE DAMNED
AND THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE FOR ME WAS ARTICULATING THIS CONCEPT OF REHABILITATION SIMPLY BECAUSE IT WAS
NOW I DIDN'T SIT DOWN ONE DAY AND WRITE A LIST OF MY BESTIES AND MOMS JUST HAPPENED TO BE AT THE TOP
SO WHAT TAKES THE PLACE OF THAT HEALTHY SUPPORT SYSTEM NOW OUT OF REACH
AND WHY DID MY STORY CIRCLE AROUND HERS
I JUST MISSED HER
AFTER SHE WAS GONE I EVEN QUESTIONED THE VALUE OF HER LIFE SO WHILE HER DEATH WRUNG OUT MY HEART
THAT HAPPENED THE DAY SOMEONE CALLED ME A MANIPULATOR
WE BEGAN WORKING WITH MANUFACTURERS TO SCALE UP THIS TECHNOLOGY AND WE'RE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THEM
WE HAVEN'T YET GONE TO ANOTHER PLANET
SO YOU AND I ARE DIRECT BENEFICIARIES OF REMOVED RAINFORESTS
AND WE MADE AN OIL THAT'S SIMILAR TO PALM OIL
SO IN THIS WAY A CLOSED LOOP CARBON CYCLE IS CREATED
ON A LONG SPACE JOURNEY YOU SIMPLY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO PICK UP ANY CARBON ALONG THE WAY SO YOU'D HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
WE HAVEN'T YET GONE TO MARS
I WORK WITH SURGICAL TEAMS
THE TRADITIONAL SURGERY IS TO TAKE A BIT OF THE CRANIUM OFF A BIT OF THE SKULL DRAIN THIS FLUID OUT STICK A DRAIN IN
WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SHOW YOU IS A REPRODUCTION OF THIS CHILD
THIS TECHNIQUE WILL BRING YOU THERE
AND NOT JUST HOCKEY RIGHT
THAT WOULD BE PRETTY AWESOME RIGHT
IT'S CREATING SOME EXCITEMENT OBVIOUSLY IT'S CREATING SOME DEMAND
FOR INSTANCE SPACEX IS PROJECTING LAUNCH COSTS AS LOW AS 5 MILLION BY THE TIME THEIR TECHNOLOGY BECOMES MATURE THAT'S ALMOST 100
YOU CAN EXPLORE SPACE FOR THE SHEER EXCITEMENT OF IT FOR THE SCIENCE
WHY DO WE SPEND ALL THESE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO SEND ROVERS TO MARS
IT WOULD PROBABLY GIVE THE ASTRONAUTS A LITTLE PICK ME UP IN THE MORNING BEFORE THEIR SPACEWALK
ASHTON KUTCHER'S GOING INTO SPACE THAT'S GREAT
TRANSPORTATION COMMUNICATION EDUCATION THESE ARE ALL AREAS ON EARTH THAT HAVE PROBLEMS THAT IN
PRIVATE INDUSTRY CAN BRING WITH IT LOTS OF DIFFERENT BENEFITS
WE CAN'T EVEN SEND OUR OWN ASTRONAUTS INTO SPACE ANYMORE
THAT REALLY INTRIGUED ME
PRIVATE COMPANIES CAN HELP LOWER THAT COST THEY ALREADY HAVE
MOST DAYS MY NAME IS WAITRESS AT MY FAMILY'S DAMASCUS RESTAURANT FULL TIME
I WILL TAKE YOU FROM KUALA LUMPUR TO BARCELONA TO BEIRUT
HE WASN'T EVEN SICK
WELL I AM THAT LITTLE BOY
HE WANTED TO QUIT EVERYTHING
THEY DESERVE IT
EVERYWHERE HE LOOKED WAS THE SIGHT OF HIS FAMILY OF HIS FRIENDS
WELL THE ULTIMATE REASON OF WHY I'M HERE TODAY IS NOT TO LECTURE YOU ABOUT SCIENCE OR ABOUT
ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A LITTLE BOY IN A LITTLE PLACE WHO LOVES LOVES TO
WELL I MEAN THAT'S NOT TRUE BUT ANYWAY
THAT'S WHAT I DO
THEY WANTED BLACKS TO BE TRIED BY JURIES OF THEIR PEERS BECAUSE TO THAT POINT THEY WERE BEING TRIED BY ALL WHITES
AND THE BOOK HAS THIS PICTURE ON THE COVER
MAYBE IF YOU CALL THE U
IT WOUNDED SEVERAL PEOPLE
THEY WOULD WORK WITH THESE ORGANIZATIONS AND SET UP THE SAME KINDS OF PROGRAMS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES
YOU PROBABLY SAW THIS A FEW WEEKS AGO
WE HAVE TO FIND OUT THE TRUTH ABOUT THIS ORGANIZATION FOR OURSELVES AND I ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO THAT
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH NOT WANTING TO BE KILLED BY THE POLICE
SO WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES WHAT IS IT ABOUT THIS ORGANIZATION
AND I SAID OK
I KNEW THAT WHEN I WAS DRIVING THIS CAR BACK FROM IOWA I WAS GOING TO HAVE TO PASS THROUGH THIS TOWN SO I TOOK THE
AND THEN I HEAR MY NAME OVER THE INTERCOM
WE NEED A LOT OF COURAGE
OF COURSE IT MATTERS
WE KNOW WHO WE ARE
AND YET WE ALL SUFFER FROM SELF DOUBT
WE TAKE A MAGNIFYING GLASS AND WE LOOK AT OUR BEHAVIORS
I REALLY WOULD LOVE TO CONNECT TO HER
AFTER TWO MINUTES I TAKE MY EYES OFF HER AND SHE'S ON HER PHONE
WHAT WAS I THINKING
WHY SHOULD SHE LIKE THE MUSIC
IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE
WHERE DOES THE ENERGY COME FROM
YOU CAN INFLUENCE YOUR OWN TECHNOLOGIES YOU HAVE INVENTED
ONE SHOT OR TWO INHALED BY SOFT TISSUE STOMPED STRAIGHT ON ANOTHER DOWNSOUTH
I REALLY LOVE POETRY
JUST BY SAYING SOMETHING LIKE YOU'RE FAT' OR NOBODY LIKES YOU' CAN CAUSE PEOPLE TO THINKING DOWN ON THEMSELVES
THEN THE WHOLE THIRD GRADE FOUND OUT AND IT MADE ME FEEL DOWN ON MYSELF AND NOT WANT
WE JUDGE PEOPLE BECAUSE OF JEALOUSY WHEN WE SE SOMEONE WE AUTOMATICALLY JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THEM
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD THE SAYING DON'T JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER
WELL THAT'S ALWAYS TRUE
I THINK THAT'S WHAT HELPED DRIVE THIS
THIS IS THAT GREAT BIG SECRET
IT'S THE PART OF YOU THAT YEARNS REALLY FOR GOD
WHAT'S LIFE ALL ABOUT
AND ANOTHER MAN LOOKED IN MY DIRECTION AND SAID YES THERE HE IS
HE'S ON THIS ELEVATOR WITH US
AND THE BIBLE SAYS THAT DAVID LAID UP GREAT STORES OF IRON AND WHICH ARCHAEOLOGISTS HAVE
IT'S POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO BE IN WHITOPIA NOT FOR RACIST REASONS THOUGH IT
WE TALKED TO OVER 3000 INDIVIDUALS ALMOST 3600 AGED 18 TO 70 AND WE
THERE HAS NOT BEEN A DECADE OF TELEVISION WITHOUT A DEFINITIVE DOMINANT TV MOM
S MOST POPULAR SHOWS ARE EXPORTED AROUND THE WORLD
THE OTHER THING ABOUT HUMAN BEINGS IS THAT WE LOVE TO BE ENTERTAINED
AND ON A FACTUAL BASIS OVER 80 PERCENT OF THE U
WE'RE ANIMALS WE NEED OUR MOMS
ONE BASIC INSTINCT REMAINS
SO THANKS VERY MUCH
AND FOR THE WAY IN WHICH I'M GOING TO PRESENT THE DATA I WANT TO THANK TED COMMUNITY SUPERSTAR HANS
THE SOCIALLY IRREVERENT HIPPIE SHOW ROWAN AND MARTIN'S LAUGH IN
WHY HAS TELEVISION ENTERTAINMENT EVOLVED THE WAY IT HAS
THEY IN FACT BERATE IT
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT POPULAR TV
THAT IS SEPARATE AND APART FROM THE ANIMAL KINGDOM
NOW WE'RE NOT GONNA VISIT ANY OF THOSE PLANETS IN MY LIFETIME
AND THEN THEY GO ON TO BECOME A GENETICIST OR A COMPUTER SCIENTIST OR AN APP DEVELOPER OR WHATEVER IT IS I THINK
I DON'T KNOW
PROBABLY NOT IN MY CHILDREN'S LIFETIME BUT SOME DAY WE WILL
THAT WAS THE PREVAILING STORY IN THE MEDIA
THAT'S A GAME CHANGER
WE NEED TO ASK THAT QUESTION WE NEED TO HAVE A GOOD ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION
IN FACT I'M SO OVERWHELMED THAT I CANNOT PUT THAT NUMBER INTO CONTEXT
I DON'T EXACTLY WALK AROUND WITH 135 BILLION DOLLARS IN MY WALLET
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE YOU COULD DO WITH THAT MONEY
CALL IT IMPOSSIBLY IDEALISTIC IF YOU MUST
CA BENOIT MANDELBROT IS IN THE AUDIENCE
SOME PEOPLE HIT THE BOTTLE START TAKING MEDICATION
LET'S SAY THIS IS AN ANXIOUS THOUGHT
AND THE BEAUTY OF IT IS THAT EVEN THOUGH IT NEED ONLY TAKE ABOUT 10 MINUTES A DAY IT IMPACTS OUR
WE MISS OUT ON THE THINGS THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO US AND THE CRAZY THING IS THAT EVERYBODY JUST ASSUMES
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BURN ANY INCENSE AND YOU DEFINITELY DON'T HAVE TO SIT ON THE FLOOR
WELL OBVIOUSLY IT CHANGED THINGS
YOU GO BACK TO IT REPEAT IT
I'M GOING TO DROP THEM
EQUALLY IF I RELAX TOO MUCH TALKING TO YOU THERE'S NO WAY I CAN FOCUS ON THE BALLS
WOW THERE'S SO MUCH ANXIETY
YOU MIGHT FIND A MIND THAT'S VERY DULL AND BORING AND IT'S JUST ALMOST MECHANICAL IT JUST SEEMS IT'S
EVERYTHING'S GOING FINE AND WE SEE THE ANXIOUS THOUGHT
WE NEED AN EXERCISE
THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT MEDITATION IS
AND IT'S ONLY IN LEARNING TO WATCH THE MIND IN THIS WAY THAT WE CAN START TO LET GO OF THOSE STORYLINES AND
EVERY TIME I SORT OF PUSHED ONE DOWN ANOTHER ONE WOULD POP BACK UP AGAIN
IN FACT WE SPEND MORE TIME LOOKING AFTER OUR CARS OUR CLOTHES AND OUR HAIR THAN WE OKAY MAYBE NOT OUR
THE PACE OF LIFE IS OFTEN FRANTIC OUR MINDS ARE ALWAYS BUSY AND WE'RE ALWAYS DOING SOMETHING
THE RESULT OF COURSE IS THAT WE GET STRESSED
AND WE REINFORCE THE STORYLINE RIGHT
MY WORK WAS INCREDIBLE I LOVED IT
I SAID ALRIGHT SARAH TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON
HOW CAN I GET MOTIVATED
IT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT
HE WAS VERY CONFUSED AND I COULD TELL
IN THAT MOMENT EVERYBODY ALLOWED THEMSELVES TO BE SEEN THEY WERE VULNERABLE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THEY WERE ALL INCREDIBLY EXPERIENCES THE PEOPLE I WORKED WITH THEY INSPIRED ME
NOBODY WANTS TO HEAR SOMEBODY SAY THAT
SO I SAT SARAH DOWN RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME
YOU KNOW INSPIRATION IT'S WHEN WE'RE NOT TRYING TO BECAME INSPIRED THAT WE ARE INSPIRED
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT RIGHT
CISCO IS AN AMAZING COMPANY THEY CREATE CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY BUT WHAT MAKES THEM SO GREAT AND THEY UNDERSTAND THIS
AND IT WAS REALLY FUNNY
HOW CAN I STAY MOTIVATED
BECAUSE OF THOSE CHEMICALS
THIS IS BAD
SOMETHING'S UP WITH MY SON
I'LL SAY THIS
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN PEOPLE STARTED TO OPEN UP
EVERYBODY TALKED ABOUT SOMETHING THEY HAD ACHIEVED SOMETHING THAT WAS A CHALLENGE IN THEIR LIFE
THIS HAPPENED FOR WEEKS AND THEN FINALLY WE GOT TO THE POINT WHERE WE IT'S LIKE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET A THERAPIST INVOLVED
NOW BEFORE I LEAVE YOU TODAY I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU A STORY ABOUT A MOMENT IN MY LIFE
I MEAN NOT ONLY DID MY PEERS QUESTION MY LEGITIMACY BUT AIRPORT SECURITY
I BELIEVE IN WOMENS' RIGHTS EQUALITY AND FREEDOM
THEY MUST WEAR ALL WHITE AFTER THEIR HUSBANDS DIE FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES
ISLAM ALSO FURTHER INCREASES A WOMAN'S AUTONOMY BY GIVING HER MARITAL RIGHTS
AND HISTORICAL RECORDS ALSO SHOW THAT PROPHET MUHAMMAD WOULD CONSULT WOMEN ON DECISIONS
PEOPLE CAN MAKE THAT INDIVIDUAL CHOICE TO USE A REFILLABLE BOTTLE INSTEAD
SWITCH TO A REFILLABLE BOTTLE
THEY'RE QUITE EXTRAORDINARY
THIS JUST GOES TO SHOW THAT THERE IS NO FORMULA TO BEING A CONSERVATIONIST
WE HAVE THE LARGEST LIVING CORAL ATOLL IN THE WORLD
WHY AM I STILL AND OCEAN OPTIMIST
BUT THE PROBLEM IS THESE TRADES HAVE MEANT THAT SEAHORSES HAVE BECOME A
THERE WASN'T EVEN A DEGREE ON THE TOPIC WHEN I WAS IN UNIVERSITY AND NOW THERE ARE MANY BUT IT'S STILL A TINY BUSINESS
AND WROTE IN SOME STORIES ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON IN OUR HOUSE AND IN THE WORLD AROUND ME
UNCOVER HOW THEY MAY HAVE GROWN FROM TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES
BUT BASICALLY YOU CAN TAKE A CELLPHONE OR A TABLET OR A HEADSET AND MOVE AROUND THREE DIMENSIONAL
MINUS 50 WAS THE COLDEST
SCOTT'S TEAM WERE ON FOOT ALL FIVE OF THEM WEARING HARNESSES AND DRAGGING AROUND SLEDGES AND THEY ARRIVED AT THE POLE TO FIND THE
I REMEMBER SITTING THERE LOOKING DOWN AT MY SLEDGE
MALLORY POSTULATED THAT THERE IS SOMETHING IN MAN THAT RESPONDS TO THE CHALLENGE OF THE MOUNTAIN AND I WONDER
IN LIFE WE ALL HAVE TEMPESTS TO RIDE AND POLES TO WALK TO AND I THINK METAPHORICALLY SPEAKING AT LEAST WE COULD ALL
PART OF ME FELT QUITE PROUD OF MYSELF BUT MOSTLY I WAS JUST UTTERLY TERRIFIED
NO ONE HAD EVER DONE THIS
I WAS 26 AT THE TIME
NOW OUR FAST ACTING RESULTS WERE PRETTY INTERESTING BUT WE STILL HAD ONE LINGERING QUESTION CAN OUR STICKY
MOTHERS DRESSED IN SARIS SIT AT THE ROADSIDE
THEY PUT PRESSURE ON CORPORATIONS
I SAID LOOK I HAVE A NEW VIDEO CAMERA
DID YOU HAVE A BREAK UP
THEY TOLD ME WHAT WAS HAPPENING OUT IN THE WORLD WITH SIX WORDS IDEAS I'D NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT
THEY HAVE IDEAS THAT CARRY CHARISMA AND THEY HAVE ABOVE ALL ELSE THE IDEA OF ISLAM WHICH IS A
SO DEMOCRACY CAN ADAPT ADJUST AND BE MOVED FROM PLACE TO PLACE LT BR GT AND CAN BE MADE TO BE RECONCILED WITH DIFFERENT WORLD
THEY ARE GOOD AT GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATION
BY THE WAY PARENTHETICALLY IT IS OBVIOUS IN THE US CASE
NOW WHAT HAPPENS USUALLY BETWEEN STAGE ONE LT BR GT AND STAGE TWO OF A REVOLUTION
WEARABLE SOLAR GIVES YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHARGE YOUR PHONE ON THE GO WHEREVER YOU ARE
SO WE ARE NOW LOOKING AT SOLAR HARVESTING FIBERS PRINTABLE SOLAR CELLS AND WASHABLE TEXTILE CIRCUITS TO UPGRADE THE
AND NOT ONLY DID I WANT TO MOUNT 600 OF THESE ON THE GARMENT I ALSO WANTED TO ADDRESS EACH DOT
ONE OF THE MAIN ISSUES FOR INSTANCE IS THAT THEY'RE NOT WASHABLE
THESE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I'M CURRENTLY RESEARCHING AS PART OF MY PHD PROGRAM CALLED CRAFTING WEARABLES AT THE
NOBODY KNEW WHAT TO DO WITH IT
THERE ARE TWO THINGS WE ALWAYS HAVE WITH US WHEN WE LEAVE THE HOUSE
IT DESCRIBES THE IDEA THAT OUR CONTEMPORARY SURROUNDINGS ARE CONSTANTLY CHANGING AND THEY HAVE BECOME
SO FOR ONE OF MY RECENT COLLECTIONS I DEVELOPED A DYNAMIC TEXTILE THAT WOULD ENHANCE THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE
AND THIS KINETIC GARMENT CAN RESPOND TO THE SURROUNDINGS IN TERMS OF SOUND
I GREW UP IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS WITH THEM
THAT WE'VE GOT PEOPLE THAT COME IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND COME IN OUR SCHOOLS WANTING TO TEACH BECAUSE WE NEED HELP
I KNOW THEM
BUT AT THE SAME TIME THEY DON'T EVEN TRY TO UNDERSTAND US
BUT IF YOU STAY IN SCHOOL AND YOU WORK HARD MAYBE YOU CAN COME BACK AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS
THEY WANT TO DO IT 9 TO 5 AND LEAVE THE PROBLEM AND ESCAPE TO THE SAFETY OF THEIR OWN HOMES
THEY ARE AFRAID TO GET THEIR HANDS DIRTY
IT WAS A VERY STRONG TRANSITION FOR ME IN MANY WAYS
SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS ARE VERY EXTREME
AND I WANT YOU TO HEAR WHAT I HEARD
INFORMATION ACCESS EMPOWERS US TO FLOURISH
YET AS ASTRONOMERS WE STUDY A WIDER RANGE OF LIGHT AND WE DEPEND
BUT THAT WAS NO END
YET INFORMATION ACCESS IS NOT THE ONLY AREA IN ASTRONOMY WHERE THIS IS
WHEN I LOST MY SIGHT I NOTICED THAT I DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME AMOUNT AND QUALITY OF
THIS ABILITY TO TRANSFORM DATA INTO SOUND GIVES ASTRONOMY A TREMENDOUS POWER OF
WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM IF THEY DEVELOP A DISABILITY
BUT THE ONES THAT EMIT GAMMA RAYS ARE EVEN MORE EXTREME
AND BECAUSE YOU'RE SIGHTED I'M GIVING YOU A RED LINE INDICATING WHAT INTENSITY OF LIGHT IS BEING CONVERTED INTO
SHE TRANSFORMED INTO A SUPERNOVA AND IN THE PROCESS RELEASING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF
EXACTLY HOW LONG PEOPLE CANNOT REALLY TELL
AND JUST FOR YOUR INFORMATION THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF A MAGNETAR IS 1000 TRILLION TIMES THE
WE DEPEND WE RELY ON OTHER METHODS IN ORDER TO STUDY THIS GAMMA RAY LIGHT
AND BEYOND THAT WE RELY ON OTHER METHODS
THE HISTORY OF CIVILIZATION IN SOME WAYS IS A HISTORY OF MAPS HOW HAVE WE COME TO UNDERSTAND THE WORLD AROUND US
IT'S NO LONGER JUST ABOUT TAX AND SPEND
THE FIRST RELATES TO THE IDEA OF CIVIC EDUCATION
THE FAULT LINE OF CONTEMPORARY POLITICS IS BETWEEN THOSE THAT EMBRACE GLOBALIZATION AND THOSE THAT
SO WE NEED TO ENCOURAGE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS
HINDSIGHT IS A WONDERFUL THING
IT'S ABOUT GLOBALIZATION
IT'S BEEN SUGGESTED THAT WE'VE MOVED TO A POSTFACTUAL SOCIETY WHERE EVIDENCE AND TRUTH NO LONGER
BUT AMID AUSTERITY AND THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OF 2008 THE CONCEPT DISAPPEARED ALMOST
AND HE SAID AND I PARAPHRASE THE GLASS HOUSE OF GLOBALIZATION
SO WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THIS MISINFORMATION THE GAP BETWEEN PERCEPTION AND REALITY ON KEY ASPECTS OF
IT CREATES WINNERS AND LOSERS
I AM STILL A GLOBAL CITIZEN
WHAT STANDS OUT FROM BREXIT IS THE GAP BETWEEN PUBLIC PERCEPTION AND EMPIRICAL REALITY
THAT VISION OF GLOBALIZATION IS ONE THAT HAS TO START BY A RECOGNITION OF THE
THE CONSENSUS AMONGST ECONOMISTS IS THAT FREE TRADE THE MOVEMENT OF CAPITAL THE MOVEMENT OF
THAT WAS THE SPEECH IN WHICH HE COINED THAT TERM
GEOGRAPHICALLY IT WAS LONDON AND SCOTLAND THAT MOST STRONGLY COMMITTED TO BEING PART OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WHILE IN
THERE WERE CALLS FOR A SECOND REFERENDUM ALMOST AS IF FOLLOWING A SPORTS MATCH WE COULD ASK THE
EVERYBODY WAS BLAMING EVERYBODY ELSE
WAS IT SOMETHING THAT TOOK PLACE OVERNIGHT
WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT OLDER GENERATIONS WHO MAYBE CAN'T TRAVEL GET ACCESS TO THE INTERNET
AND I TRIED TO LEARN I TRIED TO STUDY
I'M THE NUMBER ONE
SO I JUST WANT TO COME BACK TO NORMAL
BUT BY THIS TIME I HOPE I'VE GAINED YOUR RESPECT
YOU'RE ONLY 17 YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT PSYCHOLOGY
I CAN HOLD YOU ACCOUNTABLE TOO
I THINK THAT IT DOESN'T COME WITH AGE OR EXPERIENTIAL MATURITY
I'D TRY TALKING TO AN ADULT ABOUT SOMETHING I'D BE WORKING ON MY RESEARCH OR A PROJECT AND
THE ADULTS BEHIND THEM HAVE CONDITIONED ATTEMPTS AT SOLVING THEM WHICH IS WHY WE HAVEN'T MADE ANY
IT'S TRUE THAT NOT ALL OF US WILL UNDERSTAND THESE POLICIES RIGHT AWAY
I'VE BEEN TOLD BY ADULTS THAT I'M NOT READY TO VOTE EVEN THOUGH I KEEP UP WITH POLITICS AND I'M SURE OF MY BELIEFS
ASK US ABOUT SOCIAL SECURITY ASK US ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL DESTRUCTION ASK
I SAY GAINED BECAUSE UNLIKE THE OTHER SPEAKERS I DIDN'T HAVE IT INITIALLY
DO WE WAKE UP ON OUR 21ST BIRTHDAYS WITH EVERLASTING KNOWLEDGE
SOMETIMES I CATCH MYSELF ON A WILD TRAIN OF THOUGHT AND STOP MYSELF THINKING
IT'S NO SECRET THAT SOCIETY HAS A LOT OF PROBLEMS THAT WE JUST CAN'T QUITE SEEM TO SOLVE
YOU DON'T DESERVE TO HAVE THE CONTROL OVER WHAT YOU LEARN
IT HASN'T SEEMED TO WORK SO FAR SO WHO'S RIGHT
MAYBE THIS PROBLEM IS THAT WE'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT THESE SOLUTIONS CREATIVELY
I HAVEN'T WON A NOBEL PEACE PRIZE I HAVEN'T SOLVED INEQUALITY I HAVEN'T SOLVED POVERTY
SO THAT'S NOT LOGICAL EITHER
ADULTS I'M ASKING YOU TO WORK WITH US
GIVE US YOUR RESPECT HOLD US ACCOUNTABLE
HOW COULD YOU KNOW THIS
FROM MY CONTRASTING EXPERIENCES AT ONE STONE AND WITH THE HELP OF THE AMAZING TEACHERS I'VE HAD I'VE BECOME FULLY
WE NEED TO HOLD EACH OTHER ACCOUNTABLE FOR ANY PROGRESS TO BE MADE AND I PROMISE YOU IT WILL
IN OTHER WORDS WE'RE TEACHING THEM TO STOP THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX AND TO ACCEPT ADEQUACY
JUST BECAUSE WE'RE TEENAGERS DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE DON'T UNDERSTAND POLITICS AND SIMILARLY JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE AN ADULT DOESN'T
WHAT CAN I TEACH YOU ABOUT
WHEN I TOOK THIS STAGE YOU ALL ASSUMED THAT I'M SOME CHILD GENIUS OR SOME ACCREDITED
I MUST HAVE DONE SOMETHING WORTHY OF YOUR ATTENTION
I'M NOT ASKING FOR BLIND FAITH I'M ASKING FOR YOU TO LET US PROVE IT
BECAUSE I'M 17 AND I'M ON THIS STAGE YOU'RE ONLY RESPECTING ME BECAUSE I'M ON THIS STAGE
BUT UNFORTUNATELY THIS WILL ONLY WORK IF IT'S A COLLABORATION
THIS IS MY IDEA WORTH SPREADING
PROBABLY NOT RIGHT
EVENTUALLY I GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE
FOR TEENAGERS IT'S AT THE LUNCHROOM TABLE
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO DO
THEY TAKE MORE RISKS
WHERE ARE YOU BEING EVALUATED EITHER BY YOUR FRIENDS
LIKE I HAVE BECOME THIS
THEY SAY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FINISH COLLEGE
WE ALSO EVALUATE THESE PEOPLE MUCH MORE POSITIVELY OVERALL
I AM ACTUALLY DOING THIS
CONFIGURE YOUR BRAIN TO COPE THE BEST IN THAT SITUATION
I WAS THROWN FROM THE CAR
YOU'RE JUST GOING TO DO IT AND DO IT AND DO IT EVEN IF YOU'RE TERRIFIED AND JUST PARALYZED AND HAVING AN OUT OF
IT'S YOU TALKING TO YOURSELF
SO THIS REALLY SPIKES YOUR CORTISOL
GET YOUR CORTISOL DOWN
BUT REALLY POWER IS ALSO ABOUT HOW YOU REACT TO STRESS
EVEN THE BBC AND THE NEW YORK TIMES
SO HOW MANY OF YOU ARE SORT OF MAKING YOURSELVES SMALLER
WE MAKE OURSELVES SMALL
GET YOUR TESTOSTERONE UP
SEE I KEEP MY HAIR NATURAL SO IT'S NOT TO DEVIATE TOO FAR FROM THE MASTERWORK THE CREATOR HAS GIVEN
MAYBE THAT'S WHY
MY HAIR IS IMPORTANT TO ME
I THOUGHT TO MYSELF
ONE DAY WE GO TO ANOTHER MALL
HE HAD BEEN CONSCRIPTED INTO MY GROUP HE REALLY WANTED TO BE IN
I'LL FIND IT I'LL FIND IT
I LIKE THEM ALREADY
IT'S WRAPPED UP IN MY CULTURAL HERITAGE
IT'S A CROSS CULTURAL EXCHANGE
FOR THE YOUNG PEOPLE OF DURBAN
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO WITH MY HAIR
IN A WORLD OF I'M TOO SICK
I'M TOO FAT
THAT'S THE FAST TRACK
I'VE READ THAT THE KIDNEYS WILL ACTUALLY MOVE 2 3 CENTIMETERS WITH A PROPER BREATH
I'M TOO OLD TO TRY TO JUMP THAT PUDDLE
I'M NOT GOING TO TRY TO JUMP THAT
SHE SAW NO NEGATIVE OUTCOME FROM TRYING TO JUMP THAT PUDDLE
I'M TOO SICK
EVERY MORNING WHEN YOU WAKE UP BEFORE A MEETING WE'RE GOING TO BLOCK ONE SIDE OF YOUR NOSE AND I WANT YOU TO TAKE TEN BREATHS
AND IT BLEW MY MIND
RESEARCH INTO PEOPLE WITH LOW BACK PAIN JUST FOUR OR FIVE WEEKS OF EXERCISES SIMILAR TO THE ONES I'M GOING TO SHOW
AND IT'S CAUSING US SOME PROBLEMS
YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE AND HEART RATE ARE GOING TO BE JACKED THEY'RE GOING TO BE THROUGH THE ROOF
EVENTUALLY SURE YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM IS GOING TO GO OUT OF WHACK
AND THAT THESE STAINED GLASSES THAT I'M SHOWING YOU AS I WILL SHOW YOU IN A MOMENT IN MORE DETAILS ARE ACTUALLY
TODAY WE ARE IN A PARTICULARLY EXCITING PERIOD IN HISTORY BECAUSE WITH MODERN NANOTECHNOLOGY TOOLS
HUMAN FASCINATION FOR CONTROLLING AND MANIPULATING LIGHT IS ACTUALLY MUCH OLDER THAN WELLS PROBABLY
THE FIRST TWO LETTERS ARE ACTUALLY THE HI THAT YOU SAW THAT YOU SAW WITH YOUR EARS A SECOND AGO
OF THESE HUGE NUMBER OF NEURONS ABOUT QUARTER IS DEDICATED TO VISION
SO MAYBE THE BRAIN IS A TASK MACHINE RATHER THAN A SENSORY MACHINE
THE ANSWER IS ACTUALLY QUITE SURPRISING
SO ONE IS SHORT ONE IS LONGER AND PURER
THIS IS ACTUALLY AN ILLUSION
SIT AT HOME AND WAIT
ACCORDING TO THE CLASSICAL VIEW OF HOW THE BRAIN IS ORGANIZED THE BRAIN IS A SENSORY MACHINE
OK SO IF YOU MANAGED TO DO IT WELL DONE
OR HAVE THEY CHANGED FUNCTION
WE CAN SEE IT IN THE NEXT MOVIE PAY ATTENTION TO THE ACTIVATION WHICH IS HIGHLIGHTED IN YELLOW
ARE THEY DEAD UNEMPLOYED
NOW LET'S ADD A LITTLE SUNSHINE
NOW A BLIND IN THIS CASE HAMUTAL ALSO BLIND FROM BIRTH WILL WANT TO ENTER A
I WILL GIVE YOU ONE CLUE
BUT THE IMAGE THAT YOU SEE IN YOUR BRAIN AND THIS IS THE IMAGE THAT COUNTS CHANGED FOREVER
BUT NEVER MIND ABOUT MAX'S BRAIN LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR OWN BRAIN
IN THIS PROJECT WE ARE TRYING TO TEACH BLIND INDIVIDUALS TO SEE USING MUSIC
AND IN SENSORY AUGMENTATION I'M TALKING ABOUT ADDING A NEW ABILITY TO THE ABILITIES THAT WE ALREADY HAVE
I INVITE YOU TO TAKE THAT RISK WITH ME
I HOPE YOU'LL TAKE IT WITH ME
WE'RE ALL LUCKY
AND THEN INTERESTINGLY BRIAN'S FROM BARTLESVILLE
ALL YOU FROM OKLAHOMA CITY AND TULSA TOO BAD
HE COULD PLAY THE BIG TIME
AND SO THIS IS KIND OF JUST A CONVERSATION WITH THE CROWD
WE'RE LUCKY TO BE FROM OKLAHOMA
AND HE SAID GOOD LUCK
BY GOLLY HE SAID YOU'LL BE OUT OF HERE IN JUNE OF 51
HE SAID SON YOU'VE NEVER HAD A PLAN AND THEN HE SAID A FOOL WITH A PLAN CAN BEAT A
AND I'VE ENJOYED GIVING IT
AND SOMEBODY WOULD SAY ED PLAY UP
I'VE HAD THE MONEY TO GIVE
MY FIRST JOB WAS IN BARTLESVILLE
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF YOU'D HAVE BEEN FROM A SMALL TOWN
AND NOW UNUSUAL FOR MOST BOYS BUT NOW MY DAD WAS NOT ONLY MY
I'VE BEEN WEALTHY
THEY ALWAYS SAY IT'S THE BEST
BUT WE LOVE TO HAVE A BIG ONE
I'M AT THE POINT NOW WHERE I CAN'T HEAR OR SEE
THERE WASN'T ANYBODY STANDING BEHIND ME
I HAVE BEEN GENEROUS
OVER THE COURSE OF THE AKRON ART PRIZE I'VE LEARNED TO GET OUTSIDE OF MY OWN HEAD FOR A CHANGE AND THINK ABOUT
IT CAN BE ANY TYPE OF CHALLENGE
A RABBIT IN THE HEADLIGHTS
YOU THINK WHY ARE WE DESIGNED THAT WAY
NO THAT'S WRONG
IN THE CENTER OF THE CHEST
WHAT IS THE BIOLOGICAL CONTEXT FROM WHICH THOUGHT EMERGES
WHAT'S KIND OF INTERESTING ABOUT THAT IS WHEN THE BRAIN IS INHIBITED IT ALSO INHIBITS
YOU GO DEAF
YOU WERE RUBBISH
IT'S ESSENTIALLY A WAY TO MAKE A NATIONAL ORAL HISTORIES ARCHIVE ONE CONVERSATION AT A TIME
WE WANT PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE PEOPLE WHO HAVE OWNERSHIP
AND WALD'S WIDOW REQUESTED THAT THEY BE LISTED NEXT TO EACH OTHER
SO THE MEMORIAL OPENED IN 2011 AND THE MUSEUM'S GOING TO OPEN NEXT YEAR IN 2014
AND THE QUESTION IS WHO DO YOU WANT TO REMEMBER IF YOU HAD JUST 45 MINUTES WITH YOUR GRANDMOTHER
I'M GOING TO PLAY YOU JUST A COUPLE OF QUICK EXCERPTS FROM THE PROJECT
THE CHILD NODDED
HIS NAME WAS YAAKOV KRANTZ AND HE WAS REAL
AND IF GRIMM'S FAIRYTALES WERE NAMED ACCORDING TO AUTHOR RATHER THAN TO EDITOR THEN THEY'D BE CALLED SOMETHING LIKE
THERE ARE NO GRIMM'S FAIRYTALES
THAT REMINDS ME OF A STORY
WE TALK ABOUT GRIMM'S FAIRYTALES
AND THE KING SAID HOW DID YOU MANAGE IT
I HAPPENED TO BE COMP RING WHICH IS LIKE THE KISS OF DEATH TO SOMEBODY IN A JOB LIKE MINE
THE RABBI OF DUBNO WAS NOT A FICTIONAL CHARACTER
AND THAT'S IMPORTANT
IT'S A REMINDER
IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG YOU HAVE NO POWER BUT ALL THE RESPONSIBILITY AS THE COMP RE
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE FIND IN THE STORY IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE BRING TO THE STORY
UNDERNEATH WE ARE THE SAME
HE KNEW HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF THEM HE REALLY GENUINELY DID AND HIS STORIES WENT INTO
BECAUSE I KNEW THAT I HAD FAILED
AND I HAD TO SIT DOWN AND ASK MYSELF WHY
THE GRIMMS DIDN'T TELL ANY FAIRYTALES
AND AT THE CENTER OF EVERY TARGET WAS AN ARROW
SO I DECIDED THE FIRST THING I COULD DO WAS TELL THEM A STORY ABOUT STORYTELLING
SOMEBODY ASKED HIM ONCE HOW HE MANAGED IT AND HIS ANSWER WAS THIS
AND THE STORY WAS SIMPLY THIS
AND I FINISHED 20 MINUTES EARLY
AND I LOOKED FOR THAT POSSIBILITY AND THE POSSIBILITY WAS PERSONAL FREEDOM
REMEMBER THE HAND
WE HAVE SEEN THIS QUESTION SEVERAL TIMES WHY
OF LYING IMMENSIVELY TO YOUR FRIENDS TO YOUR FAMILY AND IN MANY CASES TO YOURSELF JUST
BUT TODAY'S GENERATION WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY BE HONEST ABOUT WHO WE ARE
THAT WAS WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO DO
HOW CAN WE GO TO A GREATER BATTLE
I USED TO THINK WELL IS IT CAMBODIA
THEY WERE TORTURING EVERYBODY ALL THE TIME
HE WAS BORN IN A PRISON WITH ALMOST NOTHING NO MATERIAL GOODS BUT HE HAD A SENSE OF HIS OWN HEROIC JOURNEY WHICH I
OR A WOMAN I PICKED UP HER BABY REALLY CUTE BABY I SAID YOUR BABY IS SO CUTE
IT HAD EVERYTHING IN IT
AND MOST OF THE PRISONERS SAID THAT HE WAS THEIR GREATEST JOY AND THEIR SUNSHINE AND THEY LOOKED FORWARD TO HIM
AND WHEN THEY BROUGHT HER CASE TO THE JUDGE FOR THE FIRST TIME HE STOOD UP AND HE SAID YES THERE'S NO EVIDENCE
THIS IS FANTASTIC
OR IS IT OTHER COUNTRIES
AND THEY SHOWED ME A MANUAL WHICH ACTUALLY WAS AN EXCELLENT MANUAL
SO LAWYERS BEGAN TO COURAGEOUSLY STAND UP TOGETHER TO ORGANIZE A SYSTEM WHERE THEY CAN TAKE CASES
WHAT CAN WE DO
I SAID I'M GONNA COPY THIS
IT WAS PERFECT
SO IT'S AN ONLINE CONTEST WHERE IT'S ONLY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IF YOU COME UP WITH AND INNOVATIVE WAY OF IMPLEMENTING
WHAT'S GOING ON
IT WASN'T A BABY SHE WAS THREE
A JUDGE WOULD LET HER OUT
AND AFTER A PAUSE THEY SAID THEY HAD BEEN TORTURED
WE HAVE A PROGRAM CALLED JUSTICEMAKERS AND WE REALIZED THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE COURAGEOUS AND WANT TO DO THINGS
BUT CAMBODIA IS NOT ALONE
SO IT'S JUST A PLACE WHERE THERE WAS NO RULE OF LAW
SHE WAS PREGNANT AT THE TIME
SHE HAD CIGARETTE BURNS ON HER
BUT I'M ONE
BUT I SAID TO THEM I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION WHICH IS BY THE TIME THAT EVERYBODY GOT TO THE PROSECUTOR'S
WHAT IF I LIVE TO BE A 100
IF YOU MOVE AT ALL WHILE WE'RE TAKING THE PICTURE ALL WE SEE IS A BLUR
AND THAT WAS OKAY BECAUSE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM SAID THIS WHOLE THING WAS DOOMED ANYWAY FMRI ING BABIES IS OBVIOUSLY
SO I SUGGEST THAT IF WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE HUMAN MIND WE HAVE TO START AT THE BEGINNING AND STUDY THE BRAINS OF BABIES
I STUDY HUMAN BRAIN DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE I WANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE HUMAN MIND IS BUILT AND MAYBE BE ABLE TO HELP FIX
NOW HUMAN BABIES ARE A HARD POPULATION TO STUDY AT THE BEST OF TIMES
NOW I STARTED THIS TALK WITH A PARADOX
THERE WILL BE JOBS
WHY DOESN'T THAT MAKE OUR LABOR SUPERFLUOUS OUR SKILLS REDUNDANT
DOES THAT MEAN THERE'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT
TODAY IT'S LESS THAN TWO PERCENT
WHY ARE THERE SO FEW FARMERS TODAY
MANY OF THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE NOW WORK
AND I WAS RACKING MY BRAINS AND FORTUNATELY SOMEONE HERE IN THE AUDIENCE SAVED ME BECAUSE I WAS LOOKING AT THE BOARDS THAT ARE
AND I WOULD LOVE NOW TO START A CONVERSATION WHERE WE COULD TALK ABOUT OUR FAVORITE STORIES AND EXCHANGE THE REASONS
HE SAID YOU KNOW WE WERE SO FOCUSED ON THE MOUNTAIN BACK THEN
YOU CAN STILL RUN INTO A BEAR AND BE SPEAKING WITH IT
WHEN YOU WATCH KIDS IT'S NOT JUST ALL BLOOD AND GUTS
WHAT ABOUT THOSE LANGUAGES THAT TELL US HOW TO MOVE ON THE GROUND HOW TO FOLLOW
GO OUT THERE
THE CRACKS WERE MY ROUTES THE MAP WAS ONE TO ONE THE LAND ITSELF WAS THE MAP I
WE SPEND SO MUCH TIME MAKING THE LAND ADJUST TO US MAKING THE WORLD CHANGE FOR
IT'S SAYING I'M VERY INTERESTED IN YOU
WE NEED TO TRAVEL OUT THERE AND WE DON'T HAVE TO SUFFER OUT THERE
THAT'S ALL IT TAKES
I WANT TO SEE HOW THE SUNRISE AFFECTS THIS CANYON IN A DIFFERENT WAY EVERY TIME
IT DIDN'T RUN TOO FAR IT RAN MAYBE ANOTHER 20 FEET TURNED AROUND AND STOOD ON ITS HIND LEGS JUST TO GET A
JASPER SAID CAN I TAKE A PICTURE OF IT
EVERY NEXT STEP IS A POSSIBILITY WHERE YOU HAVE TO DECIDE YOU HAVE TO MAKE THAT CHOICE
WE OPEN THE DOORS OUTSIDE AND THE WORLD CHANGES
IT BECOMES POSSIBLE IN A WAY THAT JUST CAN'T HAPPEN INDOORS
TO A PLACE THAT IS MORE THAN HUMAN
BUILD UP THAT LANGUAGE ENTER THAT WORLD
NOT A LOT OF COOL SEXY STUFF HAPPENING IN DENTISTRY
BECAUSE WE KNOW
THERE'S AN EMOTIONAL CONNECTION TO INFORMATION BECAUSE IT'S FROM US
PEOPLE BRUSH AND FLOSS THEIR TEETH
AND THIS INFORMATION IS OUT THERE
THEY GO RIGHT TO DOCTORS
AND THE PEOPLE WHO SAID YEAH YEAH
IT'S DIFFERENT FROM COMPLIANCE
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO WADE THROUGH IT
BUT IT ACTUALLY HITS HOME
I MEAN THEY COMPLAIN ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME
AGAIN BANDURA RECOGNIZED THIS YEARS AGO DECADES AGO
IT'S THE ONE GREAT PREVENTIVE HEALTH SUCCESS WE HAVE IN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM
IF YOU GET GUM DISEASE YOU WILL LOSE YOUR TEETH BUT YOU'LL GET DENTURES AND IT WON'T BE THAT BAD
THEY WANTED TO TELL THEM HOW BAD IT WOULD BE IF THEY DIDN'T BRUSH AND FLOSS THEIR TEETH
YOU CAN START TO UNPACK THE CHOICES INVOLVED BECAUSE OF THE SIDE EFFECTS
SO THESE CONNECTICUT DENTISTS DECIDED THAT THEY WANTED TO GET PEOPLE TO BRUSH THEIR TEETH AND FLOSS THEIR TEETH MORE OFTEN AND
IT WORKS TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE WAY WE TALK ABOUT BEHAVIOR IN MEDICINE TODAY
SO THAT WAS THE LOW FEAR GROUP
IT WAS THE SENSE OF EFFICACY
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT THE BENEFITS ARE
IT SHOULD BE THE PATIENT
FEAR DOESN'T WORK
THEN WE USE THE INFORMATION THAT'S ALREADY IN THE LAB REPORT
IT'S JUST SITTING THERE
WE TELL YOU THAT YOU'RE OKAY YOU'RE NORMAL
BUT YOU CAN CREATE YOUR OWN FEEDBACK LOOP
THEY DIVIDED THEM UP INTO TWO GROUPS
IT'S AN INCREDIBLY POWERFUL CATALYST TO CHANGE
THEY DON'T DO IT AS MUCH AS THEY SHOULD BUT THEY DO IT
SO THIS IS AN OLD EXPERIMENT BUT IT'S A REALLY GOOD ONE BECAUSE IT WAS VERY SIMPLE SO IT'S AN EASY STORY TO TELL
BUT THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF OTHER BODIES OF INFORMATION THAT ARE COMING ONLINE AND WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THE CAPACITY OF THIS INFORMATION
WHO AMONG US WOULD ACTUALLY SAY THAT PEOPLE READ THIS
SO FEAR DOESN'T WORK RIGHT
IT'S NOT JUST HITTING US IN OUR HEADS IT'S HITTING US IN OUR HEARTS
WE AGAIN PERSONALIZED THE RISKS
WE TALK ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF ENGAGEMENT OR NON COMPLIANCE
THESE THINGS ARE SHOWN TO BE PRETTY EFFECTIVE IN TERMS OF GETTING PEOPLE TO SLOW DOWN
THEY REDUCE SPEEDS BY ABOUT FIVE TO 10 PERCENT
SO THIS PATIENT IS IN THEIR 50S SO WE CAN ACTUALLY GIVE THEM A VERY PRECISE ESTIMATE OF WHAT THEIR RISK FOR PROSTATE
ANYBODY CAN CREATE THEIR FEEDBACK LOOP BY ASKING THESE SIMPLE QUESTIONS CAN I HAVE MY RESULTS
IT GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO ARISTOTLE
BUT WE'RE NOT USING IT
IT'S THE PERSON WHO ACTUALLY IN THE END IS GOING TO BE HAVING TO CHANGE THEIR LIVES AND THEN START ADOPTING NEW
IT'S AN AMAZING NOTION
IT'S ABOUT THOSE TINY LITTLE DECISIONS YOU KNOW LIKE WHEN YOU ARE SITTING AT YOUR DESK PUTTING IN JUST A LITTLE EXTRA TIME
YOU WRAP THESE PUBLIC STRUCTURES WITH YARN
WHY AM I STOPPING AT SEVEN INCHES
THAT'S NOT WHAT IT'S ABOUT
SO WHAT OTHER BIG AMBITIOUS GOALS I'VE BEEN HOLDING ONTO PUTTING OFF UNTIL RETIREMENT THAT I
BUT THE TYPE OF MARGINAL IMPROVEMENTS THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT ARE EASILY ACHIEVABLE BY EVERY SINGLE ONE OF
I WOULD BREAK IT DOWN INTO THESE TASKS THAT I COULD ACHIEVE THAT WOULD REQUIRE ME TO FOCUS FOR JUST
AND I WENT TO BERLIN FOR A 16 DAY INTENSIVE GERMAN COURSE
AND THEN HE STARTED READING ENCYCLOPEDIAS FROM COVER TO COVER
IT WAS A VERY BASIC REACTION TO FIND SOME REASON WE CAN DO THIS
WE TOOK IT INTO THE SCANNER TO SEE HOW BRAINS RESPOND WHEN YOU HEAR LAUGHTER
SO I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THIS IN MORE DETAIL
WE'RE GOING TO GET THROUGH THIS
THAT WOULD BE STRESSFUL
WHEN YOU START LAUGHING HARD YOU START SQUEEZING AIR OUT FROM YOUR LUNGS UNDER MUCH HIGHER PRESSURES THAN YOU COULD
WE'RE GOING TO BE OKAY
WE CAN LAUGH TOGETHER
NOW I DON'T THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE LIMITED TO ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS
SO IF YOU ASK HUMAN BEINGS WHEN DO YOU LAUGH
IT'S MUCH MORE LIKE AN ANIMAL CALL THAN IT IS LIKE SPEECH
SO HERE WE'VE GOT SOME LAUGHTER FOR YOU
THIS IS WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL
SO I FIGURED I HAD TO KNOCK IT ON THE HEAD
NOBODY IS GOING TO ASK YOU TO TAKE A MATH TEST IN A BATHING SUIT
SO ON THE AP CALCULUS EXAM RESEARCH FINDS THAT IF WE PUT THAT CHECKBOX AT THE TOP
I KNEW I HAD TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT THIS
YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FOOD
BUT AT THE SAME WHILE WE ARE BLIND TO MANY THINGS AND WE DON'T SEE
YOU GO SEARCH FOR THE INGREDIENTS ACCORDINGLY
LET'S WATCH THIS TOGETHER
SO IT S TIME TO WAKE UP AND CHANGE
AND THE FOOD SYSTEM IS A GOOD PLACE TO START WITH
SO WHAT DID WE DO
NOW IMAGINE WHAT YOU COULD BE DOING WITH THE MONEY THAT YOU JUST WASTED
IT'S NOT FOOD FROM THE GARBAGE
SO WE TOOK IT FROM THE SELLERS AND WE STARTED WORKING AND COOKING
WHERE IS THE PROBLEM
HANDS ON HEARTS HOW MUCH FOOD DO YOU THINK YOU'RE THROWING
NOW THAT WAS YOU AT YOUR HOUSE
BUT WHY IS IT THAT IT'S SUCH A HUGE PROBLEM
IT WOULD BE JUST TOO DEPRESSING
WELL THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS
AND LET ME GO BACK TO THAT IMAGE OF THE MEDITERRANEAN
THE LAST ONE'S A PERSONAL QUESTION
NOW I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE DISAGREEMENT IS REALLY ONE OF SEMANTICS
AND IT'S NOT JUST WILDLIFE
GET COMFORTABLE WITH BEING UNCOMFORTABLE
I WENT FROM DRIVING ON THE LEFT SIDE TO DRIVING ON THE RIGHT
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU MY STORY
AND ONCE SOMETHING'S IN THE COMMONS IT WILL ALWAYS BE THERE
IT STRIKES ME THAT WE TALK VERY DEEPLY ABOUT DESIGN BUT ACTUALLY THERE'S AN ECONOMICS BEHIND ARCHITECTURE THAT WE
WHICH IS APPROPRIATE BECAUSE ACTUALLY THIS APPROACH IS NOT INNOVATIVE
INSTEAD GET RID OF THE SCHOOL BELL
HOW WILL FINANCE DEVELOPMENT
HOW WILL WE SELL DESIGN SERVICES
AND WE COULD HAVE A WAY OF CANCER SELF DESTRUCTING
I ALSO PROMISED I WAS GOING TO TALK ABOUT CANCER
OK SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM
AND IT'S NOT JUST ALZHEIMER'S
THE PROBLEM IS THOUGH THAT PROTEINS DON'T ALWAYS FOLD PROPERLY
WHY THEN DO CELLS EVER HAVE PROBLEMS
AND THEN THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE A CHANCE TO ARTICULATE THEIR ANSWER ORALLY
SO I CREATED SOME NEW IN CLASS ACTIVITIES
I WAS SOLD AND FROM GRAD SCHOOL ON I DEDICATED ALMOST ALL MY ENERGY TO
WE ARE GOING YO USE THIS THING CALLED THE ONLINE BULLETIN BOARD FOR DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE GOING TO GO ON
FINALLY BECAUSE IT'S ONLINE IT'S PRESERVED AND STUDENTS CAN USE THOSE HISTORIC DISCUSSIONS TO
SO WHILE I'M TEACHING CLASSES NOWADAYS MY LMS WILL NOTIFY ME WHEN THERE ARE NEW ASSIGNMENTS I NEED TO GRADE
AND I FELT REALLY BAD ABOUT IT
LET ME BE THE GUINEA PIG AND SHOW YOU HOW IT'S DONE RIGHT
THAT IS ALL
YOU GUYS PROBABLY ALL USE AN ONLINE CALENDAR TO HELP YOU GET TO PHYSICAL
SO LET'S FAST FORWARD A DECADE
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS AT THE UNIVERSITY FOR QUITE SOME TIME
YOU ARE GOING TO CALL ON MAYBE ONE OR TWO OF THEM WHOEVER YOU MAY NOTICE
I STARTED OFF OK
AND I WAS RIGHT
UP UNTIL THAT TIME I'D REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT ONLINE EDUCATION IN TERMS OF
WE'RE BACK WHERE WE WERE IN THE 1970S
WE'LL PICK IT UP
NO MORE ARE WE GOING TO ACCEPT THIS
AND THE FOOD BANKS ARE GROWING
WE'LL MAKE SURE IT'S STORED PROPERLY
THE SHOPKEEPERS ARE HIRING MORE PEOPLE
PEOPLE HAVE TO EAT
WELL GUESS WHAT
WELL I FIND PARENTS OUT ON THE FRONT LINES VERY AWARE THEIR CHILDREN
AND I'M SURE THOSE ARCHITECTS ARE INSPIRED AS I AM BY WHAT SURROUNDS US BY NATURE
AND THIS IS QUITE A GOOD WAY OF DOING IT
I'M ALSO WORKING NOW WITH X RAY VIDEO
IS ACTUALLY CALLED THE VULVA
SO I'D LIKE TO TRY IT AGAIN
SO THAT TIME WAS PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT EASIER THAN THE FIRST BUT I'D LIKE TO TRY IT AGAIN JUST TWICE MORE
WE SOMETIMES MISTAKENLY CALL THE ENTIRE GENITAL REGION THE VAGINA BUT REALLY THIS IS
WHY DON'T WE TURN PRISONS INTO SCHOOLS
IN MY EXPERIENCE LACK OF EDUCATION IS AT THE HEART OF THE MANY PROBLEMS THAT LEAD TO PRISON
I SAID TURN PRISONS INTO SCHOOLS
THE ICE TOO MAKE SOUNDS
YOU MAY WELL HAVE HEARD THAT A DECREASE IN SEASONAL SEA ICE IS CAUSING LOSS OF HABITAT FOR ANIMALS THAT RELY
THIS OFFERS US A NEW OPPORTUNITY
WELL THE THING ABOUT THESE SEX STEM CELLS IN BIRDS IS THAT THEY'RE PROMISCUOUS
AND WE IMPLANT THAT IN
WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENT SORT OF FROZEN ZOO
IN THIS CASE FROM THE PASSENGER PIGEON INTO THE BAND TAILED PIGEON
WE GROW UP THAT SURROGATE HOST UNTIL IT BECOMES AN ADULT COCKEREL
AND THEY MIGRATE THROUGH THE EMBRYO TO COLONIZE THE GONAD
SO THEN WHAT WE CAN DO WITH THESE CELLS IN CULTURE IS THAT WE CAN ADD A GENE TO MARK THEM
IN THIS CASE GREEN FLUORESCENT PROTEIN
YOU ALL HAVE THE POWER TO DO THAT
AND I LOOKED AT HIM AND HIS EYES WELLED UP WITH TEARS AND HE SAID MAN THESE PEOPLE DON'T
WHAT A POWERFUL MESSAGE TO SEND TO A YOUNG PERSON
I WOULDN'T BE STANDING HERE PROUDLY TODAY HAD OTHERS NOT BELIEVED IN ME AND SHOWN ME THE WAY
IT'S WHAT YOU WERE EXPOSED TO AS A YOUNG CHILD
INDIVIDUALS LIKE MY FIRST GRADE TEACHER WHO ALWAYS TOLD ME HOW SMART I WAS AND HOW LUCKY
I WANT SOMEONE TO LOVE ME MAKE ME FEEL LIKE I MATTER MAKE ME BELIEVE I CAN BE SOMEBODY INSTEAD OF MAKING ME
HE STARTED PACING BACK AND FORTH AND I ASKED HIM WHAT'S GOING ON
AND LATER THAT DAY THAT STUDENT CAME DOWN TO MY OFFICE JUST COMPLETELY UPSET
AND I AM PROOF OF THAT
SO AS MAHATMA GANDHI SAID BE THE CHANGE THAT YOU WISH TO SEE IN THE WORLD
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE A NICE CHRISTMAS
IT'S ABOUT HELPING PEOPLE ACHIEVE THE GOALS THAT THEY WANT TO ACHIEVE AND NOT DETERMINING WHAT THEIR GOALS SHOULD
IT WAS A COUPLE WEEKS BEFORE THE WINTER HOLIDAYS AND A COLLEAGUE CAME FORWARD
SHE WANTED TO BE AN ADVOCATE FOR THOSE SHE CONSIDERED VOICELESS BECAUSE SHE SAID THEIR NEEDS
IT WAS ALREADY YOUR LIVED EXPERIENCE
AND I'M TALKING STRAIGHT UP WELFARE
MONTHLY CASH ASSISTANCE HOUSING ALLOWANCE FOOD STAMPS WEEKLY TRIPS TO THE FOOD
IT'S THE KIND OF LIFE YOU EXPECTED
AND THAT IS TRULY HOW I LIVE MY LIFE BOTH PERSONALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY
BOHR SAID TO WOLFGANG PAULI AFTER HIS PRESENTATION OF HEISENBERG'S AND PAULI'S NON LINEAR FIELD THEORY OF
LOOK WHAT WOMEN AND DARK MATTER HAVE IN COMMON
ONE OF THESE PERPLEXITIES WAS THE EVOLUTION OF WOMEN AS A SO CALLED SUBSTANDARD
AND I ASK BACK AT YOU WHY NOT
LIKE THAT COMET THAT TRANSFORMED AND UPSET OUR WORLD FOREVER SO TOO WILL WOMEN CREATE CHANGE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN
IT CONNECTS IT GOES TWO WAYS MANY WAYS AN EXCHANGE A NETWORK
THE FACT THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OUR WORLD HISTORY A FEMALE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE LOST DOES NOT
WHILE DARK MATTER CAPTURED THE WORLD'S IMAGINATION OVERNIGHT IT REMAINS ONE OF THE GREATEST UNSOLVED MYSTERIES OF ALL
LET'S TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT WHAT YOU CANNOT SEE
DARK MATTER IS UNLIKE ANYTHING WE'VE EVER SEEN
SO THERE'S A TERM FOR THIS AND IT'S CALLED THE IMPOSTOR SYNDROME
IN FACT WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL MY GEOMETRY TEACHER WOULD ACTUALLY LET ME TEACH CLASS FOR HER IF SHE WAS GOING TO BE GONE
THE ROLE MODEL PIECE IS SO IMPORTANT
AND WHAT IF SOMEBODY FINDS OUT THAT I DON'T DESERVE TO BE HERE
THAT'S ONE MILLION ON TOP OF THE PROJECTED THREE MILLION
I JUST GAVE IT AWAY
I ALSO REALLY LOVED MATH
DMITRY GERASHCHENKO FROM HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL
I'M GOING TO DEMO THIS SOUND FOR YOU RIGHT NOW
THAT SOUND PATTERN ACTUALLY PRIMES YOUR MIND TO HAVE MORE OF THESE REGENERATIVE DELTA WAVES
ACTUALLY YOU'RE LOOKING AT A GUY WHO HAS THE BEST JOB IN THE WORLD
ACTUALLY IT WAS A VERY HARD CHALLENGE
WHEN YOU HAVE 3
YOU CAN FIND ORIGINAL WAYS TO GET THINGS DONE
COM A WEBSITE AND ALL YOU HAD TO DO IN THOSE DAYS WAS BE A WEBSITE HAVE DOT COM' IN YOUR NAME IF FORBES
THEN THE CRASH CAME OH MY GOSH
ONLY 3 OF PEOPLE IN POVERTY HAVE JOBS
BUT WELL AS I SAID I MEAN CAR DRIVERS ADAPT RIGHT
IT'S BECAUSE THAT TRAVEL PATTERNS ARE MUCH LESS STABLE THAN YOU MIGHT THINK
AND WHY IS THAT
EACH DAY PEOPLE MAKE NEW DECISIONS AND PEOPLE CHANGE AND THE WORLD CHANGES AROUND THEM AND EACH DAY ALL OF
YOU REALLY REDUCE CONGESTION QUITE SUBSTANTIALLY
I MEAN IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED SYSTEM
SOMEONE MUST CONTROL ALL OF THIS
NO ONE IS IN CHARGE
I MEAN HE REALLY WAS JUST A MINOR CHARACTER IN ALL OF THE FAIRY TALES
IT IS GOING TO TAKE GENERATIONS TO CHANGE
THEY'RE ALWAYS MISERABLE IT'S ALWAYS SOMEONE ELSE'S FAULT THEY'RE REALLY CONFRONTATIONAL AND THEY'RE ALWAYS THE VICTIM
I DIDN'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS AND IT'S HAUNTED ME EVER SINCE
YOU FEEL GOOD THEY FEEL GOOD
AND SECONDLY IT'S NOT ABOUT BEING A PRINCESS
AND AS WE ALL KNOW THERE ARE ONLY TWO THINGS GUARANTEED IN LIFE
SHE WAS VERY VERY CONTENT
BRONNIE WAS A PALLIATIVE CARE NURSE SO THESE AREN'T HER REGRETS OF DYING
THIS ORGANIZATION IS A LOT BIGGER THAN ANY I'VE EVER WORKED FOR MAYBE I NEED TO BE MORE SERIOUS
THE EVIL QUEEN HOWEVER RESORTED TO POISONING SNOW WHITE TO TRY AND GET HER HAPPY ENDING WHICH WE
HE SAID TO THE FISHERMAN HOW MANY FISH DID YOU CATCH
IT'S REALLY NICE ISN'T IT
THESE ARE THE REGRETS SHE HEARS FROM HER PATIENTS AT THEIR HOUR OF DEATH
BUT WHAT IF WE WERE ALREADY GIVEN THE MAP TO HAPPINESS BUT LIFE GOT IN THE WAY AND WE FORGOT
ALL I WANTED TO DO IS TELL HIM HOW MUCH I LOVED HIM AND WHAT AN AMAZING FRIEND HE WAS
HE WAS THE OUTCOME OF HAPPINESS NOT THE SOURCE
FOR ME WHEN I FIRST GOT THE JOB I'M IN AT THE MOMENT THE CHANCELLOR CAME UP TO ME BEFORE I STARTED AND SAID
HAVE WE REALLY JUST SET UP THESE SERIES OF EXPECTATIONS FOR OURSELVES AND WHO'S JUDGING US
SHE WAS NOT LOOKING FOR ANYTHING MORE THAN SHE HAD
ALTHOUGH IT WASN'T SOMETHING THAT WE WERE COMFORTABLE WITH AS WOMEN IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE LEARNED AND WE
AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT I BLAME
WHEN I WAS IN MY 20S A REALLY GOOD FRIEND OF MINE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH TERMINAL CANCER AND I WAS LIVING AWAY
SO SOMETIMES TRYING TO FORCE YOURSELF OFF YOUR PATH CAN ACTUALLY PUT YOU ONTO THE WRONG
I THOUGHT OH MY GOD MAYBE HE'S RIGHT
OF COURSE I TURN UP TO THE WORK ON THE FIRST DAY WITH THIS INTENTION TO BE MORE SERIOUS AND BY LUNCHTIME I WAS
THEY COULD BE SO MUCH MORE IF THEY JUST CONSIDERED PEOPLE AROUND THEM
THEY WERE PROUD ABOUT WHAT THEY DID SO SOMETIMES WE NEED TO STOP LOOKING FOR EXTERNAL VALIDATION
IT LOWERS ANXIETY IT LOWERS STRESS IT IMPROVES YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM BY INCREASING YOUR WHITE BLOOD CELLS
HE SAID JUST A FEW
IT'S NOT ABOUT MAKING PEOPLE FEEL BAD TO MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER BECAUSE THAT'S ONLY SHORT TERM
I HEARD OF A STORY RECENTLY WHICH I THINK IS A REALLY GOOD DEPICTION OF THIS
I BLAME TIME
IT'S ABOUT MAKING OTHER PEOPLE FEEL COMFORTABLE
THE REALITY IS IN THE DECADE TODAY IT'S NOT GOING TO CUT IT
THE FIRST REGRET
IF YOU NEVER THINK YOU'RE GOING TO BE HAPPY YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO BE HAPPY
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS BUT WE SEEM TO WEAR IT LIKE A BADGE OF HONOR
BUT NOWADAYS THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS THAT WE CAN BE SO THE PRINCESS REALLY IS AN IDEOLOGY
THERE'S A BOOK OUT AT THE MOMENT CALLED THE FIVE REGRETS OF DYING BY AUSTRALIAN AUTHOR BRONNIE WARE
IT'S GOT HEALTH BENEFITS
FOR ME I THINK WE MAY HAVE LOST SIGHT OF WHERE IT ALL STARTED
I WISH I'D LET MYSELF BE HAPPIER
IT'S NOT ABOUT FINDING A HANDSOME PRINCE
BUT I CAME HOME AND I SAW HIM SHORTLY BEFORE HE DIED
IF WE LOOK AT CULTURES AROUND THE WORLD EVERY CULTURE READS STORIES
THEY'RE MORE THAN JUST MYTHS LEGENDS AND FABLES
THE SECOND ONE
IF WE LOOK AT SNOW WHITE SHE HAD TO CLEAN THE HOUSE OF SEVEN STINKY COAL MINERS AND AS WE ALL KNOW IT'S HARD ENOUGH
I MEAN WHEN THE PRINCE FOUND THE GLASS SLIPPER CINDERELLA DIDN'T RACE TO THE PALACE DEMANDING TO
YOU KNOW THIS PERSON IN THE WORKFORCE
THEY ARE THE ORAL TEXTBOOKS OF THE CULTURE DESIGNED TO IMPART WISDOM SPIRITUALITY
BUT I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT TANGIBLE GIVING
WE ALL KNOW THE SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY
THE GOOD THING IS THAT SMILING ACTUALLY HAS SOME GREAT BENEFITS
LIKE NOW YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT LIKE YOU GOTTA GET ON WITH THAT
AND THEN I THINK NO THIS IS THE NEW YORK CITY SUBWAY
AND THEY DO IT BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION
IT'S ABOUT JUSTICE
SO WHAT I'VE DONE IS CREATED A HIGHLY SCIENTIFIC TAXONOMY OF HATERS
THIS IS THE GROUP I LIKE TO TARGET WITH SOCIAL JUSTICE COMEDY
BUT THEY JUST DON'T MAKE THEM LIKE THEY USED TO WHICH IS ANOTHER SIGN OF THE DECLINE IN AMERICA
SOMETIMES I GET MEAN TWEETS AND HATE MAIL
SOMETIMES I GET VOICE MAILS SAYING THAT IF I CONTINUE TELLING MY JOKES THEY'LL KILL
AND THOSE DEATH THREATS ARE DEFINITELY NOT FUNNY
WHAT IF WE COULD GET WASTED ON WASTE
THE DAY THAT THERE'S NO MORE WASTE BREAD TO BE BREWED IS THE DAY THAT WE CAN SHUT UP SHOP AND
WE SOURCE OUR BREAD FROM SANDWICH MANUFACTURERS WHERE THE HEEL OF A LOAF OF BREAD THE CRUST OF A LOAF
AND QUITE RIGHT TOO
WE WANT TO BREW AS MUCH OF THAT BREAD THAT WOULD OTHERWISE GO TO WASTE AS POSSIBLE
WE'VE COLLABORATED WITH BREWERIES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY TO CREATE NEW BREAD BEERS AND TACKLE BREAD WASTE AT A
BUT WE'RE NOT DONE YET
FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS I'VE BEEN THE UK COUNTRY DIRECTOR FOR AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATION CALLED
THE FINAL THING THAT WE DO
TRISTRAM FOUNDED FEEDBACK AND FEEDBACK HAS CHANGED GOVERNMENT POLICY THEY'VE LAUNCHED
ONE THIRD OF THE FOOD THAT WE PRODUCE IN THE WORLD IS GOING TO WASTE
I MUST HAVE SEEN THOUSANDS OF IDEAS OVER THE YEARS AND I'VE DONE MY BEST TO HELP WHEREVER I CAN
THEN 18 MONTHS AGO I GOT CHATTING TO ONE OF THE CHANGE MAKERS WITHIN THE NETWORK CALLED TRISTRAM
HE'S PIONEERED THE FIGHT AGAINST FOOD WASTE
SO LIKE IN REAL LIFE WHEN THE PROTAGONIST DIES ALONE IN THE ARCTIC MAYBE GETS EATEN BY A
I STILL BARELY UNDERSTAND WHAT MOST SCIENTISTS ARE TALKING ABOUT
AND SO I HOPE AT THESE MEETINGS THAT THERE WILL BE A ROLE FOR THE PUBLIC TO BRING THEIR VOICE TO BEAR AS
IT'S A TOUGH QUESTION
WHAT IS BETTER WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A HUMAN BEING
AND IN FACT TO SOME EXTENT YOU'RE RIGHT
THEY'RE STUDYING HUMAN DISEASE AND OTHER IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF SCIENCE
SO THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD RESEARCH GOING ON WITH CRISPR
SF ALSO GIVES SHAPE AND FORM TO PEOPLE
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN A HUNTER MIGHT SAY
IT'S A PRETTY AMAZING WAY
THEY'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT THE PAST THEY'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE
I WAS ALWAYS AFFIRMED
I CAN TELL HOW IT'S GOING TO FIGHT ON THE WAY UP OR NOT
I COULD FEEL THE SEA LION COMING BEFORE IT CAME
I'M GOING TO BE LIKE THE BIRDS
I CAN TELL YOU GENERALLY IF IT'S MALE OR FEMALE I CAN TELL YOU WHAT SIZE IT IS
IN THIS FIELD OF AWARENESS
AND I'M SAYING IN MY CHILD MIND
NOT THE WAY THAT I WAS RAISED
YOU KNOW IT'S VERY INTERESTING BEING UP HERE
WHEN I WAS A CHILD 1
I WAS NEVER IGNORED
ALL THE OTHERS DO DAY IN AND DAY OUT IS SEARCH FOR MONEY
AND THERE ARE THREE MAIN STAGES
IT WAS INTRODUCED ONLY IN THE UNITED STATES
THAT MEANS THAT IT HAS A PRIVILEGE THAT OTHER COUNTRIES DO NOT HAVE
IT WAS A PSYCHIATRIST
AND ABOVE ALL IT'S NOT GOING TO BE BORING
ECONOMY BECAUSE THE BULK OF THE MONEY WAS DENOMINATED IN U
SHE ALSO EMBRACED VIOLENCE
ONCE FOR EXAMPLE I WAS INTERVIEWING THIS PART TIMER FROM THE RED BRIGADES
THIS IS WHEN THE TWO SUPERPOWERS WERE FIGHTING A WAR BY PROXY ALONG THE PERIPHERY OF THE SPHERE
YOU KNOW THAT WOMAN THAT GOES AROUND TO FOUNDATIONS ASKING FOR MONEY THINKING ABOUT THE ECONOMICS OF TERRORISM
AND THEY DREW A LIST OF PEOPLE WITH WHOM THEY WOULD TALK AND TELL THEIR STORY
BUT ALSO THAT IS ABLE TO CARRY OUT ATTACKS IN MORE THAN ONE COUNTRY
IT'S GOING TO BE FRIGHTFUL BUT IT'S GOING TO ENLIGHTEN YOU
IT COMES BACK AT TIMES OF GREAT TRANSFORMATION GLOBALIZATION BEING ONE OF THOSE TRANSFORMATIONS
NOBODY WANTS THE U
WHY DID THIS HAPPEN
SO STATE SPONSOR OF TERRORISM FEATURE OF THE COLD WAR
HE WAS A REALLY KEEN SAILOR
AND HE TOLD ME THAT THE BEST TIME OF HIS LIFE WAS WHEN HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE RED BRIGADES AND HE WENT SAILING EVERY
AND IT WAS INTRODUCED ONLY FOR THE U
SO WHAT IS ROGUE ECONOMICS
WHAT DOES IT MEAN
BECAUSE THEY HAD NO IDEA
AND I WAS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE
WHEN I ASKED MY FRIEND WHY THE RED BRIGADES WANT TO TALK TO ME HE SAID THAT THE FEMALE MEMBERS
THIS HAPPENED BECAUSE THE PATRIOT ACT WAS A UNILATERAL LEGISLATION
NOW I FOUND THE ANSWER VERY QUICKLY
AND THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE DID
NOW DEREGULATION ALSO BROUGHT BACK ROGUE ECONOMICS
CAN WE DO THE EVEN HARDER THING
I MEAN I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN TO HIM
SO THANK YOU
SO WE WENT TO THE FINANCE INDUSTRY
ALL OF OUR STATUSES ARE DIFFERENT
ALL OF OUR HOPES AND DREAMS WHAT WE WANT TO ACCOMPLISH IS DIFFERENT AND OUR PATHS WILL BE DIFFERENT THEY ARE ALL STORIES
WE WERE AT THE BEACH HE WAS RAISING HIS SON AND HE WAS PRODUCTIVE
ARE THERE OTHER PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING THIS
HOW CAN WE CONNECT THIS
AND WHAT ENDED UP HAPPENING HE STARTED A FEW CONFERENCE CALLS
HOW TO TACKLE HOMOPHOBIA
SO SOMEBODY MAKING A GATE FOR EXAMPLE OUT OF METAL MAY TAKE A WEEK TO MAKE JUST ONE GATE BUT WITH THIS MACHINE THEY MIGHT
SHE'S NOT AN ENGINEER
SO THIS WAS DESIGNED BY MY HEAD OF ENGINEERING
SO THE SIGNIFICANCE HERE IS THAT THE PILOTING PROCESS IS POSSIBLE
SO IN KENYA RIGHT NOW WE HAVE VOLKSWAGEN PEUGEOT RENAULT WE HAVE MERCEDES DOING LORRIES AND WE'VE ALSO GOT
SHE WAS ABLE TO ENGAGE PEOPLE IN OUR SPACE TO BE ABLE TO HELP HER TO DO THIS AND SHE'S OFF AND RUNNING NOW WITH A BUSINESS
WE HAVE LOTS OF DISCUSSIONS IN OUR SPACE AROUND WHO WE WERE AS AFRICANS WHO WE ARE TODAY AND WHO WE WANT TO BE VIS VIS THINGS LIKE
IT MEANS THAT BECAUSE OF MASSIVE INTERCONNECTIVITY AND THE AVAILABILITY OF ARTIFICIAL
NOW I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO DO MY UNDERGRAD AND POSTGRAD EDUCATION IN THE UK AND THE US IN
SO I KIND OF HAD TO CHANGE HATS AND BECAME QUITE ENTREPRENEURIAL AND STARTED LOOKING FOR MONEY TO BUY THE
AND IMMEDIATELY WE HAD WONDERFUL RESULTS
I WAS I SUPPOSE THE FIRST USER
WHAT WOULD BE ON YOUR LIST FOR THAT MAGNA CARTA
IT IS BECAUSE OF WHAT IT STANDS FOR
YOU KNOW FROM AN OCEANIC PERSPECTIVE 450 IS WAY TOO HIGH
BUT THE FACT IS WE DO KNOW A LOT ABOUT ALL OF THOSE THINGS
IT MEANT A CONNECTION TO THE WORLD
BECAUSE VERY LIKELY IT'S MORE ABOUT YOU THAN ABOUT SOMEONE ELSE
EVERYONE BRINGS A UNIQUE PERSONALITY AND THEY'RE DYING FOR YOU TO NOTICE IT
IF YOU'RE IRRITATED BY SOMETHING SOMEONE ELSE IS DOING PAUSE AND REFLECT ON WHY
WHY IS THIS HAPPENING
WHAT'S GOING ON
IMPUNITY WAS BROKEN
BUT WELL AS I SAID I MEAN CAR DRIVERS ADAPT RIGHT
SO WHY CAN THAT BE
I MEAN THINK ABOUT HOW DIFFERENT CITIES ARE ACTUALLY
EACH DAY PEOPLE MAKE NEW DECISIONS AND PEOPLE CHANGE AND THE WORLD CHANGES AROUND THEM AND EACH DAY ALL OF
AND WHY IS THAT
IT'S BECAUSE THAT TRAVEL PATTERNS ARE MUCH LESS STABLE THAN YOU MIGHT THINK
YOU REALLY REDUCE CONGESTION QUITE SUBSTANTIALLY
I MEAN IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED SYSTEM
SOMEONE MUST CONTROL ALL OF THIS
NO ONE IS IN CHARGE
SO WE KNOW THAT PHEROMONES EXIST RIGHT THE WAY ACROSS THE ANIMAL KINGDOM
NOW SMELL WAS THE HARDEST OF THE SENSES TO CRACK AND THE NOBEL PRIZE AWARDED TO RICHARD AXEL
SO DO GO FORWARD AND DO SEARCH FOR MORE
AS ANY DOG OWNER CAN TELL YOU WE SMELL THEY SMELL
NO MATTER HOW EMBARRASSING WE NEED TO SEARCH AND GO FOR THE FIRST TIME WHERE NO ONE ELSE HAS
THERE COULD BE ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT HUMANS ARE DOING WITH PHEROMONES THAT WE SIMPLY DON'T KNOW AT THE MOMENT
IT WORKS JUST AS WELL UNDERWATER FOR GOLDFISH AND LOBSTERS
WELL THE FIRST THING OF COURSE IS THAT WE'RE MAMMALS AND MAMMALS ARE SMELLY
THEY HAVE NO SMELL AT ALL AND IT'S ONLY THE WONDERFUL BACTERIA GROWING ON THE RAINFOREST OF HAIR
NOW THIS IS A VERY ATTRACTIVE IDEA AND THE MOLECULES THEY MENTION SOUND REALLY
ALONG WITH THE PUBIC HAIR AND THE HAIR IN THE ARMPITS NEW GLANDS START TO SECRETE IN THOSE
WE'RE MAMMALS LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE WHO'S A MAMMAL AND WE PROBABLY DO HAVE THEM
IT'S A VERY INTERESTING SECRETION
ANY MOTHER WILL DO
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
AND ON THESE NERVES EXPOSED IN THE NOSE TO THE OUTSIDE AIR ARE RECEPTORS AND ODOR
BUT THE REAL REASON WE MIGHT THINK THAT HUMANS HAVE PHEROMONES IS THE CHANGE THAT OCCURS AS WE
AND OF COURSE IT'S PUBERTY
IT'S NOT ABOUT INDIVIDUAL RECOGNITION
WHAT WE NEED TO REMEMBER IS PHEROMONES ARE NOT JUST ABOUT SEX
AND ALMOST EVERY MAMMAL YOU CAN THINK OF HAS HAD A PHEROMONE IDENTIFIED AND OF COURSE AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF
WE PRODUCE A LOT OF SMELL
AND IT WAS ONLY IN 1959 THAT A GERMAN TEAM AFTER SPENDING 20 YEARS IN
HE BASICALLY WENT THROUGH SYSTEMATICALLY SHOWING THAT ONLY THE MOLECULE IN QUESTION WAS THE ONE THAT
THERE'S LOTS TO FIND
WHAT BENOIST SCHAAL AND HIS TEAM DEVELOPED WAS A SIMPLE TEST TO INVESTIGATE WHAT THE EFFECT OF
WE TURN TO THE PERSON ON THE RIGHT AND WE TELL THAT PERSON WHAT WE SEE ON OUR LEFT AND VICE
WE HAVE A HIJACKING OF YOUTUBE
THE PERSON SAID NO THAT'S FINE
SOMETHING IS UP IN PAKISTAN
IT TURNS OUT THERE IS NO ONE OVERALL MAP OF THE INTERNET
THE BAD NEWS IS THERE IS NO FIRE BRIGADE
IT'S NOT JUST THE CLUELESSNESS OF YOUTUBE ENGINEERS
AND HERE IS THE MESSAGE WHERE ONE OF THEM SAYS LOOKS LIKE WE'VE GOT A LIVE ONE
JIMBO'S IDEA WAS FOR NUPEDIA
TOTALLY MORTIFYING TO HIM
IT'S NOT A NOUN
THIS IS NOT A DRILL
AND IT TURNS OUT THIS MODEL IS EVERYWHERE ONCE YOU START LOOKING FOR IT
AND SOME OF THEM ARE MID LEVEL EMPLOYEES AT INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS AROUND THE WORLD
SO WHAT DO WE DO TO FIGURE OUT WHO IS WHERE
THEY HAD NONE OF THAT
AND YET MYSTERIOUSLY SOMEHOW THE BEE FLIES
NO ONE PAYS YOU TO DO THIS
I AM ONLY THE MESSENGER
AND MANY THANKS TO FOUNDATION BRIGITTE BARDOT THEY FUNDED THIS PROGRAM IN 2005 WHEN WE STARTED
SO THEY CAN RECOGNIZE THAT
SO IT DOES WORK
IT'S BEEN SIX YEARS NOW TWO YEARS AFTER WE STARTED WE HAVEN'T HAD A SINGLE CASE OF HUMAN RABIES REPORTED IN
WE'RE JUST AT THE BEGINNING
IT'S COMPLETELY DETRIMENTAL TO THE WHOLE PROJECT
IT'S THE SAME DEAL BRINGING THE DOGS BACK
SO THROUGH CATCHING THESE DOGS KINDLY AND BRINGING THEM BACK IN BETTER HEALTH THAN BEFORE ONLY THEN CAN WE GET
TO GET THE DOGS FOR THIS PROGRAM WE HAD TO TRAVEL A COUPLE OF HOURS AWAY TO A NEIGHBORING VILLAGE
WHAT MADE HER STAND OUT TO ME WAS THAT WHEN I WAS AT THE KENNELS I WAS WALKING AROUND LOOKING AT THE DOGS
FIVE YEARS DOWN THE TRACK SHE IS STILL HERE WITH US GOING STRONG
SO SHE IS MY DAILY REMINDER OF WHY I DO WHAT I DO AT VETS BEYOND BORDERS WHICH IS ABOUT PROVIDING BASIC
THAT MAKES PERFECT SENSE
WHAT IS THIS
THEY CHANGED THEMSELVES INTO HUMANS AND STOLE SOMETHING FROM PEOPLE
WHAT MADE A DIFFERENCE FOR THE ABECEDARIAN CHILDREN
WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR
I WAS BASICALLY A REGULAR AT MY LOCAL DOCTOR'S OFFICE
I WAS KNOWN TO PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE AS THE KID WHO COUGHED ALL THE TIME
ENTERING MY FIRST YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL MY LUNGS HAD ME ON THE ROPES
KEEPING ALL YOUR FEELINGS PENT UP LIKE THAT IS A RECIPE FOR DISASTER
IF THERE WAS A COMPETITION FOR BEING UNLUCKY WE'D UNFORTUNATELY LOSE IN THE LAST FEW SECONDS BECAUSE SOMETHING LUCKY HAPPENED TAKING US OUT OF
I WAS LIKE A CELEBRITY
FOR ALL I COULD CARE THE OLD ME DIED IN THAT HOSPITAL
ONE DAY I MADE THE VERY STUPID DECISION TO TRY AND GO OUT AND RUN AND HAVE A GOOD TIME
WITH MY NEWFOUND SPIRIT I DISCOVERED A PASSION FOR THEATER AND A LOVE FOR THE STAGE
NO OF COURSE NOT BECAUSE YOUR LIFE IS TERRIBLE
AND TO THOSE WHO LOCK THEMSELVES IN THEIR ROOM DENYING THAT THINGS WILL EVER CHANGE THE DAWN WILL NEVER COME AND THEY WERE MEANT TO LIVE IN
THAT LIFE CAN SOMETIMES SUCK
WITHIN MINUTES I WAS ON THE GROUND UNABLE TO BREATHE
TO SHOW YOU THIS I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU MY OWN STORY
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING YOU
BUT THAT WAS NOT THE CASE
WHAT WAS JUST A BRANCH TAPPING ON THE WINDOW NOW SEEMS LIKE A TERRIBLE MONSTER TRYING TO GET IN
ONE YOU CAN WALLOW IN YOUR OWN DESPAIR LIKE SOME ANGST FILLED SHAKESPEAREAN CHARACTER
EVERYONE THERE KNEW ME BY NAME
YOU'RE GOING TO BED AT 10 P
I WAS JUST TRYING TO LIVE MY LIFE
JUST A FEW MONTHS IN AND I WAS AS BAD AS I HAD EVER BEEN
OH NO YOU GOT PNEUMONIA
NEED HELP CRYING
MIDNIGHT CAN CREATE A SENSE OF UNFRIENDLINESS TO ALL AROUND YOU
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY I WASN'T GOING TO INTENTIONALLY PUT MYSELF DOWN BECAUSE I DIDN'T FEEL GOOD ENOUGH
IT IS SILENT
BUT THE QUESTION IS
YOU LOST YOUR JOB
I COULD TELL YOU THE VARIOUS TUBES THEY HAD SHOVED IN MY BODY OR THE TIME MY LUNG COLLAPSED
I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY A WORD DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT
BUT ANYWAYS THIS WAS BAD REALLY BAD LIKE FINDING OUT YOUR FAVORITE TV SHOW WAS CANCELED BAD
YOU FEEL OVERWHELMED AS LIFE BECOMES TOO DAUNTING A TASK TO TAKE ON AND THE WORLD DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THAT GREAT INVITING PLACE IT USED
SILLY ME RIGHT
THE ONCE COOL AND CALMING BREEZE NOW HOWLS AGAINST YOUR EARDRUMS
FOURTH DON'T YOU DARE THINK THAT THE ANSWER IS GOING TO BE FOUND IN SOME PILL OR AT THE BOTTOM OF A BOTTLE UNLESS
I REMEMBER ALL THE COUNTLESS ANGRY STARES I'D GET AS MY COUGHING WOULD INTERRUPT THEM WHILE THEY WERE TAKING A QUIZ
I HAD LIVED IN DARKNESS FOR SO LONG THAT MY MIND BEGAN TO WARP ITS OWN SURROUNDINGS
I COULD ALSO TELL YOU ABOUT ALL THE COUNTLESS PATIENTS ALL FIGHTING THEIR OWN UNIQUE BATTLES JUST AS I WAS FIGHTING MY OWN
WHAT CAN I GET YA
NOW IT'S THE FLU
I WAS BORN ANEW AND GIVEN A SECOND CHANCE AND THIS TIME I WAS GOING TO TAKE LIFE BY THE REINS AND ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING
I KNOW IT CAN BE HARD SOMETIMES BUT IF YOU REALLY DIG DEEP ENOUGH YOU CAN FIND A BRIGHT SIDE
HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET UNSAD
I WAS ONLY IN THIS WORLD FOR A FEW MINUTES AND I'D ALREADY MET MY GREATEST ENEMY
THAT'S HOW YOU THINK WHEN IN THAT STATE
COME FOR THE FUN STAY FOR THE FOOD AM I RIGHT
I SPENT MOST OF MY DAYS BEDRIDDEN
YOU'RE SO HANDSOME AND A CONSTANT SOURCE OF INSPIRATION BUT HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO FEEL HAPPY WHEN EVERYTHING AROUND ME FEELS SO
WHAT STARTED OFF AS WHAT SEEMED TO BE A BAD CASE OF ASTHMA SOON GREW INTO SOMETHING MUCH WORSE
I WAS SOON MISSING SCHOOL WEEKS AT A TIME
SURE I WAS DIFFERENT BUT THAT DIDN'T MATTER ANYMORE
I COULD TELL YOU THE MANY TIMES I THOUGHT ABOUT FINDING A WAY TO END IT RIGHT THEN AND THERE
I COULD TELL YOU ABOUT THE COURAGE AND OPTIMISM THEY SHOWED ONE I WISHED I COULD EMULATE
TAKE A COOKING CLASS OR SOMETHING
I KNOW ALL YOUR KIDS BACK HOME ARE PROBABLY THINKING FREE VACATION
HOBBIES BECOME CHORES AND FRIENDS BECOME STRANGERS
OR THE SECOND TIME
HOW ARE WE GOING TO FIX THIS
SO WHAT WAS SIXTUS'S DREAM WHAT WAS THE BIG PLAN HERE
RESOLUTION'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH THE IMAGE IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH
THE CORRELATIONS WERE INTERESTING BECAUSE THEY REALIZED THAT WHEN TEMPERATURE ROSE PEOPLE WERE GETTING MORE ATTACKS
THEY REALIZED THAT ALONG MAIN TRANSPORTATION CORRIDORS PEOPLE WERE GETTING MORE ATTACKS
I'M AN ENGINEER YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS IF YOU MADE A MIX TAPE OR PUT SOMETHING ON ITUNES I WOULD TOTALLY BUY
LET ME KNOW WHEN YOUR ALBUM DROPS
WHEN I WAS VERY YOUNG MY MOM BOUGHT A BANJO
SO WE CAME UP WITH THE IDEA TO START A POP UP PLACE
50 THREE COURSES OR FOR 27
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THEY'RE WELL DRESSED
BUT WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS NOW FOR MORE THAN A DECADE TO LEARN WHERE THEY GO
MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME I HEARD IT
WE USUALLY DON'T AND WE WANT TO START GETTING THE ACCOUNTING SYSTEM RIGHT SO WE CAN PAY THE REAL COST
SO PENGUINS ARE AMAZING ATHLETES
AND THIS IS TRUE OF MOST OF OUR LIVING SYSTEMS
AND SOME OF YOU CONSIDER THEM ALMOST PART OF YOUR FAMILY
THERE WERE PLENTY OF THEM
SO WHEN I WENT TO STUDY THE MAGELLANIC PENGUINS I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS
IF YOU HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH A PENGUIN YOU'D SEE IT IN THE SAME SORT OF WAY
WHY DO THEY DO THAT
THINGS DIE WHEN THERE'S NO FOOD
THEY'RE NOT BREEDING THEY'RE NOT EVEN AROUND
THEY'RE COMICAL THEY WALK UPRIGHT AND OF COURSE THEY'RE DILIGENT
SO A LOT HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST 40 YEARS AND WHAT I LEARNED WHEN I CAME TO THE GALAPAGOS IS THE IMPORTANCE OF
MAGELLANIC PENGUINS THE ONES THAT I WORK ON THEY CAN DIVE TO ABOUT 90 METERS AND THEY CAN STAY
YOU HAVE TO TRAIN TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT
SO I'VE BEEN STUCK
YOUR BLOOD TRIES TO BOIL
SPRING OFF THE THING AND FLY THROUGH THE AIR AND HOPEFULLY YOU MAKE IT LOOK GOOD
IF YOU'RE AT 100000 FEET YOU DIE
THE BODY SWELLS UP
WELL YOU'D DIE IF YOU DID THAT
THEY'RE GREAT FOR CATCHING YOU UP TO CERTAIN HEIGHTS
BUT IT WASN'T ALWAYS THAT WAY
AND VICE VERSA
THEY'RE ABOUT HOW YOU FEEL
THEY TALKED TO HIS TEACHERS
IF YOU DON'T SUPPORT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT SAME THING
HE IS THE AUTHOR OF THE LITTLE PRINCE
THEY WERE INTENTIONALLY FRAMING HIM BUT HISTORIANS DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED
SO THEY COMPARED DREYFUS'S HANDWRITING TO THAT ON THE MEMO AND INCLUDED THAT IT WAS A MATCH
THEY WENT AND SEARCHED DREYFUS'S APARTMENT LOOKING FOR ANY SIGNS OF ESPIONAGE
THEY WENT THROUGH HIS FILES AND THEY DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING
WE NEED SUNLIGHT AND GREEN GRASS AND FRESH AIR
WHY AREN'T WE ALL OVER THIS
GREEN BUILDINGS SHOULD BE THE MAINSTREAM BUT IF YOU GO OUTSIDE WALK AROUND DOWNTOWN OR THROUGH YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD YOU'LL SEE
THAT WAS THE DAY THAT I SHATTERED THE BALANCE MYTH
TO SET YOUR OWN AND TO SET THEM THE WAY THAT YOU WANT
SO HOW DO WE GET ALL OF THOSE THINGS DONE
SHE DECIDED THAT SHE WAS GOING TO GIVE ONLINE DATING A TRY
YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING
NOT ONLY ARE YOU POSITIVE THINKING BUT YOU'RE ALSO GIVING TIME TO SELF LOVE YOURSELF
WHAT IS YOUR VALUE
WHEN YOU ACT YOU START TO BEHAVE IT AND MIMIC THOSE THINGS THAT YOU FEED INTO AND WHAT
I'M GOING TO BE YOU SAVIOR TODAY
WHEN YOU START TO THINK POSITIVE OPPORTUNITIES OPEN AND DOORS OPEN
BECAUSE FOR ME IT TOOK A LOT FOR ME TO STAND HERE AND SAY I AM WORTH SOMETHING
I AM VALUED
BECAUSE SOCIETY HAS LABELED ME NOT ONLY UNHEALTHY BUT UNFIT
NOW I AM NOT A GRAPHIC ARTIST IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM SO I MADE THE PAGE AS PRETTY AS I POSSIBLY COULD
GIVE THEM A ROUND OF APPLAUSE AS THEY GO BACK TO THEIR SEATS
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
IT'S OK TO REMEMBER TO FORGET OR FORGET TO REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED
I NEED TWO PEOPLE TO HELP ME OUT REAL QUICK
SHE COULD ALSO READ THE SERIAL NUMBERS ON BILLS WHEN THEY WERE PLACED FACE DOWN ON A HARD SURFACE
NOW SHE'S THE FASTEST TYPIST SHE KNOWS
YOU HAVE TO TAKE RISKS ALSO
I BOUGHT THE CURRICULUM AND I LEARNED IT
BUT NONE OF US WERE EXPERTS IN GLOBAL HEALTH AND WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT SORT OF A MEDICATION WE COULD FUND RAISE FOR
IF CHILDREN ARE TAUGHT TO CULTIVATE THE CREATIVITY THEY ARE BORN WITH IT WILL RESULT IN A GENERATION OF INNOVATORS
DON'T LIKE SHARE RETWEET CALL ME NAMES WITHOUT AT LEAST THINKING
IN SHORT DOING EVERYTHING THAT A CARTOONIST SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO IN A FREE SOCIETY
SO WE WENT OUT TO TEST THESE HYPOTHESES ABOUT HOW TO ACTUALLY WORK AT THE ASTEROID
THAT MASS OF THAT VEHICLE WOULD HOLD US IN PLACE
JET PACKS RIGHT
CONSIDER RUNNING AN AUTHENTIC DRILL TO SEE IF YOUR TEN YEAR OLD IS REALLY READY TO HELP YOU IF YOU ARE
YOU KNOW NASA IS PLANNING TO GO TO THE SURFACE OF A BODY SOMEWHERE IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM
SO THEN WE TRIED THE JET PACKS
THAT'S LEFT FOR ANOTHER ANALOG
IF WE WERE WORKING WITH ANOTHER CREW MEMBER THEY COULD LOOK OUT FOR BOTH OF US AT THE SAME TIME
YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER AN ANALOG
HAVE YOU PUT IT INTO PLACE OR IS IT JUST WRITTEN UP IN A DOCUMENT
OR IF YOUR CO WORKERS KNOW HOW TO USE THE AD OR OTHER EQUIPMENT YOU HAVE
SO NOW THE QUESTION BECOMES
HOW COOL IS THAT
SO HOWEVER COOL THEY WERE WE REALIZED THAT MAYBE JET PACKS ARE ONLY GOOD FOR A SAFETY MEASURE
AND ANALOGS ARE ONE OF THE WAYS WE DO THIS
BUT THEY'LL HAVE INDIVIDUAL LEARNING THAT THEY'LL TAKE AWAY ON AREAS WHERE THEY NEED TO IMPROVE TO
SO WHY DO WE USE ANALOGS
SO I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU ABOUT AN ANALOG THAT I PARTICIPATED IN WITH NASA
AND EVERYBODY OUTSIDE THOUGHT WE WERE DYING
IN A MANGROVE FOREST LIKE THIS I HAVE NO IDEA
AND I HAD TO CALL UP MY MOTHER EVERY OTHER DAY SAYING NO MUM IT'S FINE FINE
AND I LET ALL OF THE LEAVES FALL FROM THE TREES THAT I HAVE ON MY PROPERTY
I LITERALLY WAS EATING THE SAME CARBON OVER AND OVER AGAIN
I MEAN THE MEDIA WAS MAKING IT SOUND LIKE WERE WERE DYING
IT'S SUCH A HUGE SUBJECT
AND I'M ALSO PROUD TO ANNOUNCE THAT YOU'RE GETTING A SNEAK PREVIEW ON FRIDAY WE'RE GOING TO ANNOUNCE THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY
WE STINK OF HAIRSPRAY AND UNDERARM DEODORANT AND ALL KINDS OF STUFF
AND I WOULD SAY THAT THE SMALL STUFF COUNTS
I'VE BEEN BUILDING TOPSOIL
PEOPLE MUST HAVE THOUGHT I WAS NUTS
AND UNDERSTAND ITS INTERACTIONS WITH THE ENTIRE EARTH
NOT ME THAT WAS FOR SURE
AND I HAVE HAWKS
AND IT'S VERY IRRITATING
AND WE KNEW HOW TO FIX IT
PEOPLE ON THE OTHER HAND WAS A DIFFERENT SUBJECT
WE ALL WENT QUITE NUTS I WILL SAY
AND SO NOW ALL THE BIRDS COME IN
PEOPLE JUST DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT I DID
AND WOMEN HERE'S WHAT I WANT YOU TO KNOW
I CAN CRUSH YOU WITH A HUG
YOU KNOW HE LOOKS AT ME
I THINK IT'S TIME WE TURN OVER THE TABLES
THAT DIDN'T GO OVER SO WELL
IS THIS ALL THERE IS FOR MY LIFE
SO THAT'S WHAT I DID
I JOINED THIS VENTURE CAPITAL INCUBATOR AS A FOUNDING PARTNER
SO I FELL IN LOVE WITH THE NIGHT SKY
THINK ABOUT IT
NO ONE PERSON CAN DESIGN VERY COMPLEX OBJECTS ALL BY
I DECIDED EARLY ON THAT MY INTELLECT WAS MY TICKET OUT AND I WORKED HARD IN AND OUT OF
I WON A SCHOLARSHIP TO WORK AT AN OBSERVATORY AND STUDY WITH A PROFESSIONAL ASTRONOMER
THE RESEARCH I DID WITH HER SUPPORT WON ME A TOP SPOT IN THE WESTINGHOUSE SCIENCE TALENT SEARCH
REMEMBER THAT WHEN HE'S JUST SAID WHEN YOU GOT SO MANY DAYS LEFT
WHAT WOULD I LEARN FROM SOMEBODY WHO'S BRILLIANT IN ONE WAY
SO I THOUGHT I WOULD SHARE WITH YOU
I AM HERE FOR A REASON AND I SUSPECT THAT A LOT OF YOU MIGHT BE HERE FOR THE SAME REASON
IT'S ABOUT WHO YOU LIVE WITH
THAT WAS JOHN KERRY'S HOME STATE
OR ARE THERE MORE SYSTEMATIC FACTORS AT WORK
RACISM IS PREDICTABLE
AND THEY ASK A SERIES OF REALLY INTERESTING QUESTIONS
HE LOST BADLY BUT EVERY DEMOCRAT DOES
BUT YEAH WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH ARKANSAS
ARE WE KIND OF STIGMATIZING PEOPLE FROM ARKANSAS AND THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY
BUT MAYBE THEY CAN GO AND SEE AND ENJOY A PROFESSIONAL BEAUTIFUL DANCE PERFORMANCE AND THEN OH BY
SO THAT WE CAN BRING THESE STORIES TO NEW AUDIENCES
WE CAN SHARE IN THE BEAUTY OF THE UNIVERSE AS SEEN BY A SCIENTIST
AUDIENCES WHO MAY NOT REALIZE THAT THEY ENJOY DANCE BECAUSE THEY HAVE NEVER
WE NEED TO BE CLEVER ABOUT IT TOO
SO THAT WE CAN BRING SCIENCE TO NEW AUDIENCES
TO TRANSLATE SCIENCE INTO A BRAND NEW LANGUAGE
AND WHAT HAPPENS AFTER
I HOPE YOU JOIN THE MOVEMENT
WE'VE SEEN THE NUMEROUS TED TALKS ON VULNERABILITY WE'VE BEEN TO A CONFERENCE LISTENED TO A PODCAST READ A BOOK
I'D FORGOTTEN ABOUT THAT
SOMEWHERE ALONG MY JOURNEY AS AN EDUCATOR I HAVE FORGOTTEN ABOUT THAT
AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME IT IS NON NEGOTIABLE
YOU GET UP TO THAT FIRST OBSTACLE PUT YOUR HANDS ON THE STEEL RAILS LIKE AMP QUOT ALL RIGHT
BUT WHAT IF WE COULD START LOOKING AT OBSTACLES IN A DIFFERENT WAY WHAT IF WE COULD START SEEING THEM THAN INSTEAD OF THINGS THAT ARE STOPPING US
I SAID I AM GOING TO LOOK AT THIS OBSTACLE AS AN OPPORTUNITY
WE'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO LET THEM EXPLORE THEIR ENVIRONMENT
SO THE MIND HAS SO MUCH POWER OVER WHAT WE DO IN LIFE
WHAT HAPPENS THEN
WE WENT UP TOGETHER WE STARTED CLIMBING
I WAS LIKE ALL RIGHT
YOU HAVE TO STOP
I LOVED IT TOO MUCH
BUT IF WE THINK WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT THEN WE MAKE IT
HE CAME DOWN AND HE SHOWED ME
HE CLIMBED THE WHOLE OBSTACLE CAME BACK DOWN
SO I WAS LIKE OH MUM JUST GOING TO THE LIBRARY TODAY
NOW LITTLE JOHNNY IS BEING LIKE OH MUM PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE
FOR US TO KNOW WHAT THE HUMAN BODY IS CAPABLE OF TO KNOW WHAT THE MIND IS CAPABLE OF
FOR ME IT WAS LIKE THE LOVE FOR IT I'LL WAIT ANYTHING ELSE IN LIFE
HE BUILT A HOUSE AROUND HIM MADE OF CARDBOARD AND WOOD FROM THE GARAGE
I CAN'T TELL IF THE SLICK WATER LINES ARE RIVERS LEADING FROM HIS TEMPLES OR JUST UNDER HIS EYES
AND HIS FATHER NEVER BLEW IT DOWN EVEN THOUGH IT SHIVERED WHEN PETER CRAWLED OUT OF IT AND SAID LOOK DAD
BECAUSE THE THING ABOUT PETER IS HE WAS NEVER AFRAID
AND THERE'S A COUPLE REASONS FOR THAT
AND THIS REALLY NEEDS TO TURN INTO SOMETHING MUCH BIGGER
SO I PLAYED A LOT WITH VISUAL FORM AND LANGUAGE
WHICH IS WHY I STARTED WRITING PETER AND THE CONCRETE JUNGLE
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT
QUEER VOICES NON QUEER VOICES AND I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE ACCESS TO ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT
LOOK WHAT I MADE
A LOT OF US USE READING TO ESCAPE OUR REALITY
AND I BECAME FRIENDS WITH CHARACTERS IN BOOKS
I BECAME FRIENDS WITH HERMIONE GRANGER AND JUNIE B
AND AS A WRITER I FOCUSED MOSTLY ON QUEER YOUTH NARRATIVE
AND YOU STAY STUCK
OKAY SO THAT'S YOUR VIEW OF REALITY
WHERE DOES IT COME FROM
WHAT MAKES YOU DIFFERENT THAN EVERY OTHER FORM OF ANIMAL ON THE PLANET IS THE FACT THAT YOU CAN CHOOSE A
DON'T TRY TO BE SOMETHING YOU'RE NOT
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT OH THERE WAS BREAKTHROUGH
SO NOW WHAT SHOULD I DO
IT GETS KIND OF COMPLICATED
IN ESSENCE ETHICS ASKS THE QUESTION
CONTRAST THAT WITH A DIFFERENT VIEW THAT SAYS
SO WHAT'S THE NEXT BRANCH
THIS ISN'T FOR THE YOU KNOW THE ACADEMIC INTELLECTUAL IN THE IVY TOWERS OF THE GREATEST UNIVERSITIES OF THE
AND IT BECOMES A RECURRING OR A REDUNDANT PATTERN IN LIFE
OKAY BUT WHERE DO YOUR VALUES COME FROM
I'D LIKE TO MAKE A DISTINCTION
THEY ASK A LOT OF WHY
WHAT'S IMPLIED IN THAT
WE NEED GRIT
GRIT IS A CONCEPT DEVELOPED BY DR
WE'VE NEVER LET THEM GO WE'VE PACKED THEM UP WE'VE SAVED THEM UP WE'VE TRANSPORTED THEM WE'VE WRITTEN THEN AROUND BUT WE'VE
IT LIMITS NOT ONLY OUR EMPATHY AND OUR CONNECTION BUT EVEN OUR ABILITY TO PERCEIVE
WHAT IS IT THAT REALLY EXCITES US IN THE MOMENT OF A GREAT SPEECH
AFTER A LONG DAY UNWIND AS YOU NORMALLY WOULD
WE MARGINALIZE THE ARTS IN SOCIETY
THAT S ALSO NOT A NEW IDEA
ONE OF AMERICA S FIRST GREAT COMPOSERS WAS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS
LET S FACE IT
SHORT SHORT SHORT LONG
I HAVE A DREAM
WATCH THE NEWS
WHEN WE PERCEIVE THE UNIVERSAL WE COME TO AN OBSERVATIONAL STATE
IT S THAT GATHERING OF MOMENTUM DRIVING TOWARDS THE GLORIOUS CULMINATING FINAL STATEMENT OF THE PREMISE
WHAT IS THAT
BUT THAT S JUST THE WAY THE WORLD IS
WE LIMIT THE OPPORTUNITY OF YOUNG PEOPLE TO STUDY MUSIC AT OUR PERIL
HE WAS PERHAPS POETICIZING PLATO WHO WROTE
ALL PERFORMING ARTS THEREFORE USE MUSIC TO MAKE US FEEL
BUT IT S MORE THAN THAT
MUSIC IS PROCESSED IN OLDER DEEPER CENTERS OF THE BRAIN THAN OUR COGNITIVE
YES WE STRUGGLE
WHEN I START TO EMBRACE MY IDENTITY I REALIZE WHAT A BEAUTIFUL THING IT
THERE ARE WOMEN OUT THERE HAVING TO COVER THEMSELVES UP BECAUSE OF TRADITIONS AND
WE NEED TO HAVE AMBITION THEN WE NEED TO SEE WHAT ARE THE
THAT'S WHEN I STARTED TO SEE MY ELEMENTS CLEARLY
THE JOURNALISM PLATFORMS THAT WE'VE USED FOR CENTURIES ARE DISPOSABLE
IT'S UPDATE AFTER ANOTHER UPDATE
AND THEN HE SAID SOMETHING THAT REALLY SHOCKED ME
AND I BELIEVE THAT THE MAIN THING THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN FOR THAT REIMAGINING TO BE SUCCESSFUL
THE POINT IS IT GOES INTO A PILE
AND WHEN THE LIGHT BROKE WE COULD SEE IT AS WELL
THE GOVERNMENT DIDN'T CHANGE
I SAID WHAT WAS IT
AND ALMOST OVERNIGHT IT BECAME ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GET A COLLEGE EDUCATION IF YOU WERE
THAT IS HOW MUCH IT TRANSFORMS WHO YOU ARE AS A PERSON
BUT WOULDN'T IT HAVE MADE MORE SENSE FOR THEM TO DO THAT WHILE THEY WERE LOCKED UP IN PRISON
THEY GOT THEIR COLLEGE EDUCATION AGAINST VERY TOUGH ODDS AND THEY MADE AMAZING LIVES FOR
HERE IS WHAT WE KNOW
THEY ALSO MADE AN INDELIBLE IMPRESSION ON ME ABOUT THE DRAMATIC
IT CHANGES THE WAY THAT YOU THINK ABOUT THE WORLD AND IT CHANGES THE WAY THAT YOU SOLVE
CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT
PEOPLE ASK ME SOMETIMES
IF WE WANT PEOPLE IN PRISON TO CHANGE THEY MUST GET
IT CHANGES THE WAY YOU THINK ABOUT YOURSELF
IN THIS COUNTRY THERE ARE SOME EXCELLENT COLLEGE EDUCATION PROGRAMS BUT
WE ALSO NEED THE THOUSANDS OF COLLEGES AND
WE KNOW THAT EDUCATION IS THE TRULY TRANSFORMATIVE THING THAT HELPS PEOPLE LEAVE
I WENT TO A WOMEN'S COLLEGE SMITH COLLEGE
AND I WAS VERY FORTUNATE TO SPEND FOUR YEARS INSIDE OF THAT
AND TO HELP THEM EXPAND THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORLD AND THE
SO LET'S TRY A COUPLE OF SENTENCES TOGETHER
AND SO IT'S NO LONGER PURE
IT'S JUST A SOCIAL CONSTRUCT
I HAD BEEN DOING THE SAME THING WITH GREEK
GET OVER IT
SO THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT THE FORMAL LANGUAGE
I WOULD SAY THINGS LIKE I LIKE SHEEPS MORE THAN GOATS
THEY STANDARDISED THE DIALECT OF THE HIGH SOCIETY IN LONDON AND THEY FORMED
AND THEN IT HIT ME
WHERE IS THIS DISCREPANCY COMING FROM
BECAUSE THEY FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE WITH LANGUAGE CHANGE
WHY ARE THEY STUCK THERE
WHEN WAS THAT GOLDEN AGE
LET ME EXPLAIN THAT BY GIVING AN EXAMPLE
BECAUSE THAT WAS THE TIME WHEN LANGUAGE WAS STANDARDISED
SO THAT'S THEIR BIGGEST MISTAKE
YOU PERCEIVE GRAMMARS AND DICTIONARIES TO BE HOLY BOOKS THE
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE CALLED PURISTS
I HAD BEEN JUDGING MODERN GREEK BASED ON GRAMMATICAL RULES FROM TWO AND A HALF MILLENNIA AGO
SO WHY ARE THINGS OUR BRAIN DOES NOT DETECT AS MISTAKES JUDGED
DO YOURSELVES A FAVOUR AND SEE THOSE BOOKS FOR WHAT THEY REALLY ARE
LANGUAGE PURISTS ARE STUCK THERE
AND TO WHOM DID YOU SPEAK
NO IT'S LIKE HOW YOUR BODY REACTS TO SOMETHING TO WHICH YOU ARE ALLERGIC
BUT LITERALLY MAKE NO MISTAKE AROUND THEM
I WAS NO LONGER THE EXPERT IN THE LANGUAGE SPOKEN AROUND ME
A LINGUISTIC MISTAKE' IS NOT A SIN
AND I WOULD MAKE ACTUAL MISTAKES THERE
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY CANNOT GET OVER
I HAD NO IDEA THAT THERE WAS A SEQUENCE OF CLASSES YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO TAKE IN ORDER TO GET YOUR DEGREE
AMONG THE THINGS THAT WE DO IS WE TAKE STUDENTS ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES SO THAT WE BRING COLLEGE TO LIFE FOR
SO I SPENT A SEMESTER ANALYZING HORROR FILMS FROM START TO END
WE TEACH THEM THE QUESTIONS TO ASK
I HAD TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING
PERHAPS THE MOST HUMOROUS EXAMPLE I CAN SHARE WITH YOU WAS THIS SPECIAL TOPICS COURSE I TOOK TITLED
AND THIS SHOULD COME TO MIND BECAUSE WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT 51 OF NEW MEXICO HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES UPON
WELL I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WE DO
HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN
WE VISIT LECTURE HALLS AND DORM ROOMS AND DINING SERVICES AND WE EXPOSE STUDENTS TO ALL THE SERVICES THAT
ADDITIONALLY WE MANDATE THAT STUDENTS TAKE DUAL ENROLLMENT COURSES SO THAT THEY EARN HIGH SCHOOL CREDIT WHILE
WE ALSO PAID FOR THIS EXPERIENCE
AMONG THE CHALLENGES THAT PROBABLY INSTANTLY COME TO MIND WOULD BE ACADEMIC CHALLENGES
SO WHAT DO WE DO
IN 2014 A STUDY PRESENTED TO THE NEW MEXICO LEGISLATIVE FINANCE COMMITTEE INDICATED THAT WHEN
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT I'M REFERRING TO IS PREPARING STUDENTS FOR THE CULTURE OF COLLEGE THOSE SPOKEN AND UNSPOKEN RULES
AND I KNOW A LITTLE SOMETHING ABOUT THIS
MY PARENTS WERE BOTH HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUTS AND TEEN PARENTS
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THEIR SUCCESS SHOULD BE HINGED ON LUCK
SO I GOT ALL OF THESE STORIES FROM HIM
WE'RE COMING DOWN TAKING A CHANCE ON DOING SOMETHING IN TWO WEEKS
AND I THINK I'VE WORKED OUT WHY
THAT REALLY STUCK WITH ME
AT THE BOTTOM IS COLOMBIA AND MEXICO WITH 2
9 BOOKS READ PER PERSON A YEAR
THEY WERE NUTS
BUT I PUSHED MYSELF
A BOOK IS A GIFT YOU CAN OPEN AGAIN AND AGAIN
AND NO SOONER THAN SHE APPEARED SHE VANISHED
BECAUSE AS AN INTIMACY EXPERT I FEEL THAT INTIMACY IS THE FOUNDATION FOR
WE HAVE ACCESS TO 4G TABLETS SMARTPHONES LAPTOPS
AND YES IT'S ALL SCRIPTED BY THE WAY EVEN THIS RELAXED OFF THE CUFF' BIT HAS BEEN PEER
WHICH AGAIN TECHNICAL TERM FOR SOMETHING THAT'S NOT THAT TECHNICAL
WE'RE PROJECTING A VERSION OF OURSELVES ONTO THE INTERNET
SO THERE IS NO TRADITIONAL BULLYING ROTA WHERE YOU GO HOME AT NIGHT AND
OVER 500 POLICE OFFICERS WERE KILLED
AND HELP US FEEL HAPPIER
DURING THAT TIME IN THE 70S AND 80S IT WAS CLAIMED TO HAVE ONE OF THE HIGHEST PER CAPITA MURDER RATES IN THE WORLD
PARKS ARE ONE OF THE TRUE DEMOCRATIC SPACES IN OUR CITIES
EVERYONE HAS THE RIGHT TO GO TO A PARK
WHAT IF ONLY SMOKESTACKS AND CRANES FILL YOUR SKY
IT'S CALLED THE 5 80 PARADOX
IT'S A LOT OF MONEY
SMOKING IS LINKED TO MORE THAN 15 CANCERS AND SINGLE HANDEDLY CONTRIBUTES TO THE FORMATION
TARGET THEM EDUCATE THEM GIVE THEM THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO AVOID THE CANCERS TO GET VACCINATIONS
WHY DOES IT COST SO MUCH
THIS IS THE UNDER FIVE MORTALITY RATE
TARGET THE GROUPS THAT NEED IT MOST
ADD THEM ALL TOGETHER AND THIS IS ABOUT WHAT YOU GET
HER BREAST IS ALSO REPLACED BY CANCER SHRUNKEN AND SMALL
ONLY 5 OF THE RESOURCES THAT ARE GOING INTO ONCOLOGY ARE BEING SPENT IN THE PARTS OF THE
WHAT ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE REST OF THE WORLD
6 BILLION TO MAKE
AND THAT'S TRUE
OVERALL IT'S A RESOUNDINGLY GOOD SUCCESS STORY
CANCER IS A DISEASE OF THE AGING
SO THESE ARE ESTIMATES OF THE IMPACT THESE PROGRAMS WILL HAVE BUT IF SUCCESSFUL AND IF THE HPV
BUT THIS IS HOW BREAST CANCER PRESENTS IN THE REST OF THE WORLD
WE'VE CHATTED ALREADY TODAY ABOUT HOW VERY DIFFICULT IT IS TO CHANGE BEHAVIORS
WE'VE GOT TO CHANGE APPROACHES AND CULTURES AROUND ALCOHOL YES BANNING SPORTS ADVERTISING FOR ALCOHOL
SO THE MAGIC BULLET KILLS THE CANCER AND LEAVES YOU UNAFFECTED WITHOUT ANY SIDE EFFECTS BUT OF
WHERE IS ALL THIS MONEY GOING
WELL THE PHARMA COMPANIES WILL SAY MY SEXY DRUG WAS REALLY EXPENSIVE TO MAKE
HELICOBACTER PYLORI IT'S A LITTLE BUG ENDEMIC IN SOME AREAS THAT CAUSES STOMACH CANCER
SHE'S HAVING A MAMMOGRAM AND WE'RE DETECTING AN ASYMPTOMATIC CANCER AT A STAGE WE'RE ABLE TO CURE
THE SEX WORKERS HEALTH WORKERS WHO ARE EXPOSED TO BLOOD PRODUCTS INTRAVENOUS DRUG ABUSERS
WHAT WE SPEND ON LOOKING AFTER PATIENTS WITH CANCER IN THE WORLD 170
SIMPLY BY HAPPY HAPPENSTANCE YOU'RE LIVING IN IRELAND
ABOUT HOW MUCH DID WE SPEND ON THE RIO OLYMPICS THIS YEAR
IT'LL BE VERY HARD TO STOP THEM FROM SMOKING IF THEY START IT AT 18 19 20
AROUND ABOUT 93 BILLION
THERE ARE GREAT VACCINATIONS AVAILABLE FOR BOTH HEPATITIS B AND ALSO HUMAN PAPILLOMA VIRUS
VERY OFTEN WE'RE DETECTING SOMETHING THAT A PATIENT CAN'T FEEL
BUT WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS AND SOME GOOD
AND IF WE CAN CHANGE ENOUGH COMMUNITIES WE CAN CHANGE NATIONAL ATTITUDES
THESE MOTHERS WE CALL THEM MENTOR MOTHERS ARE ABLE TO ENGAGE WOMEN WHO JUST LIKE THEMSELVES
THE LAST SISTER STOOD UP AND SAID I'M ALSO POSITIVE
AND THE NURSE TAKES YOU INTO A ROOM AND SHE TELLS YOU ABOUT THE TESTS AND HIV AND THE MEDICINES YOU CAN TAKE AND HOW TO TAKE CARE OF
AND I WANT TO CHANGE THE STORY A LITTLE BIT
I'M HIV POSITIVE
AND THIS IS SO IMPORTANT IN BREAKING THROUGH THE STIGMA
THE FATHER AND THE MOTHER TOGETHER THEY GET THE RESULTS
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO THROW ME OUT OF THE FAMILY
I STARTED THE PROGRAM IN CAPETOWN SOUTH AFRICA BACK IN 2001
WE CAN CHANGE NATIONAL ATTITUDES TO WOMEN AND NATIONAL ATTITUDES TO HIV
NOW DOCTORS AND NURSES THEY TOO GET TRAINED
BUT SO OFTEN THEY ONLY GET TRAINED ONCE SO THEY'RE NOT AWARE OF NEW MEDICINES NEW GUIDELINES AS THEY COME OUT
AND THEN YOU'RE OUT ON THE STREET AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GO
AND I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT ANNUAL PREGNANCIES AND HIV POSITIVE MOTHERS
AND YET THE REALITY IN RESOURCE POOR COUNTRIES IN THE ABSENCE OF TESTS AND TREATMENT 40 PERCENT
SO IT'S THE TEST A MOTHER GETS WHEN SHE COMES IN
WE HAVE TO START BY BRINGING SIMPLICITY AND DIGNITY TO WOMEN'S HEALTH ISSUES FROM REDUCING MATERNAL MORTALITY
IN FACT WE NEED HUGE SPOTLIGHTS PLACED IN THE WORLD OF WOMEN'S HEALTH IF WE NEED A BETTER TOMORROW
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF SIMPLE ISSUES THAT REQUIRE LOW COST INTERVENTIONS
BUT WE NEED MORE LIGHT
WE HAVE FACTS TO PROVE THAT IF WE INVEST IN WOMEN AND GIRLS AND PROVIDE THEM WITH BETTER HEALTH AND WELL BEING THEY WILL
THE WOMEN SAID THEY WOULD RATHER DELIVER ON A FLOOR THAN ON A PLASTIC SHEET THAT SMEARED BLOOD ALL OVER
THEY WERE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IT WOULD CAUSE MORE INFECTION
THE WOMEN WERE NEVER CONSULTED IN THIS PROCESS
UNPAID CARE ECONOMY
AND THAT'S THE CHALLENGE WE FACE GETTING EVERYBODY OUT OF POVERTY AND COMING BACK WITHIN WHAT
AND WHEN THEY HEAR OLD BRAINS TELLING JOKES ABOUT PAKIS QUEERS THEY JUST CRINGE
ANOTHER WOULD BE ADAPTABILITY
I'M RIGHT YOUR WRONG BLACK AND WHITE MISERABLIST
ANOTHER WOULD BE COLLABORATION
GEN Y NAVIGATE AROUND IT
AND THAT'S OLD BRAINS
I'LL GIVE 3 OR 4 EXAMPLES
THAT'S NOT COMFORTABLE
CROWDS ARE NOT A GOOD PLACE TO BE
THEY ARE THE YOUNG BRAINS
HE WAS DARWIN'S COUSIN
BUT WHAT'S BEGINNING TO HAPPEN IS BECAUSE THESE GEEKS ARE ALL GETTING TOGETHER BECAUSE THEY ARE HIGHLY QUALIFIED FOR
THESE ARE STARS BEING BORN OUT OF HERE
AND AS YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THIS WE'RE CONTINUING TO MUTATE
THAT WAS PARTLY BASED ON FRANCIS GALTON'S WORK
AND THIS WAS 60 YEARS AGO NEPAL
BECAUSE THEY HAVE UNDERSTOOD THEY HAVE TO GAIN THIS CREATIVE CONFIDENCE TO INNOVATE WELL
WE STARTED TO LOOK AT FEATURES HOW TO CONNECT THE CAMERA APPLICATION TO THE INTERNET
I STARTED TO EXPERIMENT
ALL THIS THINGS NEED TO BE SOLVED
AN INNOVATION AS YOU KNOW IS A HUGE BUSINESS DRIVER
TOGETHER AS A SUM THEY ARE BIGGER THAN JUST ONE DECISION
UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T REALIZE IT ALWAYS
MAKE IT REALLY EASY TO OPEN AND FAST
IT'S IN OUR POWER TO PROVIDE ACCESS FOR EVERYONE
AND IN FACT IN MY STUDIES OF 5000 PEOPLE EVERY YEAR I ASK THEM WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR
WHAT ABOUT THE LATE 1940S WHEN THE AUTOMOBILE BECAME VERY POPULAR AND WE SUDDENLY HAD
I THEN PUT THAT QUESTIONNAIRE ON VARIOUS DATING SITES IN 40
MEN'S JOBS BECAME MORE IMPORTANT THEY HAD TO MOVE THE ROCKS FELL THE TREES PLOW THE LAND
THAT WAS MY POINT WITH THAT
THEY'VE GOT BETTER THINGS TO DO IN THE WILD
WE NEED TO ENABLE PEOPLE TO FEEL IN CONTROL OF THEIR TIME
AND WE'VE SEEN THAT THE WORLD'S LABOR SUPPLY HAS QUADRUPLED
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR LISTENING
THEY WILL NOT VOTE FOR BREXIT OR FOR TRUMP OR FOR MARINE LE PEN
WHAT THAT MEANS IS WE'RE SEEING THE PAINFUL CONSTRUCTION OF A GLOBAL MARKET ECONOMY
THEIR PARENTS OR THEIR COMMUNITIES USED TO HAVE OCCUPATIONS AND PRIDE AND
I REALIZE THAT CONSUMERS ARE GETTING SMARTER AND THEY WERE LOOKING FOR GOOD PRODUCTS THAT WOULD MAKE THEM
AND BASICALLY HAVING TED FELLOWS ON YOUR RESUME MEANS YOU CAN OPEN THE DOOR PLACES WHERE YOU
YOU GET TO BE CONSIDERED FOR TED
TWO OF THE OTHER OUTCOMES WE'VE HAD
COM FELLOW SPEAKERS FROM MARCH 70 OF THEM ARE ON TED
SO I'M HERE TO CHANGE THAT
AND BECAUSE WE'VE SPENT SO MUCH TIME WORKING ON BOTH OF THOSE CHARACTERISTICS WE HAVE A COMMUNITY THAT
YOU GET TO SPEAK ON THE TED STAGE
AND OUT OF THAT FIELD CAMPAIGN WE'LL PROBABLY GET A FEW DOZEN PAPERS ON A FEW DOZEN PROCESSES OR MOLECULES
DOLORES BROWNE THE NEW YORK NEGRO BALLET IN THE 50S
FINDING OUT THAT AFRICAN AMERICANS HAVE A RICH HISTORY IN THE BALLET WORLD WAS AN INCREDIBLE DISCOVERY FOR ME
SHE DANCED AT THE METROPOLITAN OPERA
SO I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR US TO KNOW EVERY SIDE OF THE HISTORY OF CLASSICAL
IT WAS SOMETHING THAT I DID WITH A FORMER NFL PLAYER
THIS WAS REALLY COOL
WHILE STAYING TRUE AND KEEPING THOSE CLASSICS ALIVE WE CAN BUILD AND CREATE NEW CLASSICS AND A BRIGHT FUTURE FOR
ALLOWING NEW CHOREOGRAPHERS THE SPACE WITHOUT JUDGEMENT TO CREATE WE COULD VERY WELL HAVE ANOTHER
ARTHUR MITCHELL OF COURSE WAS THE PRINCIPAL DANCER WITH NEW YORK CITY BALLET THE FIRST BLACK MAN
SO I THINK THAT WE ARE GETTING BACK TO THAT POINT NOW WITH OUR GENERATION WITH A DIFFERENT
LACK OF DIVERSITY
STORY BALLETS ARE THE MOST CLASSIC WITHIN THE BALLET REPERTORY
THE FIRST ACT BY SALAFI JIHADI GROUPS WHEN THEY TAKE OVER AN AREA IS TO DESTROY
AND THEN THEY'VE GOT ME MAPPED
AH YOU'RE A KENYAN ASIAN
I'VE WORKED WITH ONE OF THOSE
I'M NOT AN ADDICT
IF WE ADDICTS HAD A NORMAL DISEASE WE WOULD BE TREATED WITH SYMPATHY AND COMFORT INSTEAD WE'RE
WENT COLD TURKEY AND TRIED TO DETOX
DAY 5 I WAS IN A FULL BLOWN BINGE I WAS DRINKING ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING I
KEITH HUMPHREYS FROM STANFORD UNIVERSITY SAID IT'S REMARKABLE THAT PEOPLE BELIEVE WHAT'S NEEDED IS MORE
HE SAID WELL WHY DON'T YOU WRITE A BOOK
WHAT IF IT'S A WORSE RELAPSE THAN THE LAST ONE
THE OPIATE BLOCKER STOPS THOSE ENDORPHINS FROM EVEN LEAVING THE ROOM
I ALSO ASKED HIM TO THANK AMERICAN RESEARCHER DR
I MEAN IF YOU LOOK AT IT FROM THE OUTSIDE I HAD A GREAT LIFE
THINK ABOUT IT
DEVELOPING AUD WAS AN INCREDIBLY CONFUSING THING FOR SOMEBODY WHO ADMITTEDLY LIKES TO BE IN
I WAS A VERY LIGHT DRINKER IN MY 20S
AND YOU GOT IT WRONG
I DON'T ALWAYS KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT
WE HAVE OUR THEORIES BUT WE ARE NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO PROVE OUR THEORIES SO OUR JOB IS TO TRY AND
AND THE ANSWER IS NO
AND IT TOOK 18 MONTHS
BUT WHAT IF YOU WANT TO SEE BRUSH STROKES
IT'S CALLED COLLECTIONS
THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A SIKH S I K H
REVOLUTIONARY LOVE REQUIRES US TO BREATHE AND PUSH THROUGH THE FIRE WITH A WARRIOR'S HEART AND
WHEN RIGHT WING NATIONALIST MOVEMENTS ARE ON THE RISE AROUND THE GLOBE AND HAVE CAPTURED THE PRESIDENCY OF THE
I WILL REFUSE TO HATE THEM EVEN WHEN THEY HATE ME
MY GRANDFATHER SAW ME AS A WARRIOR
IF WE DON'T BREATHE WE WILL DIE
BREATHE SHE SAYS
INDIGENOUS PEOPLE SAVAGE
WHEN EXECUTIVE ORDERS AND NEWS OF VIOLENCE HITS OUR BODIES HARD
I WILL EVEN VOW TO PROTECT THEM WHEN THEY ARE IN HARM'S WAY
AND IN OUR MOST PAINFUL MOMENTS IN THE FACE OF THE FIRES OF INJUSTICE I HAVE
THE CONTRACTIONS ARE LESS THAN A MINUTE APART
PAPA JI DRIED MY TEARS GAVE ME THE WORDS OF GURU NANAK THE FOUNDER OF THE SIKH
KAREN BENTRUP OUR VOLUNTEER GARDEN MANAGER AND I STOOD BEHIND THE SCIENCE BUILDING AND VIEWED THE WASTED
IS THAT A BIG NUMBER
THEY ALL HATED EACH OTHER AND ALL MOVED TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE PLANET
GUYS THIS WOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING
SO MY FATHER'S FATHER WAS ONE OF 10 RESNICK BROTHERS
BUT MAYBE IT'S A BAD THING AS WELL
BIGGER CLAN GATHERINGS AND SO ON
NOT HARD TO IMAGINE
MY COMPANY HAS SOFTWARE THAT DOES THIS RIGHT NOW
I'M IN SO MUCH PAIN
WELL EVERYBODY CAN THROW AROUND BIG NUMBERS
AND SO THEY WERE GIVEN L DOPA AND THEIR SYMPTOMS DID IMPROVE BUT THEY WEREN'T TOTALLY ASYMPTOMATIC
SO ON TOP OF L DOPA THEY GAVE THESE KIDS A SEROTONIN PRECURSOR DRUG AND THEY'RE EFFECTIVELY NORMAL NOW
AND I'M SITTING THERE AND I'M STRUGGLING TO GET A STRIKE
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
HOW HARD CAN IT BE TO DESIGN A BOWLING BALL
MAN THAT WAS REALLY COOL TO WATCH
I WAS IN COMPLETE AWE BECAUSE THAT WAS LIKE THE BEST HE'S EVER BOWLED IN HIS ENTIRE LIFE
I PLAYED A SMALL ROLE IN HIS SUCCESS
THEN I SAID
ULTIMATELY I WAS ABLE TO BOWL FOR THE PURDUE BOWLING TEAM AS CAPTAIN AND WHEN IT CAME TIME TO GRADUATE
HOWEVER AS FEMINISM WAVES ITS IDEAL PICTURE OF THE NON WESTERN WORLD
AS THE BUS CAME AND MY FRIENDS AND I WERE GETTING READY TO BOARD ON THE BUS I TURNED TO THE WOMEN A BIG SMILE ON MY FACE
I COULDN'T HELP BUT COMPARE HOW MY STORY WAS REPRESENTED ON TV IN
SO THE CONVERSATION CHANGES
RESCUING BROWN WOMEN HAS HAD A LONG HISTORY IN WESTERN IMPERIALIST PROJECTS
HER JAW HIT THE GROUND AND THAT WAS ABOUT IT FROM HER
WHERE'D YOU GO
THEY HAD BEEN USING NONVIOLENCE FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS BUT HAD GROWN DISENCHANTED SINCE NOBODY
BRITTANY DID THAT
AT XPRIZE WE DESIGN AND LAUNCH LARGE SCALE AUDACIOUS COMPETITIONS
AND YET IT HAPPENED DIDN'T IT
HE HAD ONLY HAD HIS PILOT'S LICENSE FOR TWO YEARS BEFORE HE MADE THAT MOMENTOUS FLIGHT
YOU GUYS DON'T THINK ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE RIGHT
YOU THINK THIS IS JUST BIG GRANDIOSE TALK
I BELIEVE THAT YOU AND I ARE CAPABLE OF WORLD CHANGE RADICAL WORLD CHANGE
EMPLOYERS TELL US WHEN WE DO THE RESEARCH THAT YES THEY WANT PEOPLE WHO CAN READ AND WRITE AND
SO THAT'S YOUR MUSICAL MATERIAL
WHY DID I DECIDE TO COME AND TALK ABOUT THIS
IN MY COUNTRY IN GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS SOMETIMES AS LOW AS 20 IN SOME STATES ACTUALLY HAVE A SPECIALIST MUSIC TEACHER
BUT OF COURSE I'M ACTUALLY MAKING A POINT
AND SO OUR BRAIN LOVES PATTERNS AND PATTERNS IN SOUND ARE INCREDIBLY COMPLEX AND SOPHISTICATED
LET ME DO IT AGAIN IF YOU LIKE THAT
SOME AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION
THEY ARE MADE FOR EVERYBODY SO IT'S NOT ALLOWED THAT ANY INSTITUTION DOESN'T RESPECT THE RULES
THEN I SOUGHT THE DICTIONARY
BUT AT THAT MOMENT I ACKNOWLEDGED DIFFERENT EMOTIONS
SO I NEEDED TO START CONSULTING IN MYSELF AND TRUSTING MYSELF MORE
I JUST KEPT TALKING
MY MOTHER IS SCHIZOPHRENIC
SO IN THAT MOMENT I STOOD THERE AND ALTHOUGH I WAS AFRAID I REALIZED THAT
OFTENTIMES WE CHOOSE ONE EMOTION
JUST NAME YOUR PARENTAL ANXIETIES
I MEAN YOU TALK ABOUT LOW PRIORITY RIGHT
OR FANCY APPLIANCES
AND LET ME BE BLUNT ABOUT THIS
ONE OF THE SMARTEST PEOPLE I'VE EVER MET
MG I THINK TO AN EXTENT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S AXIOMATIC AMONG HACKERS THAT THEY DO
AND HE EXPLAINED TO ME HOW IN 2003 AND 2004 HE WOULD GO ON SPREES IN NEW
AT HIS OPEN PRISON HE CAME UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF FINANCIAL FRAUDSTERS AND THOSE FINANCIAL
IT WAS QUITE DIFFICULT
BUT NOW OVER 50 PERCENT ARE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES
I'D SEE PIZZA AND NEEDED TO HAVE IT
TO COMPARE FROM 1958 TO 2014 THERE HAVE BEEN 548 FATAL SHARK ATTACKS AS SAID
BUT I HOPE I'VE GIVEN YOU SOME FOOD FOR THOUGHT
AND UNDERSTAND THE IMPACTS OF WHAT YOU EAT
IT TOOK TIME TO UNDERSTAND WHAT I NEEDED TO CONSUME DAILY
CHICKEN FISH TURKEY PORK AND BEEF
WHEN I ATE EVERYTHING AND ANYTHING LESS THAN 20 TO 30 PERCENT OF MY DIET WAS FRUITS AND VEGETABLES
BUT MY DAILY CALORIES ARE MOSTLY VEGETABLES FRUITS CARBS AND PROTEINS WHILE CONSUMING VERY LITTLE FATS
WHAT EXACTLY AM I EATING AND PUTTING INTO MY BODY
LITTLE CHICKS ARE THROWN INTO GRINDERS ALIVE
BUT WHEN SOMEONE EATS THERE ARE SO MANY FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO WHAT GOES INTO THEIR BODIES
BUT HAVE YOU EVER STOPPED TO THINK WHERE IS THIS FOOD COMING FROM
AFTER REALIZING THAT THERE'S A LOT MORE TO VEGAN THAN JUST EATING VEGETABLES I DID RESEARCH AND THAT DEFINITELY GAVE ME THE
BUT PLENTY OF PEOPLE CAN ARGUE THAT VEGANISM ISN'T HEALTHY BECAUSE WELL OREOS ARE VEGAN FROSTED
IF YOU HAVE A DOG OR A CAT PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND
LEARN WHERE YOUR FOOD IS COMING FROM
IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE AS BEING HUNGRY TO BEING FULL
BUT TURNS OUT MY BLOOD LEVELS WERE THE BEST THEY'VE EVER BEEN IN A LONG TIME
JUST GOING TO SHOW THAT GOING VEGAN WAS A CHOICE THAT I WILL FOREVER STAND BY
WHAT IS IT FOR
WE WANT TO MINIMIZE THE DISTANCE
NOVELTY IS WHAT PARTS OF YOU DO YOU BRING OUT
MY PARTNER HASN'T TAKEN CARE OF ME IN SO LONG
AND THEN I BEGAN TO ASK THE REVERSE QUESTION
WE WANT TO NEUTRALIZE THE TENSIONS
AND THEY MAY BE GONE BUT THEY'RE NEVER REALLY AWAY
AND THOSE ARE OFTEN THE PEOPLE THAT WILL TELL YOU IN THE BEGINNING IT WAS SUPER HOT
WHAT DO YOU SEEK TO EXPRESS THERE
IT CONTINUES INTO OUR SEX LIVES UP TO THE END
ON THE ONE HAND YOU WANT THE SECURITY IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO GO
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR ME TO BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND WHO ARE THE COUPLES WHO HAVE AN EROTIC SPARK
WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LOVE AND DESIRE
BUT THE CENTRAL AGENT IS REALLY THAT PIECE CALLED THE IMAGINATION
WE WANT TO CONTRACT THAT GAP
IT'S A SPACE YOU ENTER INSIDE YOURSELF AND WITH ANOTHER OR OTHERS
AND ACROSS CULTURE ACROSS RELIGION AND ACROSS GENDER EXCEPT FOR ONE THERE ARE A FEW ANSWERS
THAT WILL BECOME BURDENED WITH EXTRA WORRY AND EXTRA RESPONSIBILITY AND
BUT THEN I TOOK A QUESTION WITH ME
ARE YOU GOING TO BE ANGRY WITH ME
SO WHERE DO YOU GO IN SEX
IS IT A PLACE FOR NAUGHTINESS AND IS IT A PLACE TO BE SAFELY AGGRESSIVE
DON'T WE HAVE EVERYTHING YOU NEED TOGETHER YOU AND I
RESPONSIBILITY AND DESIRE JUST BUTT HEADS
SO WHEN I BEGAN TO THINK ABOUT EROTICISM I BEGAN TO THINK ABOUT THE POETICS OF SEX
THEY ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT FOREPLAY IS NOT SOMETHING YOU DO FIVE MINUTES BEFORE THE REAL THING
IT WON'T MAKE A DENT
THE MORE CONNECTED I BECAME THE MORE RESPONSIBLE I FELT THE LESS I WAS ABLE TO LET GO IN
AND IF YOU TELL THEM HEY KIDDO THE WORLD'S A GREAT PLACE
SEX IS A PLACE YOU GO
IT STARTS VERY YOUNG
OR IN OTHER WORDS I SOMETIMES SAY FIRE NEEDS AIR
AND WHEN IT'S SAID LIKE THAT IT'S OFTEN QUITE ABSTRACT
WHAT'S SO GOOD OUT THERE
WE CAN EXPERIENCE THAT POWERFUL THING CALLED ANTICIPATION WHICH IS A MORTAR TO DESIRE
AND PEOPLE BEGAN TO SAY I TURN MYSELF OFF WHEN I FEEL DEAD INSIDE WHEN I DON'T LIKE MY BODY
IT'S ABOUT YOU CREATE A SPACE WHERE YOU LEAVE MANAGEMENT INC
IN LOVE WE WANT TO HAVE WE WANT TO KNOW THE BELOVED
THESE ARE SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE AT THE CENTER OF MY EXPLORATION ON THE NATURE OF EROTIC
ALL THESE ANCHORING GROUNDING EXPERIENCES OF OUR LIVES THAT WE CALL HOME
MAYBE WHERE YOU LEAVE THE AGILE PROGRAM
BUT WHAT THEY KNOW IS THEY KNOW HOW TO RESURRECT IT
BUT IF ON THIS SIDE THERE IS SOMEBODY WHO SAYS I'M WORRIED
GIVE ME PREDICTABILITY GIVE ME SURPRISE
NOW IF YOU ARE DEAD INSIDE THE OTHER PERSON CAN DO A LOT OF THINGS FOR VALENTINE'S
THEY DON'T REALLY DO WELL TOGETHER
WE CAN HINT AT IT
AND THESE SYMPTOMS WERE THE FACT THAT THEY LOST THEIR MEMORIES THEY COULDN'T LEARN NEW THINGS AND THEY
IT'S CRITICAL FOR CREATIVITY AND FORMS OF INNOVATION AND I BET EVERYONE HERE HAS
INSTEAD I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING WHICH I THINK IS MUCH MORE INTERESTING
YOU MAY HAVE BEEN MUGGED YOU MAY HAVE BEEN IN A CAR CRASH MAYBE OTHER THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO YOU THAT YOU'D REALLY YOU
RIGHT NOW OUR RESULTS ARE VERY PROMISING SO WE'RE HOPING THAT IN NOT TOO MANY YEARS WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO OFFER A SORT
BUT SUBSEQUENT RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT HE WAS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT
IT'S BEEN SHOWN THAT IF WE TRIGGER SOME KINDS OF PROBLEMS WHILE PEOPLE ARE ASLEEP THEN THEY CAN BE BETTER
IT'S HELPING US TO STRENGTHEN UP MEMORIES
PRESS AS MANY 4 1 3 2 4 SEQUENCES AS YOU CAN
SO I'M SURE SOME OF YOU HAVE HAD A TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE AT SOME POINT IN YOUR LIFE
INSTEAD OF JUST MEASURING OUR SLEEP WE COULD BE USING THE INFORMATION THAT WE NOW HAVE ABOUT
LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU AN EXPERIMENT WHICH SHOWS THIS
THIS IS HOW WE CAN MANIPULATE THE SLEEP THAT WE DO GET IN ORDER TO GET THE MOST OUT OF IT IN ORDER TO
WE ALL KNOW WE LIVE IN A SLEEP DEPRIVED SOCIETY
CONTRARY TO POPULAR OPINION THE BRAIN DOESN'T JUST SWITCH OFF WHEN WE GO TO SLEEP INSTEAD IT GOES THROUGH A
NOW INTERESTINGLY AS WE AGE OUR SLEEP PATTERNS ALSO CHANGE
SO WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT IF THERE WAS A WAY THAT WE COULD MAINTAIN THOSE SLOW
I RECLAIMED MY BODY AFTER A LIFETIME OF SELF CRITICISM BROUGHT ON BY A
WHEN SHE GETS STRONGER HE GETS STRONGER
SO I KNEW SOMETHING WAS MISSING INSIDE OF ME
YOU THINK ANYONE ANYTIME ANYWHERE CAN TELL YOU WHAT YOU CAN AND CANNOT DO IN YOUR BODY
IT WAS A CELEBRATION OF THE FEMININE BODY
THEREFORE VISUAL PERCEPTION IS A MAJOR PART OF THE NATURAL WORLD
THAT SAID VISUAL PERCEPTION IS NOT VERY WELL UNDERSTOOD NOT ONLY IN ANIMALS BUT EVEN IN
TODAY I AM GOING TO TELL A STORY THAT BEGINS WITH THE OCTOPUS AND TALKS ABOUT SEVERAL ASPECTS
WELL WHEN I'M NOT FIGHTING THE CODED GAZE AS A POET OF CODE I'M A GRADUATE STUDENT AT THE
IT'S VERY HIGHLY REFLECTING
OF COURSE MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING WORKS THROUGH A MAGNETIC SIGNAL SO THAT'S A WAY OF
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE THE LIGHT BEND CONTINUOUSLY RATHER THAN SUDDENLY AND THAT MEANS NOT A SUDDEN
I HAVE JUST TIME TO TELL YOU ABOUT THREE OF THEM VERY BRIEFLY
TERAHERTZ RADIATION IS INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT
THERE'S NO CHANGE
BUT WHAT EINSTEIN WAS SAYING
AND IT WAS ARTHUR STANLEY EDDINGTON'S EXPERIMENT OF SEEING THE BENDING OF LIGHT AROUND THE SUN
BUT WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT WE WANT TO DO SOMETHING MORE SOPHISTICATED
THEY CHANGED SOMETHING
THE WORK IS VERY PRACTICAL AND I CONSIDER MYSELF A GROUNDED PERSON SO I WAS FEELING
WITHIN MONTHS HE REGAINED HIS SELF CONFIDENCE AND WITH WINNING DRESSAGE
HE SHOWED ME HE WOKE NICKY'S FATHER UP IN THE NIGHT BY WALKING OVER HIM
I COULD SHARE SO MANY OTHER STORIES WITH YOU
I THOUGHT THIS IS GOING TO HELP ME WITH MORGAN SO I WENT ALONG
I'M FORTUNATE TO BE HAVING MORE AND MORE OF THESE MOMENTS
I'M NOT EVEN THERE YET I MEAN SAHARA BECK IS HARDLY A HOUSEHOLD NAME
WHAT IF IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE LIKE THAT
I PUT THAT MASK ON SO VERY TIGHT AND YEAH I GOT INTO A LOT OF FIGHTS
I HAVE EXITS AND ENTRANCES
BUT IT DOESN'T MANIFEST IT IN QUITE THE SAME WAY
SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH YOUR LIFE
THAT'S HOW THEY MET
SO WE HAD TO FIND A WAY TO RULE OUT ALIENS
HE HAD ONE POSITIVE ATTRIBUTE
HE WENT OUT HE BECAME A COWBOY AND HE DOES HIS TORONTO ACCOUNTS ON THE INTERNET
AND HE WAS VERY NBSP VALUABLE
AND HE SAID I M NBSP SORRY
SHE NBSP REMEMBERED HER ROOMMATE HAD AN UNCLE IN ALBERTA WHO WAS A RANCHER
NOBODY TALKED TO RONNIE
AND SO I JUST GAVE UP
I SAID A CHIMPANZEE
EVERY TIME YOU MAKE SOMEONE ELSE S DREAM COME TRUE IT ECHOES
I WENT AROUND NBSP THE COUNTRY DIDN'T MAKE MONEY BUT I HAD A LOT OF FUN
SO HERE'S WHAT YOU DO
HE SAID YEAH IF YOU HAD STEAK THIS MONTH SOMEWHERE THERE'S A COWBOY
I SAID WHAT
A WOMAN RAISED HER HAND AND SAID PATRICK SWAYZE'S MOTHER HAS A RESORT 30 MILES AWAY I WORK THERE WEEKENDS
WE GOT INNOCENT VISITING COUSINS FROM OHIO AND WE HAD THE PARTY
WE HAD A GROUP WITH SIX PEOPLE THERE WERE FIVE WOMEN AND THIS GUY
I SAID A WOMAN
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING NBSP ABOUT
I REALLY AM BECAUSE IT S ALL ABOUT DREAMS AND THAT S WHAT IT S ALL ABOUT AND NO KIDDING THAT S
WE HAD TO WALK HIM HOME NBSP AFTER THE GROUP BUT WE WERE USED TO HIM WE LIKED HIM
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE WANT
NO MAGICAL NEW AGE WAY IT ECHOES IN PRACTICAL WONDERFUL WAYS
I DON T KNOW IF THERE ARE COWBOYS
I'VE GOT TO RENT A CHIMP
I COULDN T GET A DAY CARE CENTER SO I COULDN T TAKE A JOB
JUST OUT OF POLITENESS AND HE WOULD ALWAYS SAY I M FINE
SOMEBODY LOOKED AT THEM AND SAID WHAT A PAIR OF DINGBATS
WE VE GOT EVERYTHING
THEY JUST DON T GET TREATED
AND HE FOUND SOMEBODY
HER DAUGHTER'S GOING TO BECOME A TEACHER
BUT HELL IT WAS RONNIE AND SO WE WERE VERY HAPPY
I D GOTTEN A DIVORCE I NBSP HAD NO MONEY I WAS IN NEW YORK CITY I HAD TWO VERY SMALL CHILDREN
BUT HE NEVER WANTED ANYTHING
SHE SAID MY BROTHER HAS A BIG STAND OF THOSE IN AUSTRALIA
IN THIS GROUP THERE WAS SOMEBODY NAMED RONNIE
WELL THAT S WHAT I CALL HIM
YOU WANT TO RENT
THEN THEY WERE DONE THEY HUGGED EACH OTHER THEY WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM THEY WERE SO HAPPY
WE VE GOT TRAINERS TOO
IT WAS A TRIUMPH
FINALLY THEY SAID LISTEN YOU HAVE TO TELL US WHAT YOU WANT
I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU ABOUT WISH AND OBSTACLE THAT IS THE SECRET
HE SAID YEAH I HAVE A PLACE TO ENTERTAIN NOW
OKAY WHY DON T YOU GUYS GO OUT GET A VILLAGE VOICE AND FIND HIM AN APARTMENT WE LL HAVE A PAINTING PARTY I LL BRING A
WE CAN'T TAKE ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE
COME BACK HERE I LL GIVE YOU HIS NUMBER
SHE CAME IN DRAGGED HIM IN SOMEBODY HAD BEEN WORKING HER DOG NBSP HAD DIED AND SHE WAS CRYING
AND THEY BRIGHTENED UP
THEY SAID OKAY AND THEY NBSP DID
YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO
I CAN'T DO IT
SHE SAID YES
BUT THEIR REAL CALLING SHOULD BE MORE THAN THAT
I TOLD HIM THE DEN WAS ARTIFICIAL THAT WE MADE IT
I TOLD THEM THE WOLVES WERE RENTED
I'VE MADE MANY OTHER MISTAKES
THE FILM WAS DESIGNED TO COMBAT THE MISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS OF THE RAUNCHING AND HUNTING
I GAVE MANY TALKS ABOUT IT AND AT ONE OF THESE TALKS SOMEBODY IN THE AUDIENCE PUT THEIR HAND UP AND SAID HOW
I MEAN MY GOODNESS YOU LOOK UGLY THIS MORNING
THAT WOULD BE A WORLD THAT DOES SOUND BEAUTIFUL AND ONE WHERE UNDERSTANDING WOULD BE THE
I'M NOT GOING TO GET VERY TECHNICAL ABOUT THIS FOR ANY OF YOU WHO ARE VOICE COACHES
IT'S THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN START A WAR OR SAY I LOVE YOU
YOU HAVE AN AMAZING TOOLBOX
THIS IS A SERIOUS POINT HERE
AND THEN ROLL AN R
GO AND GET A VOICE COACH
PEOPLE WHO SPEAK ALL ON ONE NOTE ARE REALLY QUITE HARD TO LISTEN TO IF THEY DON'T HAVE ANY PROSODY AT
YOU KNOW SOMEBODY IS BOMBARDING YOU WITH THEIR OPINIONS AS IF THEY WERE TRUE
OF COURSE WHERE THIS ALL COMES INTO PLAY MOST OF ALL IS WHEN YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING REALLY IMPORTANT TO DO
IT MIGHT BE STANDING ON A STAGE LIKE THIS AND GIVING A TALK TO PEOPLE
WE COMPLAIN ABOUT THE WEATHER SPORT ABOUT POLITICS ABOUT EVERYTHING BUT ACTUALLY COMPLAINING IS VIRAL MISERY
THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT
I LOVED MY WORK
I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT HOW YOU COULD CHANGE THAT
OBVIOUSLY WHEN THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD WHEN THE MOST POWERFUL PERSON IN THE ENTIRE WORLD WHICH IS THE
AND THEY'VE CREATED A MASSIVE ECONOMY FOR THEMSELVES AND AN AMAZING AMOUNT OF INCOME
YESTERDAY I HAPPENED TO HAVE AN INTERVIEW WITH HIM
AND I ASKED HIM TO TELL ME ABOUT LOVE
I THOUGHT MAYBE I WAS WRONG MAYBE I'D FORGOTTEN WHAT OBJECTIVITY WAS
BUT HERE'S WHERE IT REALLY COUNTED WHAT REALLY STUCK WITH ME
AND IN FACT THE OPPOSITE HAS HAPPENED
ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST
SEND IT OUT THERE
IT WORKED IN THE UNITED STATES IT DIDN'T WORK IN FRANCE IT HASN'T WORKED IN GERMANY
SO IT'S PRETTY STRESSFUL RIGHT NOW
I'M VERY PROUD TO SAY I GOT HIS FIRST INTERNATIONAL INTERVIEW
AND HE SAID I LOVE MY WIFE SHE IS PART OF ME WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER FOR DECADES
BUT I THINK IN THIS REGARD THAT SO MUCH OF IT IS ALSO ABOUT TECHNOLOGY THAT THE TECHNOLOGY HAS TO ALSO
AND WHAT HAVE WE JUST LEARNED IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS
THAT ACTUALLY THERE HAS BEEN A MAJOR PROBLEM IN THAT REGARD AND NOW THEY'RE HAVING TO INVESTIGATE IT AND
IT WAS YESTERDAY
HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE THAT
I WAS YOUNG THEN
IT WAS ABOUT 25 YEARS AGO
IT WORRIED ME THAT I WAS BEING ACCUSED OF THIS
OR HAVE THEY BEEN VERY INADEQUATELY PREPARED
SO WHAT DOES IT MEAN
SO WHAT WE NEED GIVEN JUST THIS SUB SELECTION OF REASONS IS REALLY A MULTIFACETED APPROACH TO ADDRESS
AND WITHIN MINUTES OF RELEASING THIS PARTICULAR APPLICATION 15 DIFFERENT WHITE HATS HAD ALREADY
AT THE SAME TIME WE ALSO SEE ON HACKERONE AND MOSTLY ON WOOYUN A LOT OF PROGRAMS THAT DO NOT
FOR THIS KIND OF PURPOSE THIS DATA CAN BE VERY VALUABLE
BUT FIRST THE BAD NEWS
LET ME ILLUSTRATE THIS PROBLEM OF THIS WELL MOTIVATED WELL CAPABLE ATTACKER BY USING A QUOTE FROM
AT THE SAME TIME I'M ALSO TRYING TO ASSESS A POTENTIALLY POWERFUL PATHWAY TO IMPROVE THAT
OFTENTIMES IT'S QUITE SENSITIVE DATA
SO WHAT I WANT TO DO IN THE FOLLOWING IS TO DELVE A LITTLE BIT DEEPER INTO THE DATA TO GIVE YOU SOME ADDITIONAL INSIGHTS
THE PROGRAM OR PARTICIPATION MODEL OF WOOYUN IS MUCH BROADER IN THIS SENSE
LAST YEAR FACEBOOK RELEASED A NEW WEB MESSENGER APP THAT ACTUALLY INCLUDED AN IMPLEMENTATION MISTAKE
ON THE OTHER HAND WE HAVE WOOYUN WHERE ANY HACKER CAN SUBMIT ANY KIND OF VULNERABILITY ABOUT ANY
SO THAT'S GOOD
HOW WELL ARE THESE COMPANIES ACTUALLY SAFEGUARDING OUR INFORMATION
WHAT WE ARE ALSO DOING IS TO WORK ON MAKING THE INFORMATION THAT WE ARE COLLECTING PRESENTABLE AND
ANOTHER ISSUE THAT WE FIND INTERESTING IS TO EXPLORE THE DIFFERENT BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS OF THESE WHITE HAT RESEARCHERS
AFTER ALL THEY ASKED FOR THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE WHITE HAT RESEARCHERS
SO REDISCOVERY CAN BE HAPPENING VERY QUICKLY AND IT CAN BE A VERY POWERFUL MEAN
ON THE OTHER HAND ON WOOYUN WE SEE THE OPPOSITE
SO THE QUESTION ARISES
AND ONE THING THAT I WANT TO FOCUS ON IS A POTENTIALLY POWERFUL ROLE OF EXTERNAL SECURITY RESEARCHERS
AND IF THIS PROCESS REPEATS OVER AND OVER AGAIN THEN WE ARE HOPING THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY
AT THE SAME TIME IT IS NECESSARY TO THEN ALSO PREEMPT THE ACTIVITIES OF BLACK HATS
FINALLY THE QUESTION ARISES
WE ARE GOING TO BE PERSISTENT WE ARE GOING TO KEEP COMING AND COMING AND COMING
ALMOST ALL OF LARGE COMPANIES AND THE MAJORITY OF SMALL BUSINESSES ARE NOW OFFERING WEB SERVICES TO THEIR
BUT STILL THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE THE KIND OF BREACHES THAT YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT AT ALL
WE SEE THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF COMPANIES ARE COERCED TO PARTICIPATE THROUGH THE SUBMISSIONS OF WHITE HAT RESEARCHERS
SO DOING THESE INTERACTIONS WE ARE SHARING A LOT OF DATA ABOUT OURSELVES
GIVEN THESE DIFFERENT PARTICIPATION PATTERNS OUR EXPLANATION IS THAT INDEED THE ORGANIZATIONS ARE BETTER PREPARED
AND WE STILL SEE THERE THAT WHITE HAT RESEARCHERS DO A LOT OF WORK AND SUBMITTING A LARGE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT
THIS IS KNOWN AS THE COOLIDGE EFFECT
WHY IS THAT
WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE WHEN SCIENTIST EXAMINED FORMER INTERNET ADDICTS THEY FOUND THAT
THE KEY TO SUCCESS IN THE WORLD ECONOMY THE UNITED STATES' SUCCESS IN THE WORLD ECONOMY IS INNOVATION
WE CAN MAKE A START
AS A NATION IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO US
THERE ARE MANY OTHER PROJECTS
ONE KEY OF CREATIVITY IS TO NOT LOCK ON THAT FIRST IDEA
BECAUSE THE ACT OF WRITING YOUR IDEA DOWN IS ALREADY A FILTER
BUT IS IT CREATIVE
THE DEFINITION OF CREATIVITY THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE GO WITH IS APPROPRIATE NOVELTY
THIS IS SOMETHING YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT AHEAD OF TIME
I KNOW IT HAS FOR ME
THAT THIS PRECIOUS RESOURCE CALLED WATER IS SOMETHING WE ALL HAVE TO SHARE
ON THE OTHER HAND SKIN CANCER CELLS BECAUSE THEY GROW SO RAPIDLY AND CONSUME SO MUCH ENERGY
AS A RESULT THEY ARE PREVENTING THE ONSET OF SKIN CANCER WITHOUT AFFECTING ANY OF THE SURROUNDING TISSUE
WHAT OTHER FACTORS AFFECT SKIN DEVELOPMENT
I WANTED TO SEE WHAT WOULD PHYSICALLY HAPPEN TO THESE CELLS IF I WERE TO REMOVE THIS MCAT
AND I OFTEN WOULD SAY TO MYSELF EVEN IN MY DARKEST HOUR
WHAT WOULD MADIBA DO
AND YOU'LL CLOSE THE SALE
OR IT JUST FEELS WEIRD TO YOU WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IT
ANY GUESSES HOW BIG IS THAT NUMBER
SO THAT IS MY STORY BUT I'M ABSOLUTELY SURE THAT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU CARES ABOUT
SO I'LL PAINT A PICTURE
BUT WE CAN DESCRIBE IT ALL VERY WELL USING MATHEMATICS
IT'S NOT INTERACTED WITH IT AT ALL
AND HOW DO YOU DO THIS
IT TOTALLY DOESN'T BY THE WAY
IT'S NOT SMASHED IT
SO NUMBER ONE
WE DO UNDERSTAND QUANTUM PHYSICS VERY WELL AND YOU'D KIND OF HOPE THAT WE DID IF IT FORMS THE
WELL THAT'S ACTUALLY WRONG
AND IT'S OUR JOB TO EXPLAIN THE INFORMATION IN TERMS THAT THEY ALREADY UNDERSTAND
DON'T GO TOO FAR DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE
SO IT'S FASCINATING THAT SOMETHING CAN BE SO COUNTERINTUITIVE ON ONE HAND BUT YET CAN BE SO
THERE'S BEEN A WHOLE HOST OF OTHER TECHNOLOGIES THAT COME ABOUT BECAUSE OF OUR UNDERSTANDING OF QUANTUM PHYSICS
AND THERE'S THIS OTHER SOUND BITE YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD ABOUT QUANTUM PHYSICS
SO LET ME GET A SHOW OF HANDS
BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT THIS IS COMPLETELY WRONG IT'S THE WRONG WAY AROUND BECAUSE AT THAT POINT IN TIME THERE'S
BUT I THINK THAT'S OK AND IN FACT MY FEARS WERE COMPLETELY UNWARRANTED
SO I THINK WE SHOULD NEVER EVER FEEL BAD ABOUT NOT KNOWING SOMETHING AND WE SHOULD NEVER FEEL BAD ABOUT ASKING
THERE'S SO MUCH GOOD INFORMATION OUT THERE THESE DAYS
5 ON HIS FARM
AND IN THE FIRST PLACE THE FIRST THING TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT SOIL IS NOT DIRT
SO THE WAY WES HAS PUT THIS IS THAT WE ARE SIMPLY STOPOVERS BETWEEN SOIL AND SOIL
AND THEN WHEN YOU GO BACK TO PLANTING FOOD CROP AGAIN YOU INCORPORATE THAT INTO THE SOIL AND PUT
TO PROTECT FROM THE OXYGEN IN THE AIR
THAT'S VERY NICE
THINNER THAN A HUMAN HAIR EASILY
AND ADDED BONUS IT'S CALORIE FREE
NANOCELLULOSE IS TYPICALLY AROUND 99 WATER WHEN WE MAKE IT IN THE LAB
IN 2015 ALONE WE MADE ABOUT 322 MILLION METRIC
DID WE MANAGE
THE RESULTING PRODUCT WOULD BE
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WE USE PLASTICS IN FOOD PACKAGING
THAT HAPPENS RATHER QUICKLY ONCE I GET MY HANDS ON SOME
YOU ONLY HAVE TO GO OUT YOUR DOOR
THE CHINESE HAVE PROPOSED AS YOU'RE AWARE SEVERAL MAJOR
I'M SURE THEY CAN DO IT IF THEY WANT TO DO IT
SO THAT'S A HUGE PROJECT THERE
ONE PART IS ABOUT HISTORY
AND THROUGH THIS PROCESS IN A SIMPLE WAY THE CHINESE LEARNED THE SKILLS OF BUILDING A
CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT THE FUTURE WORLD WILL LOOK LIKE
AND THE REASON IS THAT WE WANTED THIS TO BE A REALLY IMPORTANT STATION WITHIN THE WEST END BECAUSE FROM HERE RATHER THAN
SO TO GO TO COVENT GARDEN YOU GOT THE COLOURFUL ONES
HIS TRADEMARK IS A STRIPE IT'S AN 87 MIL STRIPE THAT HE USES
4 MILLION IT IS AS BIG AS IT HAS EVER BEEN
50 YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
I'M JUST GOING TO WALK
IT WAS THE FLAVOR OF THE DAY IN THE 60S AND 70S
EVERYTHING IS NATURAL
PEOPLE DON'T DO THAT
MOM WAS A CELERY
IF I DON'T DRIVE IT'S GOING TO TAKE ME 3 HOURS TO GET HOME
YOU CAN HAVE AN ACCIDENT
SO YOU DON'T HAVE A STEAK
VERY HEALTHY CELERY
DRIVING IS DANGEROUS
BUT YOU NEVER HAVE AN ODD NUMBER OF COPIES
WE HAVE TO ENGAGE WITH THE MACHINERY OF GOVERNMENT
THEY'RE USING THEIR HANDS
SO SCOTT WAS SPEAKING PERSON TO PERSON
AND THERE'S A GENERATION OUT THERE THAT'S GROWN UP ON THE INTERNET AND THEY KNOW THAT IT'S NOT THAT HARD TO DO THINGS
AND IN THIS CASE A NEIGHBOR SAW IT
IT CONNECTED THOSE TWO PEOPLE
IT'S PROBABLY THE SMALLEST OF THE 21 APPS THAT THE FELLOWS WROTE LAST YEAR
AND THAT'S NOTHING
I HAVE DONE WRONG
WHAT CAN CREATURES LIKE US KNOW OF SUCH THINGS
HE TOOK SOME MONEY WE'LL TAKE HIS MONEY
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU HOLD SACRED
END STAGE LUNG CANCER
THERE WAS NOTHING SIGNED
SHARECROPPING IS WHAT MAKES THE WORLD GO ROUND ON THE EASTERN PLAINS
I WAS HANDING UP FOOD TO THE HOMELESS IN DETROIT
AND ONE OF THE WAYS THEY CAN BE TROUBLESOME IS THAT THEY'RE CHANGING MEANING
I HOPE THAT WHAT YOU CAN DO IS FIND LANGUAGE CHANGE NOT WORRISOME
WE CAN GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE RANGE OF OPINIONS ABOUT CONTESTED USAGE
AND THEN THEY STOP TALKING
TO SHOW YOU WHAT I MEAN WE'LL LOOK AT AN EXAMPLE
THAT WORD MIGHT BE SLANGY THAT WORD MIGHT BE INFORMAL THAT WORD MIGHT BE A WORD THAT YOU THINK IS ILLOGICAL
LANGUAGE JUST DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY
WELL YOU KNOW WHAT
OR DO YOU FIND IT FUN
NOW HERE IS WHAT I DO TO FILL OUT THE BALLOT
ARE YOU BOTHERED BY LANGUAGE FADS AND LANGUAGE CHANGE
AND I THINK A WORD THAT THEY'RE WATCHING RIGHT NOW IS YOLO
WHEN PEOPLE MEET ME AT PARTIES AND THEY FIND OUT THAT I'M AN ENGLISH PROFESSOR WHO SPECIALIZES IN
I'M GOING TO DO THIS AS A SHOW OF HANDS
AGAIN A SHOW OF HANDS
AND SO I WAS WORKING WITH
IT'S LIKE PEOPLE ARE SAILING INTO A HEADWIND ALL THE TIME
THAT'S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS OF THE TEST
AND THE THIRD PRINCIPLE IS THIS THAT HUMAN LIFE IS INHERENTLY CREATIVE
CULTURE IS AN ORGANIC TERM ISN'T IT
I'M NOT HERE TO ARGUE AGAINST SCIENCE AND MATH
IT SHOULDN'T OBSTRUCT IT WHICH OF COURSE IT OFTEN DOES
THEY RECOGNIZE THAT YOU CAN'T IMPROVE EDUCATION IF YOU DON'T PICK GREAT PEOPLE TO TEACH AND KEEP GIVING THEM CONSTANT
NO I'M FINE
IT'S WHY HUMAN CULTURE IS SO INTERESTING AND DIVERSE AND DYNAMIC
NOTHING GROWS THERE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T RAIN
IT'S WHY WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT R SUM S
IT'S THE COMMON CURRENCY OF BEING A HUMAN BEING
CHILDREN ARE NATURAL LEARNERS
YOU SEE IN THE END EDUCATION IS ABOUT LEARNING
I'VE TRAVELED THE WHOLE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF THIS COUNTRY
ECONOMY OVER 10 YEARS OF NEARLY A TRILLION DOLLARS
A WORLD THAT DEMANDS WE BE MORE THAN NICE SOMETIMES
NICE BY ITSELF IS PARSLEY
IF HE SAW BANE DESTROY GOTHAM AND CHANGED THE SUBJECT TO THE WEATHER
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN FASCINATED BY RIGHT AND WRONG
SUCCESS IN YOUR LIFE YOUR RELATIONSHIPS IN YOUR FRIENDSHIPS IN YOUR MARRIAGE PARENTING YOUR
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU EAT THAT FOOD AND THAT'S YOUR EXERCISE REGIMEN
YOU CAN SLIP AND FALL
I'M GOING TO MAKE A CHANGE
NOT ONE CAT
ELEGANCE MEETS VIOLENCE
MAYBE IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH CONFLICT RESOLUTION
ACTUALLY IT'S THE INTERNET OF EVERYTHING
IT'S A VERY HOT PLACE
CITIES ALL OVER THE WORLD ARE COSTING A LOT MORE MONEY
WHEN YOU HAVE A SMART PERSON AND YOU HAVE SMART INFRASTRUCTURE NOW YOU CAN DEVELOP INNOVATION
SO WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT
WHY SHOULD WE GET AWAY FROM THESE ARGUMENTS
BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY DANGEROUS
IS THE ANSWER TO JUST GIVE UP ON THE IDEA OF DEMOCRACY
WELL OBVIOUSLY NOT
IN AFGHANISTAN IT COULD HAVE MEANT INSTEAD OF CONCENTRATING ON THE BIG PRESIDENTIAL AND PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS WE SHOULD
THE MAIN GOAL WAS TO FIND THE TOXIN
WHAT KIND OF WORLD WAS THIS
AND HE HAD A SUGGESTION WHY OUR DATA WAS WRONG
THE PEOPLE ON TOP THE ONES THAT MAKE DECISIONS DIRECTORS AND MINISTERS DID NOT WANT TO CONTINUE THIS
HE SAID WELL THOSE DOG OWNERS THEY PROBABLY ARE LYING ABOUT THE DOG FOOD THAT THEY FEED
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO I RECEIVED A PHONE CALL THAT PULLED ME INTO AN INVESTIGATION AND
THE RESPONSE WAS AN IMMEDIATE DENIAL
BUT WE KNOW THAT NOT ALL POLICE OFFICERS ARE OVERWEIGHT
THERE'S A LINE OF RESEARCH CALLED GENDER PIPELINE RESEARCH AND IT SAYS THIS
STOP BUYING THOSE MAGAZINES THAT MARGINALIZE WOMEN
REPORT THESE INSTANCES OF SEXIST MEDIA TO PLACES LIKE THE NAME IT CHANGE IT CAMPAIGN SPONSORED
SHE WORKED FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AS A POLICE OFFICER
SHE ASKED ME ABOUT MY RESEARCH
WE HAVE TO WRITE LETTERS TO THE EDITORS
YOU'VE SEEN THESE
YOU WOULDN'T WANT YOUR DAUGHTERS TREATED THAT WAY
MY SISTER TERRY FOR EXAMPLE IS ONE OF THE FITTEST PEOPLE I KNOW
BUT WHEN WE GET INTO THE VOTING BOOTH WE SAY NO
WOMEN IN THE PUBLIC LIGHT
THINGS LIKE WHAT PART OF THE WORLD WORRIES YOU THE MOST
AND IT FOUND THAT 26 OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE ANGRY OR UPSET WITH
AND AS SHE LEFT SHE SMILED AT ME WARMLY AND SHE SAID YOU KNOW I GIVE YOU A LOT OF CREDIT FOR WHAT YOU'RE
YOU WOULDN'T WANT YOURSELF SPOKEN LIKE THAT ABOUT
YOU'RE LEANING IN
BECAUSE WHEN WE DO SHE AND WE WILL MAKE IT HAPPEN
WE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE ENGAGED IN POWERFUL IMAGINATION OF BREAKING
AND ALTHOUGH I THINK THAT'S TRUE I ALSO THINK THAT IF EVERY SINGLE TIME A WOMAN ENTERS THE PIPELINE SHE
WELL I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S TRUE
AND SHE WAS STEPPING DOWN AS SECRETARY OF STATE AND BARBARA WALTERS ASKED HER SOME REALLY GREAT QUESTIONS
YOU WOULDN'T WANT YOUR MOTHER SPOKEN LIKE THAT ABOUT
MY HEART SANK BECAUSE I THOUGHT IF YOU DON'T THINK A WOMAN IS GOING TO BE PRESIDENT IN YOUR LIFETIME MAYBE YOU'RE
WE HAVE TO CALL OUT THIS TREATMENT BY EXPOSING THIS MEDIA FOR WHAT IT IS
THE COLLEGE PROFESSOR MY FAVORITE USUALLY SLIGHTLY GRAYING VERY DIGNIFIED
BUT IT ISN'T LONG BEFORE OUR DAUGHTERS GO TO SCHOOL AND THEY OPEN UP THEIR SOCIAL STUDIES BOOKS
WE ELECTED BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
AND YOU KNOW WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'VE SEEN THESE PORTRAITS
SO WHEN WILL WE HAVE A WOMAN PRESIDENT
BUT I JUST DON'T THINK A WOMAN IS GOING TO BE PRESIDENT IN MY LIFETIME
HE SAID WELL I JUST TOLD YOU I FAILED MY EXAMS
LATER ON HUNGARIAN COMPOSER B LA BART K SPENT YEARS TRAVELING IN THE EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRYSIDE
AND THE WOMAN HAS NOT CRIED SINCE
THEIR CALM DOWN SYSTEM IN THEIR BRAIN DOESN'T BEGIN TO COME ON LINE UNTIL
TALKING WITH HIM IS THE SECOND KEY POINT
YOU HAD NO TRAINING AS A WRITER FORMALLY BUT YOU HUSTLED YOUR WAY IN
THEN CAME THE MOVIES
YOU START PEOPLE FOR THE AMERICAN WAY
THIS IS STUFF WE TAKE FOR GRANTED TODAY
SO LET ME EXPLAIN THESE THINGS
IT SPREADS QUICKLY
I KNOW WE DON'T WANT TO FOR A MINUTE THINK THAT IT'S OUR OWN BEHAVIOR CONTRIBUTING TO
BUT IT IS HARMFUL TO US ALL THE SAME
THINK OF SOMETHING MORE LIKE ZIKA
YOU AND I WE'VE BECOME INFECTED AND WE NOT EVEN KNOW IT
NOW IMPLICIT BIAS IS DIFFERENT FROM EXPLICIT BIAS
EXPLICIT BIAS IS A BIAS THAT WE KNOW WE HAVE AND WE FREELY ADMIT TO OTHERS
I FOUND OUT THAT I AM ONE OF 45 MILLION WOMEN WHO HAVE WHAT'S CALLED
ITS OK YOU JUST NEED TO KNOW HOW TO TAKE CARE OF THEM
YOU KNOW WHAT
IT'S IN BETWEEN YOUR BREASTS
MAYBE IF MY CANCER HAD BEEN FOUND A YEAR BEFORE WHEN IT WAS SMALLER AND EASY TO
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAID
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THAT WAY
PAULA GORDON'S STUDY
I KNOW WHAT'S INSIDE ME I KNOW WHEN SOMETHING'S WRONG
I'M JUST GOING TO SEE A BREAST SURGEON
I MEAN HE'S GOT TO KNOW MORE
YOU KNOW WHAT
I WAS LISTENING TO THIS ARGUMENT AND I SUDDENLY THOUGHT THIS IS NOT WHY I BECAME A PHOTOGRAPHER
THEY WOULD COME IN AND LIFT HER HAND AND PUT IT ON THE WOUND AND SAY MAKE IT BETTER MUMMY
AS THE MONTHS WENT ON I HAD 37 OPERATIONS IN MY FIRST YEAR AND THROUGH THAT RECOVERY AGAIN I WATCHED THE
ON THE LAST DAY I WAS THERE I GOT A PHONE CALL
A PHOTOGRAPH THAT YOU TOOK IN AFGHANISTAN INSPIRED ME AND EVERY DAY I HAD THAT PHOTOGRAPH ON MY WALL
I WAS THE WORLD'S WORST BOXER
EVERY DAY POLITICIANS USE NEGATIVE RHETORIC FOR THEIR OWN
HE SAID GILES YOU TAKE A PUNCH VERY WELL
THEN I ALSO DISCOVERED THAT AYA WAS NOT A VICTIM
BUT AS YOU'LL LEARN I'M QUITE A STUBBORN CHARACTER AND I WASN'T SURE THAT MY LACK OF SPORTING ABILITY WOULDN'T GET IN THE
I WAS MOSTLY INTERESTED IN THE MOST VULNERABLE THOSE WITH DISABILITIES THE ELDERLY SINGLE MOTHERS
WHEN IMAN WALKED IN SHE SHOUTED HEY DONKEY PICK ME UP
I SAID WHERE IS SHE
I SAY THE BIGGEST STRUGGLE IS THAT IN THOSE CAMPS I SEE HUMANITY I SEE LOVE I SEE COMPASSION
AS I STARTED MY REHABILITATION AS I WAS WORKING TO WALK AGAIN THE ONLY THING ON MY MIND WAS I HAD
TO PUT THAT IN CONTEXT LAST YEAR DURING THE EUROPEAN REFUGEE CRISIS CLOSE TO A MILLION
THE REFUGEE CRISIS AFFECTS ALL OF US
THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS
ANOTHER THING THAT I'D GROWN INCREASINGLY CYNICAL ABOUT WAS THE WAY WOMEN WERE PORTRAYED IN THE MAGAZINES I WORKED FOR
I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO WITH MY FUTURE
SO WITH THIS OLYMPUS OM 10 CAMERA I ACTUALLY TAUGHT MYSELF PHOTOGRAPHY LYING IN A HOSPITAL BED
I USED TO PHOTOGRAPH THE DOCTORS NURSES MY FRIENDS ANYONE WHO WOULD COME IN
THEY SAID SHE'S IN THE SAME TENT WHERE YOU LAST SAW HER
THEY WON'T BE THERE
THAT WE'RE BUILDING OUR NATURAL DEFENSES PUTTING PEOPLE TO WORK RESTORING OUR NATURAL SYSTEMS
AND READING THAT BOOK MADE ME REEXAMINE THAT FEAR BECAUSE
WE THINK LOCAL AND WE ACT LOCAL
I STARTED MY FIRM TO HELP COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY REALIZE THEIR OWN POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE
AND I'M A GROWN WOMAN NOW AND I HAVE LEARNED A FEW THINGS ALONG THE WAY
I NEED TO EXPLAIN WHAT I MEAN BY THAT
SO YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO HELP HIM OUT
AND WHEN WE DO THAT OUR NEIGHBORS BE THEY NEXT DOOR OR IN THE NEXT OR NEXT COUNTRY
HAS ITS ISSUES BUT I WILL TALK ABOUT L
AND IT'S SINCE MOVED TO HER BONES AND HER BRAIN
AND WE WANTED TO CREATE HUNDREDS OF JOBS
WE KNOW WHAT IS MEANT WHEN WE SAY THAT SOMETHING IS ALIVE
3 LIGHT YEARS AWAY FROM US
AND THESE SIGNALS CAN TRAVEL IN GREAT DISTANCES AND CARRY A LOT OF INFORMATION
WE'RE READING THE BOOK OF LIFE
AND WE AREN'T GOING TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE KINDS OF EXPENSES THAT WE HAVE TO CREATE BLOCKBUSTER
IT'S GOING TO PICK UP SPEED
PEOPLE CAN TRY AND BAN THESE THINGS
IT'S GOING TO CHANGE THE WAY WE MANAGE AND ALTER OUR EMOTIONS
AND WHEN IT DOES IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THAT BIG A DEAL
THAT'S WHAT WE DO
YOU JUST HAVE TO LOOK AT THE HUMAN GENOME PROJECT
HUMANITY IS GOING TO GO DOWN THIS PATH
IT'S GOING TO CHANGE THE WAY WE HAVE CHILDREN
9 PERCENT OF THE LETTERS IN THE CODE ARE THE SAME
AND IT'S GOING TO BE USED FOR DIET AS WELL AND NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS AND SUCH
BUT WHO IS GOING TO PAY FOR ALL THIS
THERE ARE THREE OBVIOUS WAYS OF DOING THIS
OF COURSE THERE IS GOING TO BE GENETIC ENGINEERING
BUT WHEN SOMETHING IS FEASIBLE IN THOUSANDS OF LABORATORIES ALL OVER THE WORLD WHICH IS GOING TO BE THE CASE WITH THESE TECHNOLOGIES WHEN
AND THAT'S WHERE ABOUT HALF OF OUR DRUGS COME
AND IF YOU DON'T WHO ARE YOU GOING TO BE
ANOTHER THING IS THAT WE'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS KNOWLEDGE
IT'S GOING TO PROBABLY CHANGE THE HUMAN LIFESPAN
THE FIRST OF THEM IS THE OBVIOUS ONE THE SILICON REVOLUTION WHICH YOU ALL ARE VERY VERY FAMILIAR WITH
THAT'S THE WAY THESE THINGS WORK
AND IT WON'T BE DONE
TO IMAGINE THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO USE THESE TECHNOLOGIES WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE IS AS MUCH A DENIAL
WE'RE DECIPHERING THE CODE OF CODES
I DON'T HAVE ANY SLIDES
THIS IS WHERE IT'S REALLY CENTRAL TO OUR LIVES
AND THAT IS WHY THEY ARE SO VERY TROUBLING TO SO MANY PEOPLE WHO WOULD PULL BACK IN
NOW I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A WHOLE LOT OF HYPE ABOUT OUR POWER TO CONTROL BIOLOGY
THEY UNDOUBTEDLY WILL
DIRECTLY GOING IN IT'S A LITTLE BIT FURTHER AWAY BUT NOT THAT FAR AWAY GOING IN AND ALTERING THE
IT MERELY LEVELED THE PLAYING FIELD
HOWEVER IT IS ALREADY CLEAR THAT YOUR ANCESTORS' SURVIVAL THROUGH MASS EXTINCTION
HOW DID WE ALL GET SO LUCKY
BY BEING HERE LISTENING ALIVE A MEMBER OF A GROWING SPECIES YOU ARE ONE OF
THE EXTINCTION WAS A FILTER
SO ALL I CAN DO IS KEEP REPEATING IT IN DIFFERENT TONES AND HOPE YOU WON'T NOTICE
WHY ARE THEY JUST SITTING HERE
IT'S GOOD FOR US
YOU'RE TERRIBLE AT THIS
FOR EXAMPLE IN THE FAMOUS STUDY OF LONDON TAXI DRIVERS THE VISUAL SPATIAL MAPPING PART OF THE BRAIN IS
I LOVE YOU SHAUNA
I LOVE YOU SHAUNA
ALMOST ALL THE PEOPLE WE WERE WORKING WITH REGARDLESS OF THEIR AGE THEIR GENDER THEIR BACKGROUND WERE TALKING
I DON'T WANT TO GET BETTER
AND THEN NOT ONLY WAS I JUDGING MYSELF I STARTED JUDGING EVERYONE EVEN THE MONKS
IN FACT CHECK IT OUT FOR YOURSELF
BUT NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRIED MY MIND KEPT WANDERING OFF
AND AT THIS POINT I REALLY STARTED TO JUDGE MYSELF
THEY ARE PRETTY HARD NOSED BECAUSE I'M ASKING THEM TO PUT THEIR MONEY TO PUT
OH MY GOD THE POPULATION IS DECLINING THEREFORE IT'S TERRIBLE
JAPAN JAPAN JAPAN
DEMOGRAPHIC SWEET SPOT
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT
IT ALSO MEANS THAT OF THE YOUNG GENERATION ALMOST 1 IN 2 PEOPLE HAS NEVER HAD
THIS HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THAT IS DRIVEN BY THE POPULATION DYNAMICS OF JAPAN
I CAN GIVE YOU ANOTHER EXAMPLE
HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THAT
I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT INNOVATION
THERE IS MORE MONEY AROUND
BUT I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED WHEN I GOT MY LETTER INVITING ME FOR MY
THAT S ALL IT IS
WHY WOULDN'T WE START TO THINK ABOUT
WHETHER LIKE MYSELF IT'S A PARTIAL BLINDNESS OR A SIGHT IMPAIRMENT MAYBE HEARING LOSS
AND I BECAME REALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT THAT ABOUT BEING AN ENTREPRENEUR
I'M TOO WEAK
WHY DID SHE HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL THAT
SHE WANTS TO REUNITE WITH HER FAMILY THERE
WE DON'T TRUST ANYBODY
SO WE WENT BACK AND FORTH NEGOTIATING
NIGHT PASSED NEXT MORNING HUNDREDS OF THE FARMERS FROM THAT COOPERATIVE WENT TO
SO EVENTUALLY WE WANT TO HAVE A SUITE OF PRODUCTS AND PROGRAMS THAT WORK WITH OTHER BRANDS AND SPORTS LEAGUES TO
AND I SAW MARK'S FACE JUST LOSE ALL OF ITS EXUBERANCE
HOW WOULD YOU GO ABOUT DOING THAT
THEY LOOK AT ME LIKE I'M CRAZY THEY CHECK THE CALENDAR TO MAKE SURE IT'S NOT APRIL FOOLS
AT THE END OF EVERY GAME I'D CALCULATE MY STATISTICS CLOSE MY EYES AND IMAGINE STUART SCOTT READING THOSE
I STARTED TUTORING KIDS
THERE'S A FEELING OF INEVITABILITY THAT SOMETHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN LONDON
IN THE SAME WAY WE CAN SEE NOW IT'S A MISTAKE LEAVING POLITICS UP TO THE POLITICIANS
I STUMBLED ACROSS ONE OF THE FIVE DIFFERENT FACEBOOK PAGES WHICH WERE GOING
WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OUT ON THE STREETS
I FIND OUT ABOUT THE LONDON PLANS IN THE WAY AS MOST PEOPLE DO
AND NONE OF THIS HAD TO BE CONSCIOUSLY DIRECTED
BUT THERE'S ANOTHER DIMENSION TO THIS WHICH I THINK IS WORTH THINKING ABOUT
FOR ONE THING YOU ARE AIMING TO OCCUPY OUTSIDE THE STOCK EXCHANGE
I THINK WE'D MADE PROVISION FOR A GENERATOR TO TURN UP FOR DAY TWO IF WE MANAGED TO STAY OVERNIGHT
AND I THINK ONLY BY DOING THAT CAN WE REALLY BASE THE STANDS OF OUR DEMOCRACY
WE HAD NO IDEA HOW
WE HAD NO IDEA THAT WE WERE GOING TO END UP OUTSIDE SAINT PAUL'S CATHEDRAL FOR FIVE MONTHS
IT'S ALMOST INEVITABLE
IT WAS WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO A YOUNG WELSH AMERICAN SOLDIER IN MILITARY DETENTION IN THE
AND IT SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO STAND
AND ALTHOUGH I DIDN'T REALISE IT AT THE TIME OR FULLY APPRECIATED IT AT THE TIME ONCE YOU HAVE A DEEP SENSE THAT
CUTTING OTHERS MIGHT MAKE THE BOMB EXPLORE
THERE ARE SPOTS ON THE PAPER THAT ARE STICKY
AND WHEN IT FOLDS CORRECTLY THESE STICKY BITS END UP ON THE INSIDE
WILL HE BE ABLE TO BE NORMAL
AND THIS IS THE MESSAGE THAT WE WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU
HONESTLY WE WENT DOWN
NOBODY TAUGHT US HOW TO DEAL WITH SUCH KINDS OF DISABILITIES AND AS MANY QUESTIONS AS POSSIBLE STARTED TO
AND THAT HAS BEEN REALLY A TOUGH TIME
I MEAN AT THE END WILL HE BE ABLE TO WORK
YOU ARE WHO YOU ARE
AND IF WE CAN HOLD TWO THINGS WE CAN HOLD FOUR AND IF WE CAN HOLD FOUR WE CAN HOLD EIGHT AND IF WE CAN HOLD EIGHT WE CAN HOLD HUNDREDS
AM I AN AUNT
AT THE SAME TIME THERE'S NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT TO ME THAN THE KIDS IN MY LIFE SO I FOUND MYSELF IN A SITUATION THAT WE
STANCE ON GAYNESS OVER HER HERITAGE
MOMENT IN A DOCTOR'S OFFICE WHEN HE WENT TO PRESCRIBE THE SAME MEDICATION THAT MY GRANDFATHER WAS ON AT THAT TIME IN ORDER
I WAS SITTING IN CLASS WITH DR
AND I THANK HIM FOR THAT
DUN SAW ME THROUGH MY ENTIRE COLLEGE APPLICATION PROCESS
CHARLES DERRY WHO'S A VERY REVERED PERSON IN OUR FILM WORLD
I HOPE I GET TO CONTINUE TO MAKE FILMS
WE'RE DOING A TEDX
WE'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT IT
SHE SAW SOMETHING IN ME THAT I WASN'T ABLE TO SEE IN MYSELF
I GREW UP POOR BUT I FIT IN
I HAVE MY HEALTH
DUN SHE GAVE ME 5 DOLLARS IN GAS MONEY TO GET HOME FROM HIGH SCHOOL ONE DAY
DIFFERENT HOW EXACTLY
THERE ARE NO TIMEOUTS SCHEDULED INTERMISSIONS OR CUSHIONY CONVENIENT MOMENTS FOR
AND SO IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THE HUFFS AND PUFFS ROLLING OF EYES SHIFTING BODIES
OR JUST MAYBE EXPOSURE OR OTHERING COME THROUGH STATEMENTS THAT SOMEHOW SUGGEST YOU
THAT SAID LET ME REITERATE A FEW THINGS
YES THAT UNAVOIDABLE PLACE WHERE SOME HAVE AND MAY STILL VOICE
AND THEN IF I COULD BE SO BLESSED ASSUMING THAT AFTER HAVING ARRIVED IN SOME
AND SO AS A RESULT PEOPLE ARE LEFT COMFORTABLY UNKNOWLEDGEABLE UNAWARE AND UNABLE
THIS IS HOW WHO BELIEVE THEMSELVES TO HAVE THE BEST OF INTENTIONS COME TO BE SURPRISINGLY
SO LET'S GO WITH IT
AFTER ALL THE STELLAR REPUTATION OF THE COOL KIDS DEPENDS ON IT
NO THAT'S TOTALLY NOT HOW THAT WORKS
AND SO IT IS THEN THE DECIDEDLY COOL KIDS THAT DEFINE THE OTHERS
WHAT GOES ON IN THE BRAINS OF THOSE BABIES WHO GROW UP IN HOUSEHOLDS WHERE TWO LANGUAGES ARE SPOKEN
RESEARCH DOESN'T ACTUALLY SUPPORT THIS
WE ARE IN EUROPE AFTER ALL
THAT IT MAKES IT SLOWER
INSTEAD WHAT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN IS THAT IF WE CONSIDER THE PATTERNS IN BILINGUAL LEARNING THEY'RE ACTUALLY VERY VERY
I DON'T THINK IT DOES
I'M A RESEARCHER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON'S INSTITUTE FOR LEARNING AMP BRAIN SCIENCES I LABS FOR
IT ALLOWS US TO TALK TO MORE PEOPLE
IT ALSO HAS BEEN LINKED TO SEVERAL COGNITIVE AND SOCIAL ADVANTAGES AND IT DELAYS THE ONSET OF
WHAT I'LL TELL YOU TODAY IS THAT THE HUMAN BRAIN IS FULLY CAPABLE OF ACHIEVING NATIVE
I KNOW FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE
IT IS SO EASY TO FIND THE NEGATIVES IN SCHOOL
I KNOW IT CAN BE HARD TRUST ME I STRUGGLE WITH IT EVERYDAY
NOW AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT IS A VERY TIME CONSUMING LABOR INTENSIVE AND COSTLY PROCESS
IT CARRIES A VARIETY OF SENSORS AND THE PHOTO QUALITY OF SOME OF THESE SENSORS CAN BE AS HIGH AS
THERE IS NO LIFE POSSIBLE AT THE SURFACE OF MARS TODAY BUT IT MIGHT STILL BE HIDING UNDERGROUND
MARS MAY HOLD THAT SECRET FOR US
I'VE GOT SOME PEOPLE RAISING THEIR HANDS
I M CO PRODUCING A DOCUMENTARY CALLED SAVED BY LANGUAGE ABOUT A SEPHARDIC BOSNIAN BOY WHO SAVED HIS LIFE
WHICH IN LADINO MEANS TO BANG IF I HAD READ IT IN THE BOOK I PROBABLY WOULDN'T REMEMBER IT
MY FIRST LANGUAGE WAS RUSSIAN AND I LEARNED HOW TO READ AND WRITE IN RUSSIAN BEFORE ENGLISH
AND WE HAVE ANOTHER 170 LANGUAGES AT RISK OF EXTINCTION
WHEN WE LOSE THESE LANGUAGES WE LOSE CENTURIES WORTH OF ART MUSIC HISTORY
YOU HAVE TO THINK IN A DIFFERENT WAY
COMPANIES LIKE SESAME STREET AND SCHOOL HOUSE ROCK HAVE SUCCESSFULLY PUT EDUCATIONAL CONTENTS TO
BUT WE RE NOT GONNA STOP THERE
IN THE UNITED STATES WE'VE LOST 55 LANGUAGES SINCE 1997
THERE S A DEATH ROW FOR LANGUAGES AND IT HAS THREE THOUSAND PRISONERS
WE ALL KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO HEAR SONGS FROM OUR CHILDHOOD AND WE REMEMBER EXACTLY WHERE WE WERE
BUT WE MIGHT NOT REMEMBER WHAT WAS ON YOUR SHOPPING LIST YESTERDAY
THAT'S HOW OLD IT WAS
YOU BASICALLY MAKE A BIG FIRE OUTSIDE THROW SOME ROCKS IN THAT FIRE
OURS TEND TO BE 9
THANK YOU GUYS FOR YOUR ATTENTION
MY BEDROOM WALLS WEREN'T GOING TO MAGICALLY EXPAND
SO ONCE THE CITY SCHOOLED ME IN THE FINE ART OF DRESSING THE DECLUTTERING EXTENDED TO MY
WHAT'S MORE MY STUFF WAS LIMITED ON THAT SEMESTER
I HAD TO CREATE SPACE WITHIN THE CONFINES I WAS GIVEN AND IT WAS A SMALL BEDROOM PACKED WITH
SO I JUST WANT TO ASK TWO THINGS OF YOU BEFORE I WRAP UP
THE 1950S ERA SUPERMARKET CONTAINED 3000 DIFFERENT ITEMS BUT BY THE
I WAS RUTHLESS ABOUT IT AND THE RESULT WAS AWESOME
GONE WERE THE DAYS OF HEMMING AND HAWING IN FRONT OF A MIRROR WONDERING IF I LOOKED OK
HOW I CAME TO BELIEVE OTHERWISE HAS BEEN AN EYE OPENING EXPERIENCE
I WANTED MORE OF ALL OF IT
I WAS A CHILD OF THE 80S AND 90S
ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS THANK GOD FOR CURIOSITY BECAUSE AT 19 WANTING TO SEE THE WORLD I TRAVELED ABROAD TO INDIA WHERE I
UH I'M SORRY WAIT
I'S BASICALLY ME IN A ROOM WITH A CAMERA TALKING TO MYSELF ABOUT AFRICA AND HOPING THAT IT MAKES ANY
ON PAPER THESE COUNTRIES SEEM VERY DIFFERENT
I THINK I PAID LIKE 15 DOLLARS A MONTH FOR UNLIMITED ACCESS TO TWITTER
USERS CAN REACH SUITABLE BLOOD DONORS WITHIN A CERTAIN RADIUS DIRECTLY AND SEND THEM
SO THIS BEHAVIOR OF RISK AVOIDANCE IS A VERY OLD EVOLUTIONARY RESPONSE
THEY ADAPT VERY SIMPLE RULES AND THE RESULTING COMPLEX BEHAVIOR ALLOWS THEM TO RESIST
AND ONE OF THEM IS THE EXTRAORDINARY SOCIAL COMPLEXITY OF THE ANIMALS AROUND US AND
SO I SET OUT TO STUDY ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND ROBOTICS AND MY END OF STUDIES PROJECT
IF SHE DIES ON THE ROAD THE WHOLE GROUP IS AT RISK
IT'S GOOD FOR EVERYBODY
I SAID NO NO NO NO WE CAN'T
HE'D DOING QUITE WELL
I SAID NO YOU CAN IMAGINE
AND THEN I ASKED THE USUAL QUESTION IS IT A PRIORITY
THAT WAS MY STORY
I THOUGHT HOW MUCH MONEY DO I HAVE IN MY POCKET
SO WE CANNOT STAY HERE IT'S DANGEROUS
HE TOLD ME HE'S AT SCHOOL
WHICH UP UNTIL NOW HAS HAD THE LONGEST KNOWN INSECT MIGRATION
I KNOW THEY TRAVEL AT THE SAME ALTITUDE
THEY TRAVEL AT EXACTLY THE SAME TIME WITH THE SAME WINDS TO MAKE THE CROSSING
AND THE DRAGONFLIES ARE THERE
IT'S KNOWN ABOUT THE AMUR FALCON
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEWHERE TO BREED
IT'S QUITE INCREDIBLE
WAIT FOR THE GO
LITTLE LARVAE HATCH OUT IN FRESH WATER
THEY FEED ON OTHER LITTLE THINGS
IN THE NEXT 50 YEARS MORE THAN HALF OF THOSE
BUT WHAT DO WE DO FIRST
SOME PEOPLE MUST MAKE MORE MONEY SOME OTHERS LESS
SOME COMPANIES SUCCEED
FOR EXAMPLE IF THAT IS TRUE A BUS WITH 80 PASSENGERS HAS A RIGHT TO 80 TIMES
I DON'T WANT THEM RETHINKING WHAT SMART MEANS DOWN THE ROAD
IF SHE UNDERSTANDS HER EMOTIONS AND SHE CAN BE PRESENT IN HER EMOTIONS SHE WILL ALWAYS BE ABLE TO NAVIGATE HER WAY THROUGH
AND WHEN DOING SO HE'S CREATING HIS LIFE
I DON'T EXPECT ANY PART OF IT TO BE SKIPPED OVER
THIS IS THE TERM THAT ARMIES USE WHEN THEY'VE LOST A BATTLE
THIS IS ACTUALLY A BRAINWAVE SENSOR THAT'S READING THE ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY OF MY BRAIN AS I GIVE THIS TALK
WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO US ABOUT THE SUGAR PARTS WE'VE SHOWN YOU TODAY ISN'T THAT THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL BUT THAT THEY WERE
I HAD TO START DOING SOMETHING THAT WAS CREATING A MORE POSITIVE LIFE FOR MY SON AND FOR
1 BILLION PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY
WE'RE VERY SUSCEPTIBLE TO THAT
IF YOU GO DOWN YOUR HOUSE GOES DOWN
YOUR NEIGHBOR WOULD BE FINE EVERYONE AROUND YOU
IT'S A SOMEWHAT MORE INDIRECT WAY
THAT IS THE NOTION OF INVESTMENT
IT'S NOT EXACTLY A LOW COST PROPOSITION
THEY HAND OUT ALL KINDS OF BUSINESS TAX BREAKS
SO WHEN YOU LOOK FOR EXAMPLE AT METROPOLITAN AREAS SUCH AS THE BOSTON AREA MINNEAPOLIS ST
THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO PAY ME AS GOOD WAGES
SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN INVESTMENT THAT IN TERMS OF IMPACTS ON THE STATE ECONOMY IS
SO IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT IT WOULD COST IF EVERY STATE GOVERNMENT
SO CLEARLY THE PRODUCTIVITY OF FIRMS IN SILICON VALLEY HAS A LOT TO DO WITH THE SKILLS NOT ONLY OF THE WORKERS AT
YOU SACRIFICE NOW FOR A RETURN LATER
ANOTHER OBJECTION YOU SOMETIMES HEAR TO INVEST IN EARLY CHILDHOOD PROGRAMS IS CONCERN
AND SO THEY'LL BOTH UNDER INVEST BECAUSE EVERYONE'S GOING TO MOVE OUT
NOW THOSE PROGRAMS CAN MAKE SENSE IF THEY IN FACT INDUCE NEW LOCATION DECISIONS AND THE WAY THEY CAN
I'VE SPENT MOST OF MY CAREER RESEARCHING THESE PROGRAMS
I'VE TALKED TO A LOT OF DIRECTORS OF STATE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES ABOUT THESE ISSUES A LOT OF LEGISLATORS ABOUT THESE ISSUES
WHEN LEGISLATORS AND OTHERS THINK ABOUT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WHAT THEY FIRST OF ALL THINK ABOUT ARE BUSINESS TAX
WE ALL KNOW THAT
WELL MASS TIMBER PANELS THESE NEW PRODUCTS THAT WE'RE USING ARE MUCH LIKE THE LOG
THE SCALE OF THE CHALLENGE FOR ARCHITECTS AND FOR SOCIETY TO DEAL WITH IN BUILDING IS TO FIND A
MASS TIMBER PANELS ARE THOSE 24 DOT BRICKS
IF I ASKED YOU TO TAKE A MATCH AND LIGHT IT AND HOLD UP A LOG AND TRY TO GET THAT LOG TO GO ON FIRE IT
TO ME WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THE PRINCIPLE
HOW IS IT DIFFERENT FROM OTHER CROPS
THEY DO NOT
SO IN ANOTHER STUDY WE DID WE USED PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA ABOUT SEARCHES IN GOOGLE
WE WANT THIS TO BE CORRECT
RIGHT I AM FAILING MATHEMATICS SO SOMEBODY SHOULD PROBABLY FIX THIS QUICKLY
DON'T EVEN TRY IT
I'D LIKE TO GET THAT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE
AND ONE OF THE MOST COMMON THINGS I KEEP ON HEARING AND IT GOES OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS THAT WE ARE CLEVER
AS EXAMPLE I HAVE BEEN TOLD TO STAY IN THIS CIRCLE BECAUSE THIS IS THE BEST WAY ALL THE CAMERAS CAN CAPTURE MY ANGLE
IT WILL BE ABLE TO CAPTURE THE MINOR DETAILS GREAT
DEAR MIND SORRY FOR THINKING TOO MUCH
TIME DOESN'T HEAL ANYTHING
I WASN'T MUCH DIFFERENT
WE SAW EACH OTHER EVERY DAY
I'M FROM HUEYTOWN ALABAMA
THIS IS WHERE INTERNALIZED MISOGYNY COMES IN
YOU CAN HELP TOO WHETHER YOU ARE A FATHER BROTHER HUSBAND OR SON YOU CAN HELP BY EMPOWERING WOMEN
WHAT IS A GOPRO
SO I TURNED TO A SCRAPBOOK I HAVE I COLLECT PICTURES OR I TAKE PICTURES IN THE SCRAPBOOK
THE FIRST IS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OVERHEAD PROJECTORS AND WE TALK ABOUT MOOCS AND WE TALK ABOUT OPEN EDUCATIONAL
WE NEED TO START THE SPACE RACE AND PROTECT OURSELVES FROM SOME NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST
SO THAT'S KIND OF MY QUEST THAT IS MY DREAM AND THAT'S THE KIND OF PATH I WANT TO TAKE YOU ALONG WITH ON THIS PARTICULAR TALK
BUT OF COURSE LEARNING IS A LOT MORE THAN THAT
WE CAN'T WAIT FOR AN INNOVATION TO COME DOWN FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE AND BE BESTOWED UPON US TO SAVE OUR
I SEE ALL OF THESE INNOVATIONS THAT I'M TOLD OR OFFERED AS THIS IS A GREAT WAY TO INNOVATE WHAT YOU'RE
YOU'VE GOT SOME KIND OF WALL THERE YOU'VE SOME KIND OF UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU WANT TO GET ACROSS AND IT'S THE
I'VE GOT THESE INNOVATIONS THAT I'M LOOKING FOR AND I CAN ALSO SEE THAT SOME OF THESE WE'VE SEEN BEFORE IN FACT ONE OF
I GET TO TEACH UNIVERSITY PHYSICS CLASSES I GET TO RUN SCIENCE PROGRAMMES FOR KIDS AND THEIR FAMILIES
I ASK THE WORLD TO END SUFFERING BUT DO I SHOW UP FOR THOSE WHO ARE SUFFERING ON MY STREET CORNER
WHAT SHOULD I DO
START BY HAVING THE FIRST CONVERSATION AT YOUR OWN KITCHEN TABLE
SHE DID NOT SAY I'M NOT A CONGRESSMAN OR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SO HOW COULD I POSSIBLY
NEAR AND FAR PEOPLE GAVE THEIR DOLLARS THEY GAVE THEIR CENTS THEY GAVE THEIR HEARTS
ONE TO FEEL SO OVERWHELMED OR UNQUALIFIED WE DO NOTHING
PEACE CANNOT BE SHARED OR CREATED WITH OTHERS IF WE CANNOT FIRST GENERATE IT
ASK IS THIS FAIR
I DON'T NEED A PLASTIC BAG
WE GIVE THEM POSITIVE CHOICES
THEIR SCREAMING BEGINS YOU RAISE THE ROOF
YOUNG PEOPLE WHO FROM US NEED HOPE AND HIGH EXPECTATION
WHAT ARE YOU PASSIONATE ABOUT
ONE TIME I ASKED A CLIENT
HERE I AM ON MY THIRD DATE WITH MY WITTY RETORTS A DRESS THAT LEFT
SO WHAT DO YOU FIND SEXY ABOUT YOURSELF
YOU SEE IF THERE'S CHEMISTRY
NOW LET'S LOOK AT THE CONTINUUM IN OUR SOCIETY WHERE SEXUALITY IS MEASURED
COM JUST USED ONE AD WITH A COUPLE IN A WHEELCHAIR ONE AD
I'VE NEVER DATED SOMEONE ASIAN BEFORE
GENDER IS HOW SOMEONE PRESENTS THEMSELVES IN SOCIETY
WOMEN'S HEALTH BECAME SYNONYMOUS WITH REPRODUCTION
THIS NEW KNOWLEDGE IS THE GAME CHANGER AND
BUT MORE WOMEN DIE WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR OF HAVING A HEART ATTACK THAN MEN
SO WHY ARE WE DISCOVERING UNACCEPTABLE SIDE EFFECTS ON HALF THE POPULATION AFTER THAT
SO SOME MUCH NEEDED GUIDELINES OR RULES WERE SET INTO PLACE AND PART OF THAT WAS THIS DESIRE
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU THAT THE MEDICAL SCIENCE DISCOVERED OVER THE PAST CENTURY HAS BEEN BASED
HE GOT SO FRUSTRATED HE STARTED THROWING BEER CANS ACROSS THE STUDIO
HIS NAME IS BRIAN ENO
SOME OF CARSON'S UNDERGRADUATE SUBJECTS STRUGGLED WITH THAT
WE FEEL THAT THEY'RE GETTING IN THE WAY
THEY HELP US SOLVE PROBLEMS THEY HELP US BE MORE CREATIVE
SO PHIL COLLINS WAS PLAYING DRUMS ON AN EARLY BRIAN ENO ALBUM
MAKE A SUDDEN DESTRUCTIVE UNPREDICTABLE ACTION
CARLOS ALOMAR GREAT ROCK GUITARIST WORKING WITH ENO ON DAVID BOWIE'S LODGER ALBUM
IT'S HIS ROLE TO BE THE AWKWARD STRANGER
AND ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH HE CREATES THIS DISRUPTION IS THROUGH THIS REMARKABLE DECK OF
THESE DISTRACTIONS WERE ACTUALLY GRISTS TO THEIR CREATIVE MILL
THE OPERA HOUSE HAD PROVIDED THE WRONG INSTRUMENT
THE AUDITORIUM WAS EMPTY
CAN YOU DO THAT
AND I AM HAPPY WITH THE POSITIVE CHANGE I SEE
FIND OUT WHAT YOU CAN DO MORE WITHIN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD
THE PRINTING PRESS MADE SURE THAT EVERYBODY SAW IT
CHOIRS OF ANGELS
THAT'S WHERE IT ALL CAME ABOUT AND IT CAME ABOUT FROM A CHURCH THAT WAS TRYING TO SAVE A WORK OF ART
BECAUSE I REALIZED THAT THIS REPRESENTATION OF THE HUMAN DRAMA WAS ALWAYS ABOUT MEN AND
AND HE HAD BEEN LEFT WITH A COMMISSION TO PAINT 12 APOSTLES AGAINST A DECORATIVE BACKGROUND IN THE SISTINE CHAPEL
BUT GENIUS ROSE TO THE CHALLENGE
HE FOCUSED ON THE ACT OF CREATION
I'VE SHARED THIS INTERESTING STORY WITH MANY FAMILY MEMBERS AT MANY FAMILY GATHERINGS
FAMILIES NEED PROTECTED SPACES TOO
OF COURSE THE INTERNET HAS EVOLVED AND PROGRESSED QUITE A LOT SINCE THEN AND IT HAS MADE IT
MY FATHER IS A YOUNG AND AMBITIOUS MAN
THIS WAS MY IDENTITY TO THE WORLD AND THIS WAS MY STORY THE WAY THAT I WANTED TO TELL IT
THESE ARE STORIES AT THE HEART OF OUR IDENTITIES
THEY COULD BE AS SIMPLE AS SOME TIME SET ASIDE IN THE DAY FOR YOURSELF OR THEY COULD BE FAMILY
THEY COULD BE BOTH PHYSICAL AND VIRTUAL
AND IF I HADN'T CREATED THAT PROTECTED SPACE FOR MY PARENTS TO SHARE THEIR STORIES I DON'T THINK I WOULD HAVE EVER
NOW THIS IS A COUNTRY HE HAS LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF
WE CONSUME EACH OTHER'S PHOTOS LINKS AND LIKES
WE ROLL OUR EYES AT SOME OF THE EMBARRASSING STORIES THAT GET SHARED OVER AND OVER AND
SO MY FATHER WENT THERE AND HE BOUGHT A WHITE VOLKSWAGEN BEETLE
THAT CARS ARE MEANT TO BE DENTED AND THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST OF MANY DENTS HE WOULD EXPERIENCE IN HIS
THEY TOLD ME STORIES ABOUT THE WHITE VW BUG BUT ALSO STORIES ABOUT THE KOREAN WAR THEY
SO THERE IS SOME DANGER THAT WHEN I TELL YOU THAT ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE IS ONE OF THE GREATEST THREATS TO
AND UNLESS THINGS CHANGE BY 2050 RESISTANT INFECTIONS WILL KILL MORE
THE SAME STUDIES COULD BE DONE IN THE US FOR PATIENTS WITH MENINGITIS OR INFLUENZA
I BELIEVE WE ARE POISED FOR A REVOLUTION IN HOW WE DIAGNOSE AND TREAT INFECTIONS NOT JUST IN THE US BUT
I WANT YOU GUYS TO LOOK AROUND YOU LOOK AT THE STAGE LOOK AT WHAT'S IN FRONT OF YOU
WELL I THINK VR IS GOING TO EVOLVE IN WAYS THAT WE CAN'T ANTICIPATE
IN EFFECT ON THE INTERNET WE ALL SEE A DIFFERENT VERSION OF REALITY
AND I WANT HIM TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS AUGMENTED REALITY HE'S GROWING UP TO EXPERIENCE
AND THIS FEELING MADE ME PAUSE AND TAKE STOCK
IT'S VIRTUAL REALITY
THE STUFF THAT I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT
SO NETWORK EFFECTS EXPLAIN WHY SO FEW FIRMS DOMINATE THE INTERNET
WE KNOW THAT AS WE MOVE INTO A VR SATURATED WORLD THIS WILL BE PART OF THAT
SO IF WE WANT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT WE NEED TO WORK AT IT
I DON'T WANT HIM TO BE SOME KIND OF UNAWARE EXPLOITED PARTICIPANT IN A
NOW WITH VR WE'RE TASKED WITH A DESIGN CHALLENGE
THE ADVENT OF THE INTERNET WAS SUPPOSED TO BRING THIS DEMOCRATIZED
OR THEY ARE FOR SALE BUT ONLY ON MY TERMS
AND SO WHAT I WANT TO DO NOW IS EXTRACT THE LESSONS OF THE INTERNET EXPERIENCE OF THE PAST
AND MOST RECENTLY WE'VE ACTUALLY DEVELOPED OUR FIRST OCCULUS RIFT EXPERIENCE WITH A COMPANY
BUT AS I WAS PLANNING OUR FUTURE STRATEGIES AND HOW WE WOULD HELP DEVELOP THE VIRTUAL REALITY
I HAD THIS FEELING THAT IT WAS LIKE 1994 WHEN NETSCAPE THE FIRST COMMERCIAL WEB BROWSER
FREE HAS A PRICE
THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU WILL BE HAPPIER AS WELL
I'VE LOOKED FOR IT IN THE FORM OF MEN ON WHITE HORSES CARRYING ARMOUR AND THINGS LIKE THAT
BE IMPATIENT WITH YOURSELF AND DON'T SETTLE
EVERYONE'S RUSHING TO GET SOMEWHERE AND DO SOMETHING AND PUSHING OTHER PEOPLE OUT OF THE WAY
BUT I'M STILL THINKING PROBABLY A TRAPPED NERVE OR A CARPAL TUNNEL AT WORST
YOU'RE FIGHTING A BATTLE AGAINST YOUR BRAIN AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WIN
SO THERE IS A LOT OF TRADITIONS THAT GO ALONG WITH IT FOR THE DANCERS FOR THE AUDIENCE AND FOR THE CITY OF NEW
THAT'S ONE KIND OF BALLET
AND I WANT TO MAKE A TIME MACHINE
I WAS ALWAYS SENDING MESSAGES TO MY FUTURE SELF USING TAPE RECORDERS
AND THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE UNDOCUMENTED BECAUSE NUMBERS FOR THAT POPULATION ARE AT BEST COMPLEX ESTIMATES
A 2017 POLL BY UCLA OF LA COUNTY RESIDENTS FOUND THAT 30 PERCENT
SO MA WAS TRYING TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING TO ME ABOUT GRANDMA AND WHEN THEY GREW UP BUT I COULDN'T PAY ATTENTION TO HER BECAUSE I WAS
I'M A JOURNALIST AND FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS I'VE BEEN DOCUMENTING THE LIVES OF US CITIZENS WHO'VE LOST PEOPLE TO
THEY RALLIED BEHIND HIM
ARE YOU GOING TO SPRING OUT OF BED
SO WHAT IS THE SECRET
SO WHAT DO WE DO
SO YOU GO TO THE GYM YOU WORK OUT
THAT WORKOUT ALWAYS FEELS GOOD
SO WE BROUGHT STUDENTS INTO THE LAB WE HAD THEM FILL OUT A NUMBER OF SCALES AND THEN THEY CAME IN A WEEK LATER AND PLAYED THE GAME FOR AN
AND SO WE STARTED LOOKING AT WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF COOPERATIVE GAME PLAY
WE COME BACK TO THE FACT THAT THE ONLY POINT OF REFERENCE IS REALLY YOURSELF
AND STILL YOUNG PEOPLE'S CHOICES NOW REFLECT THAT OLD INFORMATION
SO IS THAT A PROBLEM
AND YOU COULD
NOW BUT WHICH SHOULD YOU INVEST IN
NOT THAT WE NEED MANY PILOTS REALLY
NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT BUT I GUESS WE HAVE PRODUCED FAR TOO MANY OF THESE IN THE LAST 20 YEARS ANYWAY
WE'RE ALREADY DOING THIS WITH MICE WE'RE ALREADY DOING THIS WITH BATS I THINK WE SHOULD START DOING IT WITH SPERM
WE'VE HAD OUR CURRENT SIZE BRAIN AROUND 200000 YEARS
IT'S IN MANY WAYS MORE COMPLEX AND EVOLVED
IT'S THIS SECRET LANGUAGE
IT JUST DOESN'T WORK
THEY FOUND THAT ALSO THESE SPERM WHALES CAN CRAM 1600 MICRO CLICKS
I LEARNED TO BE ALWAYS THERE
IT'S ABOUT WOMEN THEMSELVES
WE ARE MINORS UNTIL THE DAY WE DIE
ONE OF THEM IS WHEN I WAS IN JAIL
AND TAKE ACTION TO MAKE IT NOW
A FRIEND ONCE ASKED ME SHE SAID SO WHEN DO YOU THINK THIS WOMEN DRIVING WILL HAPPEN
I TOLD HER ONLY IF WOMEN STOP ASKING WHEN
SO FOR ME IT WASN'T ONLY ABOUT THESE ATTACKS I HAD TO FACE
TWO BOYS HIT ME TODAY IN SCHOOL
HE BROKE THE GOOD BAD NEWS IN MY FACE
BUT THERE IS NO LAW BANNING YOU FROM DRIVING
SHE TAUGHT US TO DANCE TO OUR OWN SHADOWS
WE GO DOWN DARK ALLEYS THEY GO DEEPER INTO THE SHADOWS FURTHER THAN I HAVE EVER BEEN BUT
IT SLOWS THE HEART BEAT DOWN
MY MAMA NEVER WHISPERED THE SHAME OF POVERTY IN OUR EARS
INTELLECTUALLY THERE IS PROBABLY NO REASON TO BUY A LOTTERY TICKET
WE USE THEM
WE ACTUALLY FEEL GOOD
IT'S THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PLANTATION MODEL WHERE AS WE CONSUMED RESOURCES WE TAKE IT DOWN TO
BUT IN THE MOMENT WE BUY THAT LOTTERY TICKET SOMETHING HAPPENS
BUT STEVE JOBS FOUND A WAY OF EMBEDDING LOVE AND EMOTION INTO EACH OF THE PRODUCTS
PEOPLE LOVE THEIR MOTOROLA PHONES
IN SOME WAYS THEY ARE SUPERIOR PIECES OF TECHNOLOGY
THE REASON WE FEEL GOOD IS BECAUSE OUR MIND CREATES A FUTURE MEMORY OF WHAT WE'RE DOING
WHEN THEY GO TO APPLY THEM THEY TEND NOT TO WORK AND THEY CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY
I'VE BEEN READING ALL THESE BOOKS ABOUT INNOVATION
BUT IT'S NOT A LINEAR PATH
IN FACT IT'S A CIRCUIT THAT GOES THROUGH OUR EMOTIONAL CENTERS
AS HUMAN BEINGS WE ARE EMOTIONAL BEINGS
IT'S CALLED THEY SAY THAT FISH
BUT I'VE MOVED ON
PART OF ME'S INTERMINABLE IT GOES ON AND ON AND ON AND ON AND ON AND
AND THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT THE POLICIES THAT YOU ATTACH TO THAT CONTENT
SO WHY DID I GO BACK
IT WAS PRETTY BAD
TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE BEING ILL MADE IT HARD FOR ME TO WRITE SONGS
IF YOU DON'T THINK THAT MAKES IT HARD FOR A DEAF PERSON TO FOLLOW A PROGRAM TRY WATCHING A TV
IT'S TIME TO RETUNE REFOCUS AND REMEMBER WHO CLOSED CAPTIONING WAS CREATED
TELEVISION BROADCASTS IN THE UNITED STATES BEGAN IN 1928
60 YEARS BEFORE WE HAD DESCRIPTIVE VIDEO SERVICE FOR BLIND PEOPLE
BUT THE ONLY WAY TO ASSURE HIGH QUALITY REALTIME CLOSED CAPTIONING IS TO HIRE AND TRAIN
THE VIRUS WAS STOPPED IN NIGERIA BY THESE FOUR STRATEGIES AND THE PEOPLE IMPLEMENTING THEM OBVIOUSLY
CAN WE EVER STOP EBOLA WHEN IT STARTS TO SPREAD LIKE THIS
SO WE DO KNOW HOW TO STOP EBOLA AND THESE STRATEGIES WORK LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
WHEN OUR RELATIVES DIE WE CAN'T TAKE CARE OF THEM AS OUR TRADITION DEMANDS
TO HELP THESE COUNTRIES WHICH WERE IN SO MUCH TROUBLE AND CONCERN AT THAT TIME
BUT WHAT WE SAW WAS SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT
EVEN THE SALAD HATERS THAT COME TO THE GROWHAUS TRY IT AND GO NUTS FOR IT
WHEN DOCTORS EXAMINED THEIR HYMENS THEY COULD ONLY FIND CLEAR SIGNS OF PENETRATION
THIS WAS NOTED OVER 100 YEARS AGO IN 1906 BY THE NORWEGIAN DOCTOR MARIE
BUT WE MUST TRY
THE MYTHS ABOUT THE HYMEN HAVE LIVED ON FOR CENTURIES BECAUSE THEY HAVE CULTURAL
IN OTHER WORDS HYMENS NATURALLY VARY A LOT IN LOOKS AND THAT IS WHAT MAKES
BUT IT MAY LOOK A BIT DIFFERENT FROM BEFORE
AND THE HYPOTHERMIA SETS IN
IT'LL ALWAYS BE PART OF US
ON THE BEACH
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BLACK THIS BLACK
I JUST WENT INTO THINKING ABOUT THIS DREAM AND WHY AND HOW
THERE WAS ACTION BEHIND THESE WORDS
AND WE'LL NEVER FORGET IT
I DIDN'T DO IT
AND THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT I AM AT THE PRIME OF MY LIFE TODAY
I DIDN'T GIVE UP
WHEN BONNIE THOUGHT THE BACK OF MY THROAT WAS SWELLING UP SHE BROUGHT THE MEDICAL TEAM OVER TO OUR
THE WHOLE THING I JUST THOUGHT IN MY HALLUCINATORY MOMENT THAT I HEARD THE WORD TRACHEOTOMY
ALL OF THAT'S GREAT AND I DON'T DENIGRATE IT
THAT'S ALWAYS THERE AND IT'S UNDENIABLE
BUT IT WAS DEEPER
IT SAYS YOU GO AHEAD
WE CAN TELL THE DISTANCE WE CAN TELL THAT WHEN THEY COLLIDED THEY MERGED TO FORM A NEW BLACK HOLE ABOUT
ANGER DESTROYS APATHY
YEAH BUT IT'S GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH NOT HELPING ANYONE IS SO MUCH MONUMENTALLY
I DIDN'T FIGHT ANY HARDER THAN JACE FOR SOME ARBITRARY REASON MY BODY RESPONDED BETTER TO CHEMOTHERAPY THAN HE DID
THE CANCER ENDED UP RETURNING IN MY LUNGS
UNHAPPINESS DEPRESSION UNEMPLOYMENT
MUCH TO MY DISMAY THIS WASN'T AN ISOLATED INCIDENT
EVERYONE IS GOING THROUGH THEIR OWN BATTLES
ANGER CAN MOTIVATE YOU
SOMETIMES LIFE PUTS YOU IN THESE SERENDIPITOUS SITUATIONS THAT CAN'T REALLY BE EXPLAINED
SAME CANCER SAME TREATMENT SAME PROBLEMS
THEY'VE GONE TO THE EDGE OF WHAT THEY COULD ENDURE AND THEY'VE RETURNED VICTORIOUSLY SO THAT MUST MEAN THAT THEY'RE FINISHED
THEY KEPT THE PRICES HIGH AND CHASED PATENT INFRINGERS
AND THERE WAS AN EXODUS OF DYERS TO GERMANY AND SWITZERLAND
ONE WAS EINSTEIN'S THEORY OF RELATIVITY THE OTHER WAS ARGUABLY EVEN MORE REVOLUTIONARY QUANTUM
BUT DESPITE HIGH HOPES THE LHC REVEALED A BARREN SUBATOMIC WILDERNESS POPULATED ONLY BY A LONELY
BUT UNLIKE THE HIGGS FIELD THIS NUMBER HAS NO KNOWN EXPLANATION
IT'S BEEN ESTIMATED IN FACT THAT THERE ARE 10 TO THE 500 DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF STRING THEORY
TWO NEW IDEAS WERE TURNING THE SUBJECT ON ITS HEAD
IF DARK ENERGY WERE ANYWHERE NEAR THIS STRONG THEN THE UNIVERSE WOULD HAVE BEEN TORN APART STARS AND GALAXIES COULD
THIS SUMMER THE LHC BEGAN ITS SECOND PHASE OF OPERATION WITH AN ENERGY ALMOST DOUBLE WHAT WE ACHIEVED IN THE FIRST RUN
WE CAN'T ACCESS THESE OTHER UNIVERSES SO THERE'S NO WAY OF KNOWING WHETHER THEY'RE THERE OR NOT
THE NEXT FEW YEARS MAY TELL US WHETHER WE'LL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF NATURE OR WHETHER
IF SO THEN WE CAN CONTINUE THIS LONG JOURNEY THAT BEGAN 100 YEARS AGO WITH ALBERT EINSTEIN TOWARDS AN EVER
SO IT'S ONLY A GOOD THING
THE STAKES NOW COULD NOT BE HIGHER
THE HOPE WAS THAT A COMPLETE COMBINATION OF EINSTEIN'S GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY WHICH IS THE THEORY OF THE
A HUNDRED YEARS ON WE NOW FIND OURSELVES AT ANOTHER TURNING POINT IN PHYSICS BUT WHAT'S AT STAKE NOW IS
BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY AN EVEN WORSE EXAMPLE OF THIS KIND OF FINE TUNING OF A DANGEROUS NUMBER AND THIS TIME IT COMES FROM THE OTHER
BUT WHEN WE LOOK AROUND US WE SEE WE LIVE IN A UNIVERSE FULL OF INTERESTING STUFF FULL OF STARS PLANETS TREES
THIS CONTRADICTION IS THE MOST PRESSING PROBLEM IN FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICS AND IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS WE MAY FIND OUT WHETHER
IT SHOULD EITHER BE OFF SO THAT IT HAS A ZERO VALUE EVERYWHERE IN SPACE OR IT SHOULD BE ON SO IT HAS AN
WHAT THEY'RE REALLY PLANNING TO DO IS TO BUILD A MACHINE THAT WILL STUDY THE HIGGS BOSON IN DETAIL AND COULD GIVE US SOME CLUES AS TO WHETHER THESE
WHAT IF WE CREATE A CULTURE OF SELFLESSNESS
SO WHEN A CITY ALSO STARTS WITH LEADERSHIP IT STARTS AT OUR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS IT STARTS WITH OUR BOSSES IT STARTS WITH
WE RECOGNIZED THAT THERE IS AN ISSUE DOWNTOWN ON MARTIN LUTHER KING BOULEVARD ON ONE SIDE
AND IT TURNS OUT THAT DIFFERENT THINGS CRYSTALLIZE OUT AT DIFFERENT STAGES
ANTOINE DE SAINT EXUPERY ONCE SAID IF YOU WANT TO BUILD A FLOTILLA OF SHIPS YOU DON'T SIT AROUND TALKING ABOUT CARPENTRY
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE SEAWATER GREENHOUSE PRODUCES
AND THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT
AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO SO LET'S BE POSITIVE AND LET'S MAKE PROGRESS WITH WHAT COULD BE THE MOST EXCITING PERIOD OF INNOVATION WE'VE
CSP PRODUCES A LOT OF WASTE HEAT
AND THERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF PROJECTS THAT HAVE DELIBERATELY TRIED TO MIMIC ECOSYSTEMS
AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT NATURE OFTEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT AS BEING ALL ABOUT COMPETITION
I USED TO SAY I OWN A GENERAL CONSTRUCTION COMPANY
THAT'S HOW I DEAL WITH ALL THE NEGATIVE IN MY LIFE
I'M 25 YEARS OUT THERE AS A GENERAL CONTRACTOR
I'M NOW 49 YEARS OLD
WHAT'S A PANIC ATTACK
YOU KNOW WHAT
I LIVED A VERY COLOURFUL LIFE
IT'S NOT SOMETHING I WAS VERY HAPPY ABOUT
AND I HAVE THESE PALPITATIONS THAT ARE SHOWING UP
I HOPE YOU WILL GO OUT AND MAKE PERSONAL HEALTH HAPPEN FOR YOURSELVES AND FOR EVERYONE
TODAY I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU MY BIRMINGHAM STORY
WHY DID YOU LEAVE ALL THESE BEHIND
VERY RECENTLY A WOMAN WALKED UP TO ME FRANTIC
AS I MOTIONED IN THE DIRECTION I THOUGHT SHE SHOULD GO SAYING THERE ARE NO STORES ON THIS SIDE OF THE STREET SO YOUR
WHO'S DISABLED NOW
ONCE YOU GET IN YOU'RE HOOKED
BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT MOST OF US CAN'T DO IT AND THE ONES THAT CAN AFFORD TO DO IT IT'S COMPLICATED
WHAT WE NOW HAVE ARE THE BUILDING BLOCKS TO A VERY EXCITING FUTURE WHEN IT COMES TO ARTS AND CULTURE
NONE OF THIS BELONGS TO GOOGLE
AND THE WAY I DID IT WAS I REALIZED ONE DAY THAT SHE LOVES GOLD
IF WE KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT THE POLAR VORTEX WHY ARE THE WEATHER MEASUREMENTS SO OFF
WE REALLY DON'T GIVE THEM THE CHANCE
EVERYBODY USED THEM
THE COMPANY WAS BRILLIANT
WE HAVE NESTL CREATING NESPRESSO WE HAVE LEGO GOING INTO ANIMATED FILMS
BUT WE DON'T ONLY SEE THIS IN COMPANIES
AND WE TAKE THAT INFORMATION AND PUT IT BACK INTO THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE
AND WHO WINS BY THIS
AND ALL OF THESE DRUGS WERE MOVED FORWARD BASED ON POSITIVE RESULTS IN MOUSE MODELS
MY PANAMANIAN READ FOR EXAMPLE CAME THROUGH A CONVERSATION I HAD WITH THE PANAMA CANAL ON TWITTER
BUT IT CAN ALSO BE REALLY ENLIGHTENING
THEN IT WAS FRIENDS OF FRIENDS
AND WHEN I THOUGHT ABOUT IT IT SEEMED LIKE A REAL SHAME
I HOPE IT'S A STORY I'M READING FOR MANY YEARS TO COME
BUT MY BOOKSHELVES TOLD A RATHER DIFFERENT STORY
ALTHOUGH THE PROPORTION OF TRANSLATED BOOKS PUBLISHED IN MANY OTHER COUNTRIES IS A LOT HIGHER
SO FOR EXAMPLE ALTHOUGH WELL OVER 100 BOOKS ARE TRANSLATED FROM FRENCH AND PUBLISHED IN THE UK EACH
I COULDN'T TELL YOU HOW TO SOURCE A STORY FROM SWAZILAND
THEY HAVE TO BASICALLY MAKE SUGGESTIONS RECOMMENDATIONS AND OFFER
FOR EXAMPLE TELLING THEM THIS IS CALLED A GRAPEFRUIT WHATEVER YOU'RE HOLDING RIGHT NOW
AND THAT'S CALLED AN APPLE ET CETERA
LET'S JUST THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH PROTEIN IS IN A SINGLE CELL
SO INSTEAD OF EXCLUSIVELY SYNTHESIZING PROTEINS IN THE CELL BODY WHAT THEY'VE DONE IS TO
SO THE PROBE WILL BIND SPECIFICALLY
IF YOU WALK AROUND THE CITY OF OXFORD WHERE WE ARE TODAY AND HAVE A LOOK AT THE BRICKWORK WHICH I'VE ENJOYED DOING IN THE LAST COUPLE OF
THEY THINK BIG
THIS LITTLE BAG IS ABLE TO CONDUCT ITSELF IN A WAY THAT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS LIVING
BUT IMAGINE WHAT THE PROPERTIES OF THIS LIMESTONE BLOCK MIGHT BE IF THE
THEY CAN EXPECT TO HAVE A LOT OF FORMS AND FUNCTIONS WITHIN THE PRACTICE OF ARCHITECTURE
NOW WE HAVE AN ARCHITECTURE THAT CONNECTS A CITY TO THE NATURAL WORLD IN A VERY DIRECT AND
YOU HAVE TO JUST CHOOSE YOUR SPECIES
BUT GRADUALLY AS THE BUILDINGS ARE REPAIRED WE WILL SEE THE ACCRETION OF A LIMESTONE REEF BENEATH THE
IT IS ABLE TO MOVE AROUND ITS ENVIRONMENT
BUT THEY DON'T EXIST
SO I'M HAVING TO MAKE THEM
I'M WORKING WITH ARCHITECT NEIL SPILLER AT THE BARTLETT SCHOOL OF ARCHITECTURE AND WE'RE COLLABORATING WITH INTERNATIONAL SCIENTISTS
THE AIR AT THE SOUTH POLE DRIES EVERYTHING
I WAS IN POLY SPEAK TOASTY
ANOTHER IS A DESERT BECAUSE WATER VAPOR MOISTURE ABSORBS MICROWAVE LIGHT
IT DESICCATES YOUR SKIN TURNING IT PAPERY AND FRAGILE SO THAT IT TEARS WHEN YOU REACH IN A POCKET AND THEN
THE FIRST DIRECT RAYS SHOOK MY MIND
I MEAN WE'VE WATCHED IT HAPPEN
MY DAILY COMMUTE A ONE KILOMETER TRUDGE THROUGH THE ICY BLACKNESS FROM STATION TO TELESCOPE
THEY WERE LOOKING BACK IN TIME 1
FROM THE FARTHEST SIDE MODERN HUMANS DON'T EXIST THE EARTH AS SEEN HAS NOT EVOLVED US
THEY LET US SEE THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF EXISTENCE LAID BARE BEFORE OUR EYES
WELL TAKE 0
KEEP IN MIND THE EXAM IS WEDNESDAY NIGHT OK
IT WAS A MESS ERASER MARKS EVERYWHERE STUFF SCRATCHED OUT BUT 5
THIS IS A BIG QUESTION NOW TO HELP US UNDERSTAND WHY THEY SHOULD BE IN THE CITY
WE HAVE ALSO SOME IMAGES OF HONEY FROM BROOKLYN
THE BEES JUST AREN'T AROUND ANYMORE
AGAIN A BIT COUNTERINTUITIVE
AND COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER IS NOT THE ONLY THING AFFECTING HONEYBEES
A BEE ISN'T GOING TO STING YOU IF YOU SEE IT
WHY DON'T WE THINK ABOUT HONEYBEES IN THAT SAME TYPE OF WAY
WE EXERCISE WE EAT HEALTHY WE TAKE VITAMINS
PARIS HAS BEEN A TERRIFIC MODEL FOR URBAN BEEKEEPING
WHAT CAN WE DO HERE
I GOT MY PH
WHY ARE BEES DOING BETTER IN THE CITY
THIS IS CALLED COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER AND IT'S BIZARRE
WE HAVE HUGE GRAND CHALLENGES THESE DAYS OF HABITAT LOSS
I UNDERSTAND THAT
WHEN DOCTORS EXAMINED THEIR HYMENS THEY COULD ONLY FIND CLEAR SIGNS OF PENETRATION
IN OTHER WORDS HYMENS NATURALLY VARY A LOT IN LOOKS AND THAT IS WHAT MAKES
BUT THAT MAKES SENSE RIGHT
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE A VIRGIN OR NOT
THE MYTHS ABOUT THE HYMEN HAVE LIVED ON FOR CENTURIES BECAUSE THEY HAVE CULTURAL
THAT COULD BE PLASTIC SURGERY KNOWN AS REVIRGINATION IT COULD BE VIALS OF BLOOD POURED
IN NORWEGIAN IT IS EVEN CALLED THE VIRGIN MEMBRANE AND WITH THIS WE PICTURE
AND PEOPLE STILL WONDER WHY THERE ARE BOYS ROTTING THEY GO AWAY IN HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAYS THEY ARE AFRAID OF
AND I SWALLOWED THEIR INSULTS ALONG WITH THEIR SLURS
CALLED ME BY A NAME I DID NOT RECOGNIZE SAID LESBIAN BUT I WAS MORE BOY THAN GIRL MORE KEN THAN
IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HATING MY BODY I JUST LOVE IT ENOUGH TO LET IT GO I TREAT IT LIKE A HOUSE AND WHEN YOUR
IT TURNED OUT THAT ALL WE NEED TO DO IS BASICALLY TO LET THE BRAIN FORM A MEMORY AND THEN THE BRAIN WILL
NOW ONE DUDE IN LAB WAS EVEN ABLE TO REACTIVATE MEMORIES OF FEMALE MICE IN MALE MICE WHICH RUMOR HAS IT IS A PLEASURABLE
SO WHAT IF WE COULD START OFF BY GOING INTO THE BRAIN AND JUST FINDING A SINGLE MEMORY TO BEGIN WITH
AS SIMPLE AS THAT
SO WHENEVER A MEMORY IS BEING FORMED ANY ACTIVE CELLS FOR THAT MEMORY WILL ALSO HAVE THIS
NOW I EVEN SEE A WORLD WHERE EDITING MEMORIES IS SOMETHING OF A REALITY BECAUSE WE'RE LIVING IN A TIME WHERE IT'S POSSIBLE TO PLUCK QUESTIONS FROM
WE'RE JUST TRYING TO CONNECT THE TWO
COULD WE POSSIBLY EVEN TURN IT INTO A FALSE MEMORY
SO FAR WHAT WE'VE TOLD YOU IS BASICALLY WE CAN CONTROL THIS PLAY BUTTON OF THE CLIP SO THAT WE CAN PLAY THIS VIDEO
BUT MEMORY IS NOT
COULD WE JUMP START THAT MEMORY BACK TO LIFE MAYBE EVEN PLAY WITH THE CONTENTS OF THAT MEMORY
DO I SAY HI
FIRST YOU FIND AND LABEL A MEMORY IN THE BRAIN AND THEN YOU ACTIVATE IT WITH A
IT DOES MAKE SENSE THIS IS A LOGICAL SNACK
THE SCIENTIFIC TERM THE MEDICAL TERM FOR PROTEIN DEFICIENCY IS KWASHIORKOR YOU
AND THEY SAY WELL HOW DO YOU DO THAT
I'VE SEEN PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES LIKE SERENA AND VENUS WILLIAMS AND THE 1 RUNNING BACK IN THE NFL
DON'T GO THERE GUYS
IT'S A MINERAL
LET'S PICK ON OLIVE OIL FOR A SECOND
MOST AMERICANS ARE CONSUMING 5 TO 15 GRAMS OF FIBER A DAY
AND I SAID LISTEN AS FAR AS PROTEIN'S CONCERNED IT'S A BOOGIE MAN DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT
MOST FISH HAS MORE CHOLESTEROL THAN RED MEAT OR CHICKEN SALMON WHICH IS CONSIDERED THE HEALTHIEST
CALCIUM COMES FROM THE GROUND
NOW THESE GUYS KNEW THE PROCESSED AND REFINED FOODS WERE NOT HEALTHY
SO IF YOU WANT TO SLAY THAT ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION DRAGON AND ALLOW YOUR PUFF THE MAGIC DRAGON
AND THAT'S PROBLEMATIC
THEY KNEW ABOUT THE SUGAR AND THE POP AND THE FRIED CHIPS AND THE CANDY BARS
NOT ONE IOTA
SO WE WOULD TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF LEMON JUICE AVOCADO SOME SPICES AND DRIVE IT IN
I'VE SEEN MEDIA MOGULS LIKE OPRAH AND ELLEN THAT ARE NOW PUSHING PLANTS
I'VE SEEN CEO'S LIKE JOHN MACKEY AND BIZ STONE OF TWITTER AND BILL FORD OF
IT'S NOT COWCIUM
I'M DOING IT ON PURPOSE
WE'RE THE ONLY ONES THAT HAVE THE UNMITIGATED AUDACITY TO GO THERE ALRIGHT
YOU START EATING PLANT BASED AND SUDDENLY IT GOES UP TO 30 TO 70 GRAMS OF FIBER AND NOW YOU'RE REGULAR AS A
I'M WEARING MY SHIRT INSIDE OUT
SO AS FIREFIGHTERS WE HAVE TO USE ALL OF OUR WIT AND WE HAVE TO OUTWIT OUTSMART IT AND
AND WHAT WE ARE CURRENTLY DOING WITH PILLS AND PROCEDURES AND MORE LEGISLATION AND MORE DOCTORS
THAT ARE GOING PLANT BASED
WHAT ABOUT CALCIUM
AND SO THIS IS WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO
AND SO I HEREBY DECLARE THAT YOU ARE ALL IN AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP
WHAT'S THE GOAL
IT DOESN'T COST MUCH TO IMPLEMENT THEM
THAT'S WHAT GENERATES REVENUE
WE ARE BECOMING AWARE OF THIS AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT NO NEUTRAL DESIGN
WE TEND TO STICK TO A PREDETERMINED POSITION AND THAT MEANS THAT DEFAULT
TO MAKE US CLICK
AND WHAT ABOUT ETHICAL ISSUES
MOST OF THESE APPLICATIONS ARE CHEAP
THE APPEAL IS CLEAR
PERHAPS YOU DO
THIS IS BECOMING EVEN MORE INTERESTING TODAY
PROBABLY YOU ARE
DEAR MISS FASTDRIVER WE WOULD LIKE TO REMIND YOU TO PAY YOUR FINE FOR EXCESS SPEED
MORE AND MORE COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD ARE GETTING VERY INTERESTED IN SUCH AN APPROACH
IT IS POTENTIALLY DISRUPTIVE FOR OUR OWN UNDERSTANDING OF OUR OWN BEING BUT ALSO FOR OUR UNDERSTANDING OF
IF NOT I HAVE ANOTHER ILLUSTRATION FOR YOU
PSYCHOLOGY BUT ALSO BEHAVIOURAL ECONOMICS AND SOME ASPECTS FROM
YOU CHOOSE TO BECOME ONE
TO SEE IF IT WAS STILL DRY FROM THE INSIDE
5 METERS AND 5 METERS HIGH BECAME VISIBLE
AND ACTUALLY WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT IT'S NOT THAT CRAZY AFTER ALL
THAT WAS ACTUALLY ONE OF OUR LUCKIEST THINGS DURING THE PROCESS BECAUSE AS SOON AS THE TENTS ARRIVED A HUGE TRUCK
WHERE EVERYTHING IS MADE OUT OF CARDBOARD
CARDBOARD IS LIGHT WEIGHT IT'S FOLDABLE AND IT'S VERY EASY TO RECYCLE
AND I WENT WITH HIM TO THE EVENT IN ROTTERDAM
AND THERE I SPOKE TO A GUY THAT WAS DOING SOMETHING WITH SUSTAINABLE CARDBOARD BEACH HOUSES
WE SHOULD MAKE A TENT OUT OF CARDBOARD
AND I'M ONE OF THESE MANAGERS
ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU TELL THEM THEY HAVE TO STOP DOING THAT TO DO SOMETHING ELSE
AND MANAGERS ARE BASICALLY PEOPLE WHOSE JOB IT IS TO INTERRUPT PEOPLE
SO IF YOU'RE A MANAGER START ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO USE MORE THINGS LIKE I
IF YOU'RE INTERRUPTED AND WOKEN UP YOU HAVE TO START AGAIN
I HOPE THAT SOME OF THESE IDEAS WERE AT LEAST PROVOCATIVE ENOUGH FOR MANAGERS AND BOSSES AND BUSINESS
SO JUST THE AFTERNOON ONE THURSDAY
IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY
THAT'S KIND OF BAD
GIVING SOMEONE FOUR HOURS OF UNINTERRUPTED TIME IS THE BEST GIFT YOU CAN GIVE ANYBODY AT WORK
COMPANIES OFTEN THINK OF A ONE HOUR MEETING AS A ONE HOUR MEETING BUT THAT'S NOT TRUE UNLESS THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON
SOME OF YOU MAY WORK AT PLACES WHERE YOU CAN'T GET TO CERTAIN SITES
THEY'RE FOR INTERRUPTING PEOPLE
WHICH IS RIDICULOUS BUT THAT'S ONE OF THE EXCUSES THAT MANAGERS GIVE
ONE IS KIND OF A PLACE OR A LOCATION OR A ROOM
I'VE BEEN ASKING PEOPLE THIS QUESTION FOR ABOUT 10 YEARS WHERE DO YOU GO WHEN YOU REALLY NEED TO GET SOMETHING DONE
WHY IS THAT HAPPENING
RED HAIR AND WHITE SKIN
AND I'M NOT GOING TO REST UNTIL ANYONE WHO HAS SCHIZOPHRENIA
THE CLOWN IS ACTUALLY IN THE AUDIENCE TODAY AND YOU WOULD NEVER KNOW
WE NEED TO CHANGE THE FACE OF SCHIZOPHRENIA BECAUSE THE REPRESENTATION CURRENTLY IS
I WOULD ALSO HALLUCINATE SPIDERS SOMETIMES LITTLE SPIDERS
BUT YOU WOULD NEVER KNOW THAT I'M HALLUCINATING
BUT THERE'S A PROBLEM
I WAS ACTUALLY AMAZED
REDIFER WHERE FRIENDS WERE PASSING BY AND SEEING ME PUT INTO A POLICE CAR
THERE IS NO NONPROFIT IN THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES FOCUSED ON THAT
I COMMEND HER FOR HER BRAVERY
AND I AM CONFIDENT THAT I WOULD NOT BE HERE TODAY IF I DIDN'T GET THE PROPER MEDICAL HELP
I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE DIAGNOSIS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA
THIS CAN'T BE ON OUR MEDICAL HISTORY
I TALKED TO THE DOCTORS THEY SAID OK LET'S FIX THE MEDS YOU CAN STAY HERE OVERNIGHT
HOWEVER WHEN IT MOVED ITS LEGS THE CREAKING OF THE LEGS SOUNDED LIKE YOUNG CHILDREN LAUGHING
TODAY I'M GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT MY STORY WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA
BUT IT BECAME VERY PREVALENT IN MY JUNIOR YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL AND THEN IT JUST SNOWBALLED
BECAUSE MY LIFE HAD BECOME A WAKING NIGHTMARE
SO I ADMITTED MYSELF INTO THE EMERGENCY ROOM
THE QUESTIONS BEGAN TO FEEL INTERROGATIVE
I NEVER NEEDED BIOLOGY TO FORM FAMILY ANYWAY
JOHN'S WHICH IS ALL BOYS
I WOULD SEND OUT MY BOOKS
CELEBRATE YOUR OWN STYLE
NOW I USED TO WORK THE WEEKENDS AT THE HOLE IN THE WALL OFF SEASON PROGRAMMING TO MAKE SOME EXTRA MONEY AS I WAS TRYING TO GET MY FEET OFF
HE WANTED ME TO GO TO A PRIVATE SCHOOL AND HE GAVE ME AN OPTION
AND I LOVED THAT THOUGHT OF BEING ABLE TO SHARE MY IDEAS THROUGH THE PRINTED PAGE
DO YOU HAVE A JOB YET
I SET UP A STUDIO AND I TRIED TO GET PUBLISHED
I GRADUATED FROM RISD
BUT I KNOW IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
AND I RECEIVED AN EMAIL FROM AN EDITOR AT RANDOM HOUSE WITH A SUBJECT LINE NICE WORK
I WOULD SEND OUT HUNDREDS OF POSTCARDS TO EDITORS AND ART DIRECTORS BUT THEY WOULD GO UNANSWERED
DON'T DRAW THE WAY YOU'RE BEING TOLD TO DRAW
AND THEN SOMETHING HAPPENED THAT CHANGED MY LIFE
YOU CAN GO TO HOLY NAME WHICH IS COED OR ST
THEY EACH SMOKED TWO PACKS A DAY EACH NONFILTERED AND BY THE TIME I WAS SIX I COULD ORDER A SOUTHERN COMFORT
SO I LOVED WRITING SO MUCH THAT I'D COME HOME FROM SCHOOL AND I WOULD TAKE OUT PIECES OF PAPER AND I WOULD STAPLE THEM
AND MY GRANDFATHER HE WAS A WISE MAN AND HE SAW THAT AS A PROBLEM BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT WAS LIKE THE ONE THING I
AND I THOUGHT OH NO
THAT'S WHAT EXPRESSION IS
WE APPLAUD THE WELL MANNERED BOX
AND I THINK OUR ARCHITECTURE IS A CONFRONTATION WITH OUR OWN SENSES
WE WOULD NOT KNOW WHICH WAY WE WERE GOING AND WHY WE ARE GOING WHERE WE'RE GOING
I CAME FROM THE BRONX
IF YOU THINK OF THE GREAT BUILDINGS OF THE CATHEDRALS OF THE TEMPLES OF THE PYRAMIDS OF PAGODAS OF CITIES
THERE IS SO MANY INTERESTS
AND YET I BELIEVE IT IS THE EXPRESSION EXPRESSION OF THE CITY EXPRESSION OF OUR OWN SPACE THAT GIVES
AND ARCHITECTURE IS SO CLOSELY INTERTWINED WITH IT BECAUSE WE ARE BORN SOMEWHERE AND WE DIE SOMEWHERE
AND YET AT THE END IT'S SO HARD TO CHANGE A WALL
AND OF COURSE WE ARE ALL ABOUT THE STRUGGLE OF EMOTIONS
SO THE REALITY OF ARCHITECTURE IS VISCERAL
IT'S AN ART OF COMMUNICATION
THERE IS SO MANY PARTIES TO THIS PROJECT
AND WE LIVE IN A WORLD WHICH IS CONNECTING US MORE AND MORE
EVEN THE MIND IS EMOTIONAL
WE CAN CREATE INCREDIBLE THINGS
THERE IS SO MANY INTERESTS
YOU HAVE TO FIGHT FOR WHAT YOU BELIEVE
AND IT'S LIKE ESPRESSO COFFEE YOU KNOW YOU TAKE THE ESSENCE OF THE COFFEE
AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY WHAT ARCHITECTURE IS BASED ON
IT'S BASED ON WONDER
AND I THINK THAT IS INDEED WHAT ARCHITECTURE IS
IT'S SUCH A COMPLEX PROJECT
THEY ARE ALL SITTING THERE
WE GREW UP IN IOWA
WE PROVIDED EDUCATION
WE WILL HELP YOU DO THAT
I CANNOT AND I WILL NOT PULL UP THE LADDER BEHIND ME
AND WE ARGUED WITH THE WORLD BANK
7 CENTS A KILOWATT HOUR
THEIR ASPIRATIONS WENT UP
THAT'S A NEGATIVE INTEREST RATE BOND
I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL I WENT TO COLLEGE
IT'S A PREFERENTIAL OPTION FOR THE POOR
AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE DID
AND THEY SAID WELL THAT'S A NICE THOUGHT BUT IT'S JUST NOT COST EFFECTIVE
AND THEN A CRAZY THING HAPPENED
IT DEPENDS ON THE QUALITY OF THE IDEAS
YOU'VE ALL HEARD THAT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WE WILL MAKE THE INTRODUCTIONS
IT CAN'T BE DONE
JEFF SKOLL IS HERE
I RECOGNIZED THEM
LOWEST BID 25 CENTS A KILOWATT HOUR FOR ZAMBIA
YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO DROP ME
I'M PRESIDENT OF THE WORLD BANK
THEY UNDERSTOOD WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO LIVE IN A PLACE LIKE NEW YORK CITY IN THE 1950S
AND SO WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT MEETING THESE ASPIRATIONS
ARE THERE NEW WAYS OF THINKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN RISE TO MEET THESE ASPIRATIONS
WE WILL EVEN PROVIDE FINANCING
BECAUSE IF WE DON'T I'M EXTREMELY WORRIED
EVERYWHERE ASPIRATIONS ARE GOING UP
AND I SAID OK THAT'S IT RIGHT
OR BETTER YET COME NEAR WHERE I LIVE ON EL CAJON BLV
YOU KNOW FIFTEEN MILES
THATS NOT AN ACCURATE DESCRIPTION EITHER
I BELIEVE THAT WHAT WE MAP CHANGES THE LIFE WE LEAD
AND I SAID I DON'T KNOW LIKE SIX HOURS
WHY WOULD I WANT TO JUMP OVER ALL THESE HURDLES AND HAVE THAT BE THE END
SO I HAD ONE LEARNING COMMUNITY IN HIGH SCHOOL THEN I WENT TO ANOTHER FOR COLLEGE AND THEN I WENT TO ANOTHER WHEN I
WE'RE GOING TO SUE YOUR PANTS OFF
THEY LITERALLY PUT NOOSES ON THEMSELVES AND THEN THEY WENT OFF TO THEIR JOBS WHATEVER THEY WERE
IT'S TRUE THAT I HAD TEACHERS THAT DIDN'T GIVE UP ON ME AND I WAS VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE THOSE TEACHERS BECAUSE I OFTEN GAVE
AND THAT'S WHEN LEARNING REALLY BEGAN FOR ME
HERE'S ZE TALKING ABOUT LAS VEGAS
TODAY'S QUESTION IS WHY
IT WAS SPOTTY IT WAS INCONSISTENT THERE WAS A LOT I DIDN'T KNOW
IT'S ABOUT CARTOGRAPHY
WHAT IS THE PROCESS OF CARTOGRAPHY
THE WAY THAT WE CHOOSE TO SORT OF OUR PERSONAL CARTOGRAPHIC ENTERPRISE ALSO SHAPES THE
WE MADE AGLOE NEW YORK UP
IT IS A FAKE PLACE
IT'S A PAPER TOWN
THEY ALL HAVE MORE THAN HALF A MILLION VIEWS ON YOUTUBE
EVEN MORE SO ONE OF MY INTERNET FRIENDS WAS ACTUALLY A MEDICAL RESEARCHER AND HE CONNECTED ME WITH SOME OF
I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND THAT THE BEST WAY TO LEARN IS THROUGH PLAY AND THAT MAKES VIDEO GAMES THE BEST
THROUGHOUT THE NEXT TWO YEARS I SLOWLY BEGAN TO RECOVER
CHALLENGE IS ACTUALLY A VERY UNIQUE TRAIT FOUND IN VIDEO GAMES
AND TODAY WITH ONLY THREE HOURS OF TIME I ACCOMPLISHED A MAJOR GOAL IN MY LIFE AND I
A RESEARCH STUDY THAT I'M CONDUCTING RIGHT NOW SHOWS EVIDENCE THAT THE AMOUNT OF BRAIN PROCESSING POWER THAT IT TAKES TO
WITH HIS RECOMMENDATIONS I MET WITH DOCTORS WHO ULTIMATELY GAVE ME CRITICAL ADVICE THAT KEPT ME ALIVE
VIDEO GAMES DEFINE OUR WORLD
WELL I'M A GAMER AND I PLAY AROUND THREE HOURS OF LEAGUE OF LEGENDS EVERY DAY
GIVING THEM HOPE AND GIVING THEM INSPIRATION
THROUGH MY STUDIES I FOUND THAT VIDEO GAMES ARE ACTUALLY AMAZING TOOLS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL
AND THAT'S RIGHT
WITH THE RECENT EXPANSION OF VIRTUAL REALITY TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES CEO'S ARE ABLE TO HAVE IN PERSON
A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THIS IS GAME CALLED DRAGON BOX THAT TEACHES ALGEBRA THROUGH PLAY
HOWEVER I COULDN'T HELP BUT LOOK BACK AND THINK TO MYSELF
THESE GAMES LIKE LEAGUE OF LEGENDS' WERE NOT DESIGNED TO HELP ME
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THEY ARE
HOWEVER THEY WOULD CHECK UP ON ME
NOT BECAUSE I WAS IN PAIN OR BECAUSE TREATMENT WAS DIFFICULT
I'D PEOPLE WHO LATER TOLD ME THAT THEY THOUGHT I WAS DEAD
WE ALL LIVED WITH THE CONSTANT FEAR THAT I COULD DIE AT ANY MOMENT
VIDEO GAMES ARE NOT JUST TOYS FOR KIDS AND WE MUST TREAT THEM WITH A PRACTICAL PERSPECTIVE
EVERYBODY WAS HAPPY
WHAT DO YOU MEAN EPIDEMIC
AND SOME OF THEM MANY OF THEM ACTUALLY HAD WATER THAT CAME INTO MORE THAN ONE ROOM
WHO IS INFECTING OTHER PEOPLE
AND THERE'S SPECIAL WORKERS FOR DOING THAT
BECAUSE HE CAN'T SEE HIM
45 CALIBER HANDGUN
HE SAYS I CAN'T WEAR THIS STUFF
IT'S NOT THIS RIGHT
ACCURACY WE KNOW FROM HISTORICAL RECORDS THAT SLINGERS
AND ACROMEGALY HAS A VERY DISTINCT SET OF SIDE EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH IT PRINCIPALLY HAVING
DAVID ONLY HAS ONE STICK
AND THROUGHOUT HISTORY MANY OF THE MOST FAMOUS GIANTS HAVE ALL HAD ACROMEGALY
YOU'VE GOT TO BE CRAZY
THEY'RE A SEAFARING PEOPLE
THERE'S NO WAY THEY THINK THEY CAN TAKE HIM
YOU CAN'T GO AS YOU ARE
HOW DO PARENTS USE KIDS' WEAR
I REALLY BELIEVE THAT EVERYONE HAS SOMETHING TO LEARN FROM THE B BOY PROCESS THIS BREAKIN' MENTALITY
THEY ALSO ASSUMED THAT SHE WAS MEANT TO BE HELD OR PLACED LYING DOWN BECAUSE HER TINY FEET DON'T ALLOW HER TO
THEY EXPERIENCE LESS SEXISM
I'VE TAKEN TO CALLING THIS THE WILLENDORF EFFECT AND ONCE AGAIN WE SEE IT REINFORCED IN MANY ASPECTS OF HER
IN MY EFFORTS TO EXPLAIN THIS TO OTHERS ONE CONVERSATION LED TO THE VENUS OF WILLENDORF
BUT BEFORE I COULD LAND ON THE DESIRED WORD I FELT A FIRM TAP ON MY SHOULDER AND A STERN GAZE
WE SEE IT IN ADVERTISEMENTS
I ALSO ASKED HETEROSEXUAL MEN TO IMAGINE A WOMAN THAT THEY'RE PARTNERED WITH IS PREGNANT AND THEN ASKED WOMEN TO
SO THE PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY AREN'T EVEN ABLE TO SAY GOODBYE
THE HOSPITAL PUT OUT A PRESS RELEASE ABOUT MY CASE WHICH LED TO MORE CONNECTIONS
WE'RE BOTH ABOUT THE SAME AGE
MARBURG EBOLA SARS THEY'RE NOT GOING AWAY NO MATTER HOW SCARED THEY MAKE US
THE AFRICAN DISEASE HAD COME TO US
YET I SEE HER AS A FRIEND
HE HAD LIVED IN AFRICA FOR A WHILE
MY OUTBREAK BEGAN AND ENDED WITH ME
THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT FOR SCIENCE BECAUSE NOW WE HAVE A NATURAL
HE WAS NOW LEADING A STUDY TO TRY AND FIND A VACCINE FOR MARBURG AND EBOLA
IN FACT JUST THIS WEEK THERE WAS ANNOUNCEMENTS ABOUT CASES OF BUBONIC PLAGUE IN COLORADO
WE NEED TO PRACTICE COMPASSION
WELL THIS WEB OF SHARED INTERESTS HAVE ALLOWED PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD TO COME TOGETHER AROUND
WHILE THEY WERE THERE THEY TOURED AN ORPHANAGE AND ASTRID FELT A STRONG CONNECTION TO THE CHILDREN
SO WHY DO I SAY ASTRID MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR A SCIENTIFIC BREAKTHROUGH
AND SOME OF THEM ARE GOING TO BE AMERICANS
AND WHILE IT'S NOT OUR CUSTOM IN THESE COMMUNITIES THE FAMILIES PREPARE THE BODIES FOR DEATH
ASTRID'S STORY IS ONE OF CONNECTIONS
YOU JUST PUT THEM IN QUARANTINE AND OFFER SUPPORTIVE CARE
IT GOES UNDERGROUND UNTIL IT POPS UP AGAIN MYSTERIOUSLY TO TERRORIZE THE NEXT
EBOLA WAS JUST A DRY RUN
AND IT'S ALL AROUND
QUITE TO THE CONTRARY I WAS A TOMBOY
MORE THAN A TOMBOY I WAS A TROUBLE MAKER
SO HOW WE FEEL WE APPEAR TO OTHERS IS ENOURMOUSLY IMPORTANT TO OUR LIVES
PERHAPS ANOTHER STORY WILL HELP DO THAT AS WELL
WHEN I WAS ASKED TO DESCRIBE MYSELF FOR THIS TALK I CHOSE THREE WORDS
LARGELY BECAUSE I THINK I CONSIDERED IT AND I WAS WORRIED THAT OTHER PEOPLE MIGHT THINK IT A FRIVOLOUS WAY TO
THE GOOD NEWS FOR ME WAS THAT THIS EXPERIENCE FORCED ME TO
AND IF YOU LOOK AROUND THIS AUDIENCE IT'S PROBABLY THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IN THIS AUDIENCE
YOU MIGHT NOT BELIEVE IT BUT EVEN OUR OWN BODIES ARE RADIOACTIVE ENOUGH TO DISTURB THIS EXPERIMENT
THOSE CHARACTERIZE THE COMPUTATIONAL PROPERTIES OF THIS NETWORK
BIRD IS ONLY FOUR LETTERS RIGHT
IT'S ALL IN ENGLISH AND I'M GOING
I SAID YOU MAKE YOUR OWN GROUPS OF FOUR
SHE SAID WHAT'S THAT
AND HE SAID YES AND THEY HOP ACROSS THE OCEAN
AND SHE SAID HOW WOULD I DO THAT
ONE LAST LITTLE BIT AND I'LL STOP
THE SCORES WENT UP TO 50 WHICH IS WHAT THE POSH SCHOOLS OF NEW DELHI WITH A TRAINED BIOTECHNOLOGY TEACHER
CAN YOU SHOW ME SOME MORE
EACH GROUP OF FOUR CAN USE ONE COMPUTER AND NOT FOUR COMPUTERS
WHAT IS THAT
CAN YOU DO THAT AGAIN
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING
MAKE YOURSELF UNDERSTOOD TO THE COMPUTER
SO THEY COULD DO THAT ON THEIR OWN
CLARKE WHO SAID I WANT TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON
I TRAINED AS A DOCTOR ABOUT 30 YEARS AGO
MY EYELIDS FELT A LITTLE HEAVY I OPENED THEM AND I WAS ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ROAD WITH A CAR SPEEDING
WHEN YOU BREAK A BONE IT GROWS BACK
I'D WORKED ABOUT 112 HOURS IN THIS WEEK
THIS IS WHAT TO REMIND YOURSELF OF WHEN YOU RE IN A DIP
SO NOW WE'VE GOT THE INSIGHT
THAT S WHAT I THOUGHT
BUT THEY CAN BE A BIT LIKE GEOLOGISTS
HOW ABOUT THAT
BUT THE TIME THAT I M REFERRING TO HAPPENED 250 MILLIONS YEARS AGO
AND WHAT THEY LEFT US
WE WANT TO BUILD OUR OWN IDENTITIES OUR OWN FABRIC CREATE AN OPEN DIALOGUE SO THAT WE SHARE OUR
WE SHOULD NOT UNDERESTIMATE IT
WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE WHAT THERE IS IN THE WEST
WE DO HAVE ARTISTS BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE NOT DISCOVERED THEM YET
WE DON'T WANT THEIR COLLECTIONS
AND YES QATAR WANTS TO BE A MODERN NATION
AND THEREFORE TRADITION BECOMES MORE IMPORTANT NOT LESS IMPORTANT
WE'RE TRYING TO BE PART OF THIS GLOBAL VILLAGE BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE REVISING OURSELVES THROUGH OUR
BUT IF YOU'VE THE ABILITY TO PERSEVERE AND FIND WHAT'S TRULY UNIQUE TO YOU AND START
BUT WE'LL COMEBACK TO THAT LATER SO TRY TO STICK WITH ME
WITHOUT TAKING THE CHANCE OF RUINING SOME OF WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE IN ORDER TO PROGRESS FURTHER
SO I WILL TRY TO SHOW YOU THAT TODAY
THESE ARE THOSE WHO CONFORM THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SO FOCUSED ON KEEPING THEIR PICTURE PRETTY
IN FACT IT'S THE RUBIK'S CUBE THAT SHOW US THAT PROGRESS CANNOT BE MADE WITHOUT TWISTING THE GEARS
SO ALMOST ANYWHERE I WENT THERE THEY WERE
AND THAT SEEMS FINE
THERE WAS ONE WHO WOULD COME AS A FAIRY PRINCESS
AND THAT WHAT THIS OBJECT WAS JUST AS MUCH IN A WAY IN ITS OWN WAY AS A LEONARDO DA VINCI PAINTING IS A
SO MAYBE IT'S TIME WE GOT THIS BACK A LITTLE
I LOVE HIS ORANGE AND PINK BREECHES
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE LOOKS
AND THEN I MOVED GRADUALLY AROUND FEELING A LITTLE LOST SOMETIMES
IT REMINDED ME IN AN ODD KIND OF WAY OF MY NIECE'S FIFTH BIRTHDAY PARTY
WHERE ALL THE LITTLE GIRLS WOULD COME EITHER AS A PRINCESS OR A FAIRY
IN THE CASE OF THESE SOUTHERN SCANDINAVIANS LIVING NEAR THE COAST THEY WERE FISHING MARINE FISH
I CAME ALONG THIS STUDY AND I GOT STUCK I COULD NOT LET GO OF IT UP TO THIS DAY
31 OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ORIGINATE FROM OUR FOOD CONSUMPTION
I WAS IN THE GRIPS OF REAL LONELINESS BACK THEN BUT I WAS SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE ALL DAY SO IT
HE HAD VISIBLE TUMORS ALL OVER HIS BODY
JUST SHAKE IT OFF IT'S ALL IN YOUR HEAD
NOW ADULTS GET TRICKED THIS WAY AS WELL ALL THE TIME
AND SO EACH TIME I HAD A WORRYING UPSETTING NEGATIVE THOUGHT I FORCED MYSELF TO CONCENTRATE ON
I WOKE UP THE NEXT MORNING
I RECENTLY WAS AT A FRIEND'S HOUSE AND THEIR FIVE YEAR OLD WAS GETTING READY FOR BED
HE WAS STANDING ON A STOOL BY THE SINK BRUSHING HIS TEETH WHEN HE SLIPPED AND SCRATCHED HIS
HE CRIED FOR A MINUTE BUT THEN HE GOT BACK UP GOT BACK ON THE STOOL AND REACHED OUT FOR A BOX OF
SO WE GOT STARTED
WHAT'S A PROBLEM YOU WANT TO SOLVE
IT'S FANTASTIC IT'S GOING TO BLOW YOUR MIND
SO WE STARTED WITH THEM SAYING WELL WHAT DO YOU WANT
ARE WE DESIGNING FOR THE WORLD THAT'S COMING WHETHER WE'RE READY OR NOT
WE DECIDED WE CAN'T PUT A DO NOT ENTER SIGN NEXT TO THE VENT
I'VE SINCE LEARNED THAT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD YOU HAVE TO DESIGN OUTCOMES
ARE WE DESIGNING FOR THE WORLD THAT WE WANT
THERE'S ONE WAY TO TREAT JAUNDICE AND THAT'S WHAT'S CALLED AN EXCHANGE TRANSFUSION
FROM A PHOTOTHERAPY STANDPOINT MAYBE NOT THE BEST BEHAVIOR
PROBABLY WHAT HAPPENED IS A HOSPITAL IN JAPAN UPGRADED THEIR EQUIPMENT AND DONATED THEIR OLD STUFF TO NEPAL
I'M GOING TO START WITH AN EXAMPLE FROM SOME WORK THAT WE DID ON NEWBORN HEALTH
SO HERE'S A PROBLEM FOUR MILLION BABIES AROUND THE WORLD MOSTLY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
IT TURNS OUT HALF OF THOSE KIDS OR ABOUT 1
YOU WRITE THE CHECK AND INSTANTLY IT DEPRECIATES 30 PERCENT
MAYBE TWO YEARS IF YOU READ EIGHT HOURS A DAY
WHY DON'T YOU DO THAT
WHAT DON'T YOU DO THIS
I GOT A JOB FOR YOU AS A FOREMAN ON A FRAMING CREW
APOLLONIAN MINDSET CREATES MOUNTAINS OF WASTE
BY THE MIDDLE OF THE 19TH CENTURY IT'S IN FULL FLOWER
THAT HAPPENS IN THE BUILDING INDUSTRY AS WELL
I HAVE 5 BROTHERS AND 4 SISTERS
AND BY DOING SO I WAS ABLE TO SEE A CONSTANT IN MY LIFE
IN THE FOURTH GRADE WE HAD A POP QUIZ ON A SHORT STORY WE HAD READ TOGETHER AS A CLASS
UNCLE ED WOULD BE HOME BY 7
AND MY SISTER WAS DATING AN EX CON
IF I CATCH MYSELF BEING TOO PRIVATE I KNOW IT'S BECAUSE I WANT TO HIDE SOMETHING
IN FACT PRIVACY SCARES ME JUST A LITTLE BIT
I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN OUTSPOKEN
THE QUIZ WAS EASY SUPER STRAIGHTFORWARD
10 QUESTIONS ON A STORY WE'D JUST READ
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT I AM BLOOD RELATED TO THIS MAN
AND TO THAT I SAY NO
NO I AM NOT
ARE HIS 4 LEGS PLANTED FIRMLY ON THE GROUND
BUT THEN YOU SUDDENLY REMEMBER THAT THIS CAR YOU BOUGHT COULD NEVER BE FIXED IF A PART BREAKS OR
SO I GREW UP WITH THE HUGE APPRECIATION FOR THE OUTDOORS AND THE KEEN SENSE OF OUR FOOTPRINT ON THE ENVIRONMENTS WE INTERACT
AND IMAGINE THE DEBRIS THAT WOULD BE STREWN EVERYWHERE IF A COLLISION ACTUALLY HAPPENED THOUSANDS OF
WHAT IF THERE ACTUALLY WERE INTERNATIONAL LAWS WITH TEETH THAT ENFORCED END OF LIFE DISPOSAL OF
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULDN'T DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENTS THAT WE RELY AND
AND THEN YOU EYE THAT YOUR FULE GAUGE HAS DROPPED BELOW EMPTY
THERE IS WITHOUT DOUBT CONGESTION IN THE LOW EARTH AND GEOSTATIONARY ORBITS AND WE CANNOT KEEP LAUNCHING NEW
IT JUST WASN'T DESIGNED THAT WAY
THERE'S AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING INTERNET CONNECTIVITY NAVIGATION
THEY'RE ONLY IN PLACE TO LIMIT THE FUTURE CREATION OF DEBRIS
THESE GUIDELINES ARE ALSO NOT LONG TERM THEY'RE NOT PROACTIVE NOR DO THEY ADDRESS THE DEBRIS THAT'S
SATELLITES EVEN PLAY A ROLE IN THE OPERATION OF OUR FINANCIAL AND ENERGY MARKETS
SO MAYBE YOU GET INTO THINGS LIKE HIGH POWERED LASERS OR TUGGING USING NETS OR TETHERS AS CRAZY AS THOSE
THERE'S ALSO COMPLEX SPACE LAWS AND POLITICS THAT WE HAVE TO SORT OUT
NOW MOUNT EVEREST IS ACTUALLY AN INTERESTING COMPARISON OF A NEW APPROACH TO HOW WE INTERACT WITH OUR ENVIRONMENTS
NOW WE SEND SATELLITES TO DIFFERENT ORBITS DEPENDING ON WHAT THEY'RE NEEDED FOR
ONE OF THE MOST COMMON PLACES WE SEND SATELLITES IS THE LOW EARTH ORBIT POSSIBLY TO IMAGE THE SURFACE OF EARTH
IMAGINE IF A ROBOTIC ARM ON SOME SORT OF SPACE TOW TRUCK COULD FIX THE BROKEN COMPONENTS ON A SATELLITE
WHAT IF ALL SATELLITES REGARDLESS OF WHAT COUNTRY THEY WERE BUILT IN HAD TO BE STANDARDIZED IN SOME WAY FOR
YOU'RE OUT OF GAS
THEY MIGHT RUN OUT OF PROPELLANT THEY COULD MALFUNCTION OR THEY MAY JUST NATURALLY REACH THE END OF THEIR
YOU'VE GOT YOUR MUSIC CRANKED YOUR WINDOWS ROLLED DOWN WITH THE COOL BREEZE BLOWING THROUGH YOUR HAIR
IN THAT INSTANT MOMENT OF PANIC YOU SCAN YOUR FRONT DASHBOARD LOOKING FOR WHAT COULD BE WRONG
AND THEN ONE REALLY COOL POSSIBILITY IS THE IDEA OF ORBITAL TOW TRUCKS OR SPACE MECHANICS
THEY WORK A NINE HOUR DAY AND TRAVEL TWO HOURS TO GET THERE AND BACK
APPARENTLY THIS IS QUITE NORMAL
HOW ARE THE DRUMS
SO WE'VE HAD A TRAINING QUESTION WE'VE HAD AN EDUCATIONAL QUESTION THIS IS THE MOTIVATIONAL QUESTION
I DIDN'T HAVE A NICE DRUM LIKE THIS
IT'S CALLED THE COOKIE THIEF BY VALERIE COX
I MEAN TRAINING IS TO WATCH THE BEHAVIOR BUT ONLINE TRAINING IS LIKE PLASTIC SILVERWARE
TEACH THEM ABOUT CONSEQUENCES DRIVE US
SKINNER TAUGHT US THAT TOO IN HIS BOOK BEYOND FREEDOM AND DIGNITY WAY BACK IN 1971
WELL YOU GIVE THEM FEEDBACK
NICE GUYS FINISH LAST
MY PARENTS BOUGHT ME A BEATABLE DRUM AT AN AUCTION
HOW DID YOU LEARN TO DO THAT
SKINNER AND SAID THAT FROM THE DAY YOU WERE BORN EVERYTHING YOU DID WAS BECAUSE YOU WANTED SOMETHING FOR DOING IT
HOW DO YOU INSPIRE PEOPLE TO FEEL COMPETENT
NOW THE MANAGEMENT DEFINITION OF EMPOWERMENT IS GET IT DONE
I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU WHAT THE RESEARCH SAYS ABOUT HOW TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN
REALLY IT'S ALL IN HOW YOU SEE IT
IT'S YOUR PARADIGM
YOU CAN NOT ONE CLICK RE TWEET A PROTECTED TWEET
WE'D LIKE TO SEE IT
TWITTER ALREADY DOES THIS
NOT COOL BRO
HOW DO WE GET THERE
BLACK BOYS DESERVE AND DESPERATELY NEED MORE OF THAT
AND A MAJORITY OF BLACK BOYS ARE RAISED BY SINGLE MOTHERS
BARBERSHOP BOOKS CONNECTS READING TO A MALE CENTERED SPACE AND INVOLVES BLACK MEN
INSTEAD OF FIXATING ON SKILLS AND MOVING STUDENTS FROM ONE READING LEVEL TO ANOTHER
IRBY I CAN'T READ
ACCORDING TO THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION MORE THAN 85 PERCENT OF BLACK MALE FOURTH
I WAS ON TOUR ACROSS CANADA BRANCHING INTO THE US AND EUROPE
I HAD TO WALK AWAY AND MAINTAIN MY INTEGRITY WALKING AWAY FROM BIG DEALS A LOT OF
IT'S CALLED LOVE INC
OUR VIDEO WAS EVERYWHERE
OUR MUSIC WAS EVERYWHERE
BUT WHEN YOU'RE MINDFUL OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN YOUR BODY AND EXTERNALLY AND IT CAN HELP MAYBE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO BRING THE
THEY'RE GOING TO MESS IT UP
BECAUSE THE BRAIN ACTUALLY ISN'T FULLY MATURE UNTIL AROUND THE AGE 25
IF YOU'RE BREAKING UP WITH SOMEONE TAKE THEIR NUMBER OUT OF YOUR PHONE OR TELL YOUR FRIENDS
DOES A BEE HAVE IT
SO THE QUESTION STILL EXISTS
CARL SAGAN SAID THAT WE ARE THE COSMOS' WAY FOR TO KNOW ITSELF
THE OPPOSITE OF MINDFUL IS MIND EMPTY
YOU DON'T SEE WITH YOU EYES YOU PERCEIVE WITH YOU MIND
HOW CAN I KEEP THEM WHEN I DIE
AFTER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME ENOUGH TWEETS WILL CAUSE SOMETHING TO TREND
WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS 2
THE LAYER OF SAND THAT WE FOUND IS OVER ON THE RIGHT
AND THIS IS THE START OF GLACIATION
I'M INTERESTED IN WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW
IT DEPICTS ACTUALLY THE RESOLUTION THAT WE KNOW MOST OF OUR OCEANS AT
THAT MEANS 90 OF OUR OCEAN IS VERY POORLY MAPPED OR SIMPLY
SO REALLY WHAT YOU END UP HAVING HERE IS NOT A GUAR AND NOT A MOUFLON BUT A
THEY'VE NOW CREATED AN ORGANIC ROBOT
BUT SOMETHING MUCH MUCH MORE POWERFUL IS HAPPENING NOW
THEY HAVE IT RUNNING THROUGH MAZES CONTROLLING WHERE IT'S GOING
WE CAN MANIPULATE THE PLASMAS OF LIFE WITH UNPRECEDENTED POWER AND IT CONFERS ON US A
IS EVERYTHING OKAY
WE HAVE TWO KINDS OF DNA IN OUR BODIES
AND IF YOU THINK OF DOGS FOR EXAMPLE DOGS ARE NOW INTENTIONALLY DESIGNED CREATURES
DOGS ARE THE RESULT OF SELECTIVELY BREEDING TRAITS THAT WE LIKE
WE DON'T HAVE TO DO IT THAT WAY ANYMORE
I LET GO AND DECIDED TO ASK THE READERS OF MY BLOG FOR ADVICE AND LET THEM DECIDE WHICH JOB I WOULD
I THINK ACTUALLY THAT'S VERY GOOD ADVICE
I WOULDN'T WANT TO CONTRADICT THAT
IF YOU ASK MOST PARENTS THEY SAY YES WE DID PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING
BUT THINGS GET EVEN MORE COMPLICATED
THAT STILL SOUNDS A LITTLE TECHNICAL I KNOW
THOUGH FASHION AND ARCHITECTURE CLEARLY AIM TO IDENTIFY CERTAIN CULTURAL AND SOCIETAL IDENTITIES
FASHION REFERS TO THE ARTICLES ONE WEARS BUT STYLE IS HOW YOU PUT IT TOGETHER AND HOW CONFIDENT YOU FEEL
SOME OF IT WILL BE IN OUR ATMOSPHERE FOR A CENTURY MAYBE MUCH LONGER
BECAUSE IN THE MEANTIME EMISSIONS WILL HAVE ACCUMULATED
THERE'S SUN BEATING DOWN THERE'S CONCRETE AND GLASS ALL AROUND YOU
SO THIS POSES REALLY BIG CHALLENGES FOR US
ALL OF THAT WILL TAKE TIME
WHEN WE ARE ALL THE SAME WHY DO WE HATE FIGHT AND CRY
WE ARE ALL BORN DIFFERENT TO DIFFERENT FATHERS AND MOTHERS BUT WE ARE ALL THE SAME
I LOVE CHILDREN AND CHILDREN LOVE TO PLAY WITH ME
I GOT THE ANSWER
HOWEVER THERE WAS A PROBLEM BECAUSE I GOT SOMEWHERE AROUND
WITH VACCINES AND MEDICINES TO TREAT HIV MALARIA TB
IT IS STILL ROUGH
THE NEAREST PHARMACY IS 20 KM AWAY
MY COLLEAGUES AND I IN CURA AO ARE INTERESTED IN LOOKING FORWARD AT WHAT MIGHT BE
WHATEVER THE CAUSE WE HAVE MUCH MORE WORK TO DO BEFORE WE CAN USE BABY CORALS
DON'T GET ME WRONG
DOESN'T MATTER HOW GREAT I AM
WITH YOUR SPEAKING VOICE YOU'VE NEVER LOST IT
DOESN'T MATTER HOW GREAT I AM AS A BASSIST OR ANY INSTRUMENT
I CAN DO IT THROUGH MUSIC AND I'M STILL SAFE
AND WE WERE ABLE TO USE MUSIC TO GIVE THEM AN IDEA WHAT THE NEXT FOUR YEARS OF THEIR LIFE MIGHT BE LIKE
POLITICS RACISM EQUALITY INEQUALITY RELIGION
THAT'S THE MISTAKE A LOT OF US MUSIC TEACHERS MAKE
YOU'RE STUCK IN THE BEGINNING CLASS
THINK ABOUT IT
WHEN YOU'RE 2 3 YEARS OLD AND YOU SAY A WORD WRONG OVER AND OVER NO ONE CORRECTS YOU
I AM PROUD THAT MY PERSONAL ENGAGEMENT AND ENTHUSIASM TOWARDS THIS TOPIC OF CARERS FOUND AN ECHO IN MY
THE OBJECTIVE IS TO EMPOWER CARERS TO IMPROVE THEIR OWN HEALTH AND WELL BEING AND BRING ABOUT A GREATER
AND ABOVE ALL HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE THAT THEIR VALUE TO PATIENTS OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND
MY COMPANY IS COMMITTED TO THIS CAUSE AND HAS DEVELOPED AN UNPRECEDENTED FRAMEWORK FOR ITS
WHAT YOU DO IS EXTREMELY PRECIOUS
IF CARERS AROUND THE WORLD FELT BETTER RECOGNIZED IT WOULD NOT ONLY IMPROVE THEIR OWN HEALTH AND WELL BEING AND
I WANT TO GIVE YOU JUST ONE EXAMPLE FROM AUSTRALIA IN 2015
THEY COULDN'T FIGURE IT OUT
I'VE BEEN WORKING IN THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR FOR THE LAST 15 YEARS AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DREW ME TO THIS SECTOR
CARERS ALL OVER THE WORLD ARE SACRIFICING THEIR OWN PHYSICAL FINANCIAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL
IT'S NOT A PAID EVENT
SO WHO IS SHOWCASING CULTURE
I'VE GOT SOME WONDERFUL PEOPLE HERE WHO WON THE GLOBAL VOTE
WHEN PEOPLE TURN INWARDS AND TURN BACKWARDS HUMAN PROGRESS BECOMES REVERSED AND THINGS GET WORSE FOR EVERYBODY
WE'VE GOT THE EX PRIME MINISTER OF NEW ZEALAND WHO WOULD BE A WONDERFUL MEMBER OF THE TEAM
I RECKON IF YOU'RE STANDING TO BECOME THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES YOU'RE PROBABLY PRETTY TIED UP MOST OF THE
WE ALWAYS GET IT WRONG BY THE WAY
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT'S A PRETTY BANAL STATEMENT OF WHAT POLITICIANS HAVE ALWAYS DONE AND PROBABLY SHOULD ALWAYS DO
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM ACTUALLY WITH DONALD TRUMP'S CREDO OF AMERICA FIRST
AND SO VERY OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE TO COOPERATE AND WE HAVE TO COLLABORATE AS NATIONS IF WE'RE GOING TO
IT'S SO OBVIOUS AND YET WE DON'T
AND SOME OF THEM DO MUCH MORE THAN ANSWER
140 MILLION AMERICANS VOTED FOR THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND YET AS ALL OF US
WHAT IS YOUR VISION FOR YOUR COUNTRY'S FUTURE IN THE WORLD
DON'T GET ME WRONG
AND NOW YOU COULD SEE THEM
PLEASE TELL ME WHAT HAVE I DONE
AND THE BOY RAISED HIS HAND AND HE SAID MR
AND AS WELL LIKE SCHEHERAZADE THEY WERE WELL EDUCATED WOMAN
PLEASE SISTER ALLOW ME TO SEE YOUR FACE ONE LAST TIME
THIS IS THE HEAD IN HANDS MOMENT
SO I WENT TO THE ART ACADEMY IN LATVIA AND ASKED AN ARTIST
PLEASE STOP SENDING IN THOSE PICTURES OF DOGS IT'S NOT ABOUT THIS
IT'S NOT A RELATIONSHIP
I WENT ON TO STUDY PSYCHOLOGY TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS WRONG WITH ME WHAT WAS THE
AND BY THE TIME I WAS FINISHED I WAS SURROUNDED BY A PILE OF A HUNDRED BOOKS AND I HAD BEEN ABLE TO READ
GEOMETRY WAS A NIGHTMARE
SO I PULLED ANOTHER BOOK OFF THE SHELF OPENED IT READ IT AND UNDERSTOOD IT
SO I SOLDIERED ON
I WOULD BANG AND BUMP INTO THINGS ON THE LEFT SIDE OF MY BODY
IF I PUT THIS LEFT HAND ON THE HOT BURNER I WOULD FEEL PAIN BUT I HAD NO IDEA WHERE IT WAS
I COULD NOT JUDGE HOW FAR AWAY WAS THAT CAR
IT'S AN EASY STEP TO START TO GET INVOLVED IN THIS MOVEMENT
YOU'LL BE TRANSFORMED INTO A BIGGER VERSION OF YOURSELF ONE THAT STRETCHES BACKWARDS THROUGH
THE FIRST THING IS TO ASK YOURSELF WHAT BREAKS YOUR HEART
AT THE END SHE SAYS
THEY BOTH ATTENDED BALL STATE TEACHERS COLLEGE IN THE LATE 1950S
WELL HOW CAN I DO THAT
WHAT'S THE EASIEST WAY IN
BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE A TON OF WORK
AND SO BOMBERS STRUCK THEIR 2008 8TH WORLD PERFORMING ARTS FESTIVAL IN LAHORE
HE TOLD ME ONE DAY WE SAW THE IMAM ON TV CALLING US INFIDELS AND SAYING THESE
AS FAIZAN SAID AT THE TIME IF WE BOW DOWN TO THE ISLAMISTS WE'LL JUST BE SITTING IN A DARK CORNER
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS THE MUSLIM EXTREME RIGHT AND THE FACT THAT ITS ADHERENTS ARE OR PURPORT
AND LATER THAT SAME NIGHT THE PEER ZAIDA'S MADE A VERY DIFFICULT DECISION
BUT HE DOESN'T JUST CRITICIZE THE MOSQUE HE ALSO TAKES ON THE GOVERNMENT FOR ITS FAILURE TO DO MORE TO PREVENT
AN AFGHAN PROSECUTOR HAS BEEN ASSASSINATED
17 PM WHICH WE KNOW BECAUSE WHEN SHE FELL IN THE STREET HER WATCH BROKE
AND SHE SAID I KNOW THAT BUT I CAME TO YOUR FESTIVAL WITH MY MOTHER WHEN I WAS THEIR AGE AND I
AND THEN THE NEXT YEAR THEY LOST ALL OF THEIR SPONSORS DUE TO THE SECURITY RISK
WHEN I LOOK BACK NOW I THINK THAT THAT WAS THE MOMENT THAT SET ME ON THE PATH TO WRITING A BOOK CALLED YOUR
LET ME JUST GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE
SOME USE AND ADVOCATE VIOLENCE SOME DO NOT BUT THEY ARE OFTEN INTERRELATED
THEY TAKE DIFFERENT FORMS SOME MAY BE NON GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS EVEN HERE IN BRITAIN LIKE CAGE
IT CAN PREVENT THINGS LIKE THIS
WHEN MILLIONS OF CHILDREN EACH AND EVERY DAY ARE BECOMING ORPHANS OF HIV AND AIDS
DON'T LOOK AT THE NEGATIVE IN SOMEONE AND LOOK AT THE POSITIVE
BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF MY FRIENDS WHO'D KILL FOR IT
IT TAKES MORE ENERGY TO HATE THAN TO LOVE
YOU HAVE TO EMBRACE WHO YOU ARE AND EMBRACE WHO OTHERS ARE
SO I CUT A FEW SLICES OFF A LOAF OF BREAD I PUT THEM ONTO A PLATE AND THEN I PUT THEM RIGHT INTO THE
THAT'S THE WAY I LIKE MY TOAST
I HONESTLY HATE MY EYE COLOUR IT LOOKS LIKE CAT PEE
SO NO PROBLEM I GO DOWN TO THE BASEMENT CLIMBED TWENTY STAIRS
THE FIRST OF THE HUMAN NEED
YOU'RE CREATING STORIES THAT YOU CAN SHARE POTENTIALLY EVEN WITH YOUR GRAND CHILDREN
IS GOING TO BECOME AN ADDICTION IF IT MEETS THOSE NEEDS IN A POWERFUL WAY
AT THIS POINT THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION WHICH IS NOT THE VANGUARD OF COOL THEY HAVE A WHOLE PAGE ON THEIR WEBSITE
YOU'RE MEETING YOUR NEED FOR UNCERTAINTY BECAUSE AS WE SAID VARIETY IT'S THE SPICE OF LIFE YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING
YOU DO THE MATH
EVERYBODY IS LOOKING AT YOU AND YOU'RE CREATING AN EXPERIENCE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO REMEMBER AND MAYBE OTHER PEOPLE ARE GOING TO RELIVE
AND THIS IS A FRAMEWORK THAT WE SHARED FIRST WITH ME BY TONY ROBBINS WHO'S PULLED THESE NEEDS TOGETHER BUT IT'S BASED ON
AND I THINK IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE THAT WE COULD PREDICT WHICH BEHAVIORS WOULD SPREAD AND
THAT WHATEVER JOB YOU'RE DOING IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE MAKING PROGRESS FROM DAY TO DAY YOU'RE GOING TO BE EXCITED
THIS IS ALSO WHY WE BUY LOTTERY TICKETS
I'LL SHARE HOW EACH OF THESE FITS WITH STRIIV AS WE GO THROUGH
AND LOOKING AT THE SIX HUMAN NEEDS AGAIN LET'S THINK ABOUT IT
AND I AM TAKING IN A PERSPECTIVE OF THE FLASH MOBER WHICH IS ANOTHER TERM IN THE DICTIONARY
I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR ABOUT IT
AND THIS STRIIV ALSO HAS ADAPTIVE BENCHMARKS
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WAKE UP THAT WHEN YOU CLIMB 374 STAIRS YOU WILL GET AN AWARD CALLED THE STATUE OF LIBERTY
I AM A SCIENTIST AND THIS IS THE KIND OF CLAIM THAT CAN'T BE EMPIRICALLY VALIDATED SO I CAN'T GO OUT AND TEST IT
YOU'RE THE CENTER OF ATTENTION
SO WHEN YOU'RE COMING TOGETHER IN A FLASH MOB WITH OTHER PEOPLE IT'S AS IF YOU BECOME THIS GROUP
AND IT'S NOT MY ACADEMIC CREDENTIALS THAT QUALIFY ME TO SHARE THIS WITH YOU IT'S MY
SO YOU KNOW HOW YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO REACH 10000 STEPS A DAY AS AN IDEAL GOAL FOR LIVING A HEALTHY LIFE AND BEING A HEALTHY
10000 STEPS IS 5 MILES
I'LL BE TALKING WITH YOU TODAY ABOUT A FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING THINGS THAT CREATE ADDICTIVE
SO NOT A CONTAGIOUS BEHAVIOR AND THIS IS WHY WE HAVE TO REGULATE IT
SO NEED FOR SIGNIFICANCE
YOU HAVE CHOSEN NOT TO KNOW
EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF PEOPLE KNOW THERE'S A PROBLEM BUT THEY WON'T SAY ANYTHING
SHE ALWAYS FELT A LITTLE BIT OF AN OUTSIDER ALTHOUGH SHE'S BEEN THERE ALMOST ALL HER LIFE A WOMAN OF RUSSIAN
YOU CAN SEE WILLFUL BLINDNESS IN BANKS WHEN THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE SOLD MORTGAGES TO PEOPLE
AND WHAT THEY'RE VERY PREPARED TO DO IS RECOGNIZE THAT YES THIS IS GOING TO BE AN ARGUMENT
SO THERE'S THIS PROFOUND MYTHOLOGY AROUND WHISTLEBLOWERS WHICH SAYS FIRST OF ALL
AND HE SAID YOU KNOW I'M NOT THE KIND OF GUY TO RAT PEOPLE OUT BUT SOME
SOME OF THE GUYS USED TO VERY HEAVY JOBS SAID I DON'T WANT TO BE A VICTIM
HE'D BEEN A MINER
IT WAS IN THE FOOTBALL GROUND
BUT SHE WAS REALLY AMAZED
WE'VE STARTED TO INCLUDE ADULTS IN THIS PROCESS AS WELL
WE GRADUATED A YEAR AGO FROM UNIVERSITY AND IT WAS PART OF JOE'S FINAL YEAR PROJECT
THEY JUST WANT TO SAY WHAT THEY THINK AND THEY'RE NOT REALLY WILLING TO BE OPEN MINDED ABOUT THE
IT SHOULDN'T BE THIS WAY
SO A FEW WEEKS AGO WE DID A BIG PROJECT FOR THE BRIGHTON COUNCIL
THEY'RE LOUD AND THEY'RE NOISY BUT IT'S IN A REALLY POSITIVE WAY AND IT WORKS REALLY WELL
SO THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE AT THE BEGINNING OF OUR WORKSHOPS THE KIDS WILL SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES AND THE IDEAS AND WHAT THEY LIKE AND
THEY SHOULD BE ASKED WHAT THEY THINK AND WHAT THEY WANT AND SOMETIMES DEVELOPMENTS WILL PUT IN A SLIDE
WITH DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY
SO THIS IS WHAT WE DO THIS IS WHAT JOE AND I DO
WE NEED TO TAKE A STEP BACK
ONE OF THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL CLINICAL TRIALS IN CANCER CAME OUT IN FEBRUARY IN THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE
YOU KNOW ANDY GROVE STEPPED DOWN AS CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD AT INTEL AND ANDY WAS ONE OF MY MENTORS TOUGH
A WHOLE NEW APPROACH INSTEAD OF GIVING HIGH DOSES OF CHEMOTHERAPY BY DIFFERENT
AND HE WAS SAYING DOES HE REALLY WANT TO MEET ANOTHER DOCTOR
PATIENTS IN UPSTATE NEW YORK WHO WERE PART OF THE TRIAL
IT'S TAKING A BIG PICTURE
WHEN ONE IS EXPOSED TO H1N1 YOU TAKE TAMIFLU AND YOU CAN REMARKABLY
THE WAY WE'VE APPROACHED IT IS THE FIELD OF PROTEOMICS AGAIN THIS LOOKING AT THE SYSTEM
PEOPLE GOT UPSET BUT THIS IS THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING TO GO FORWARD
ANOTHER 30 PERCENT WILL RESPOND
SO WHAT WE DO IN OUR FIELD IS WE CHANGE AND INPUT WE GIVE AGGRESSIVE CHEMOTHERAPY AND WE SAY DID THAT
AND I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT FOR THREE HOURS I'M SITTING AT MY DESK AND I'M NOT MOVING AT ALL
TO GET APPROVAL SO I THINK THERE WERE THREE U
SO IT CHALLENGED EVERYTHING WE KNEW IN CANCER IS THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO GET A RESPONSE
BUT IF ONE IS UNFORTUNATE TO GET A DISEASE YOU'LL GO INTO YOUR DOCTOR'S OFFICE HE OR SHE WILL TAKE A DROP OF BLOOD AND
TELL THEM TO ME OR ANYONE ELSE IN OUR FIELD BECAUSE OVER THE LAST 59 YEARS NOTHING HAS CHANGED
WE NEED A RADICALLY DIFFERENT APPROACH
WELL REMEMBER THAT'S NOT EVEN AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE BUT THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY
WE HAVE DISCRETE DATA ELEMENTS WE DON'T HAVE A TIME FUNCTION ON THEM
EARLIER IT WAS REFERRED TO THIS DIRECT LIFE DEVICE
THAT IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE COST EFFECTIVE BEST WAY WE CAN DO THINGS TODAY
THE PROBLEM WITH TECHNOLOGIES LIKE THIS IS THAT IF ONE LOOKS AT PROTEINS IN THE BODY THERE ARE 11
WE'VE ALL MADE A MISTAKE MYSELF INCLUDED BY FOCUSING DOWN BY BEING A REDUCTIONIST
WE COULD DO THE SAME IN CANCER
SO IF YOU LOOK AT CANCERS IT IS VERY RARE EXTREMELY RARE TO HAVE CANCER IN A CHILD
SO INSTEAD OF A REDUCTIONIST VIEW WE'RE TAKING A STEP BACK
AS ONE GETS OLDER
COME UP WITH NEW IDEAS
THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS THAT YOU PREVENT ANY OF THESE THINGS FROM HAPPENING
ONCE YOU LEARN THEM YOU CAN DO THIS AT YOUR DESKS
IT'S QUITE INCREDIBLE
I WANT TO TELL YOU A STORY
NOT THE FRONT THE SIDES
HE KNEW THE CABLE BUSINESS INTIMATELY AND FOR ALL ITS FLAWS TCI WAS THE FOURTH LARGEST CABLE COMPANY IN THE UNITED STATES AT THAT POINT IN A
HERE'S SOME BACK STORY
AND IF I RECOGNIZE IT WILL I HAVE THE GUTS TO MAKE THE LEAP MYSELF
MCLAGLEN WHO WAS 91 YEARS OLD AND STILL DIRECTS PLAYS UP IN FRIDAY HARBOR WASHINGTON AND THE STORY GOES MORE LIKE THIS
WHAT MORE COULD YOU ASK FROM A MOVIE
AND THEN I CALLED THE DIRECTOR ANDREW V
IT WAS NOT AS HIS BIOGRAPHER PUT IT THE FORTUNE EITHER FINANCIAL OR PERSONAL
I HAVE TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST
I FIND THEM DAUNTING A LITTLE BIT UNSETTLING
NOW THOSE ARE THE LEGENDS
WE HAVE CREATED SUCH A SITUATION ARTIFICIALLY
WE NEED TO REARRANGE THE PATTERN
WE CAN NOW ACTUALLY INTERFERE WITH THEIR PSYCHOLOGY IN RATHER PROFOUND WAYS AS I'LL SHOW YOU IN MY LAST
WE HEARD SOME OF THOSE KINDS OF STRATEGIES BEING USED IN THE TESLA MOTORS CAR TODAY
I SAID HOW COME YOU'RE NOT DOING SUSTAINABILITY
IT'S WITH HOW PEOPLE USE THE PRODUCT
THESE KINDS OF APPROACHES ARE NOT HARD BUT UNDERSTANDING THE SYSTEM AND THEN LOOKING FOR VIABLE
I KNOW YOU KNOW THIS
THE MOMENT THAT VERY POPULAR TV SHOWS END
SO ESSENTIALLY EVERYTHING THAT IS CREATED GOES THROUGH A SERIES OF LIFE CYCLE STAGES AND WE USE THIS
ITS LITTLE CARBON MOLECULES THAT IT STORED UP AS IT WAS GROWING ARE NATURALLY RELEASED BACK INTO THE ATMOSPHERE AS CARBON
THAT'S THE LATEST U
HE HAD A LOVELY SENSE OF HUMOR TOO
WHEN I HAVE THAT NEW CLIENT I'LL BE HAPPY
THAT MOMENT WHEN ALL OF THAT ANGER AND THAT PAST RESENTMENT JUST DISAPPEARS IT GOES AWAY IT NO LONGER
LET GO OF YOUR TIME CLOCK
WHEN I HAVE THAT NEW RELATIONSHIP I'LL BE HAPPY
EGO WORKS IN SO MANY VICIOUS WAYS
THE SECOND STEP IS A FOREGONE SURRENDER
OF COURSE THERE ARE MANY MOMENTS WHEN I AM DISCONNECTED FROM MY TRUTH BUT I KNOW WHERE TO GO I SIT DOWN ON THAT MEDITATION
EACH WOMAN ON THE STAGE TODAY HAD WILLINGNESS IN SOME FORM TO MAKE A CHANGE AND THAT'S WHY SHE IS WHO SHE IS TODAY
WHEN I HAVE THAT NEW PAIR OF SHOES I'LL BE HAPPY
IT'S AN UNLEARNING OF THE NEGATIVITY OF THE LACK OF THE COMPARING OF THE SEPARATION
THE HOLY INSTANT IS WHEN AN ANCIENT HATRED BECOMES A HOLY LOVE
ONE MOMENT AT A TIME WE EXPERIENCE WHAT THE COURSE REFERS TO AS THE HOLY INSTANT THE MOMENT THAT WE
THE EGO WANTS US TO SEE EVERYONE AS SEPARATE
THEN WE HAVE MORE VITALITY
BEFORE I CAME OUT HERE ON THE STAGE I SAID SOME PRAYERS WITH SOME OF MY SISTERS AND WE WERE IN THE BACK AND I SAID MAY ALL THE GODDESSES OF THE
IF WE'RE NOT LIVING IN THAT FAITH THEN WHAT ARE WE DOING
EACH OF US AT SOME POINT IN TIME AND IN SOME WAY WE HAVE CHOSEN THAT TINY MAD IDEA AND AS THE COURSE SAYS
I AM HERE TO BE A STUDENT AND A TEACHER OF A COURSE IN MIRACLES
AND I WENT TO MARIANE AND SAID HOW WOULD YOU SUGGEST I CARRY THIS MESSAGE TO MY GENERATION
WHEN WE OPEN UP TO THINK WITH LOVE AND WE ALLOW THE VOICE OF OUR INNER GUIDANCE SYSTEM TO COME FORWARD WE
LET GO OF YOUR PLANS
I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH BECAUSE I HAD A TERRIBLE CASE OF THE WHEN I HAVES
ALL WE HAVE IS 18 MINUTES TO SPEAK TO YOU
SO I'VE BEEN UP SINCE 3 AM
I LIVE MY TRUTH I WALK MY TRUTH I BREATHE MY TRUTH
WHEN WE HAVE FULL FAITH THAT WE CAN SHOW UP WITHOUT AN OUTLINE OR WE CAN HAVE FULL FAITH THAT WE
THEN WE HAVE MORE HEALTH THEN WE HAVE MORE DIRECTION
THAT IS THE COLOR
PEOPLE GENERALLY DON'T LIKE A YELLOW PLUM
UP UNTIL THAT POINT I GREW UP ON A FARM BUT I HADN'T REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT
THE SECOND IS THE SIZE
IS IT A SINGLE SERVING SIZE
HARD IS HARD
WHO CAN TELL ME THAT HIS COMING OUT STORY IS HARDER THAN TELLING YOUR FIVE YEAR OLD YOU'RE GETTING A DIVORCE
WE NEED TO STOP RANKING OUR HARD AGAINST EVERYONE ELSE'S HARD TO MAKE US FEEL BETTER OR WORSE ABOUT OUR CLOSETS AND JUST
I TRAVEL AROUND THE STATE LITERALLY ALMOST EVERYDAY
AND BY THE WAY AGAIN FOR THAT GROUP UP THERE THAT'S WORRIED ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS GOING TO
GERMANY HAS AS MANY BILLIONAIRES PER CAPITA AS WE DO
AND THERE ARE SO MANY MOVING PARTS THAT ADD UP TO A WALKABLE CITY
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
EACH ONE IS COMFORTABLE TO WALK ON
HOW WIDE ARE THEY
WE WANT SIGNS OF PEOPLE
AND HERE YOU KNOW THIS STREET
NOTHING INTERESTS US MORE THAN OTHER PEOPLE
SO WHEN WE LOOK AT A DOWNTOWN AREA AT A PLACE THAT HAS A HOPE OF BEING WALKABLE AND MOSTLY THAT'S OUR DOWNTOWNS IN AMERICA'S
AND LIFESPANS INCREASED IMMEDIATELY DRAMATICALLY AND WE LIKE TO SAY THE PLANNERS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO REPEAT THAT
AND IT'S DEFINED AS BEING WALKABLE
THERE ARE LOTS OF SMALL STREETS
I HAVE TO USE WORDS
THEY LIKE WINNING
CAN YOU GET THIS ON A RUNNING BACK
THEY WANT TO BE THEIR FAVORITE PLAYER
FANS WANT TO BE ON THAT FIELD
IT WAS MORE ENTERTAINING
BECAUSE TEAMS ALWAYS USE TECHNOLOGY TO WIN GAMES
HOW DO WE USE THIS TO WIN GAMES
IT'S ALSO FOR JOCKS
WE WANT THAT EXPERIENCE
I THINK ADULT DIAPER SALES MAY SURGE
BUT THE QUESTION I ASK YOU IS IS THAT'S ALL THAT WE'RE CONTENT TO USE AUGMENTED REALITY FOR
NORMALLY YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SEE HIM BUT THE AUGMENTED REALITY SYSTEM LETS YOU KNOW
HE GOES CATCHES THE BALL SPRINTS IN TOUCHDOWN
FANS WANT TO BE ON THE FIELD
EVEN THOUGH THERE'S A COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS THAT STARS FORM ONE OF THE MOST ROBUST IS THIS PROCESS
LIKE THE WORLD I CAME TO IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE WORLD THAT I LEFT
AND IT WAS A VERY SLOW PROCESS
A SELF DRIVING CAR
AND THIS IS ACTUALLY REALLY A CENTRAL PART OF THE HEMOGLOBIN MOLECULE BECAUSE THIS IS THE THING THAT ALLOWS US TO BIND
BECAUSE WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD GALAXIES COLLIDE
IT REQUIRED A DEPTH OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING
I MEAN I HAD NO PURPOSE IN THIS LIFE
AND THEY'RE NOW CALLED CHLOROPLASTS
IT WAS A COLOR IN THE PALETTE OF BEING THAT YOU COULDN'T PAINT WITH
IT MIGHT COME FROM THE WAY THAT YOU EXPRESS YOURSELF AS A HUMAN BEING
IT SAYS THAT THE WAY THAT WE ARE IN OUR LIVES THE WAY THAT WE AFFECT OUR FRIENDS AND OUR FAMILY BEGIN TO
AND IT'S WORTH THINKING THAT MAYBE THE MEANING OF OUR LIVES ARE ACTUALLY NOT EVEN WITHIN THE SCOPE OF OUR UNDERSTANDING
AND ONE OF THOSE GAPS THAT I'VE SEEN IS AROUND THIS CONCEPT AND THE CONCEPT IS A REALLY SIMPLE ONE
WELL ACTUALLY THEY NEVER REALLY LEFT US
EACH ONE OF THESE WAYS OF BEING THESE THINGS THAT WE PUT OUT INTO THE WORLD THROUGH THE CREATIVE PROCESS OF MIXING
IT'S AN ELEMENT OF ALMOST EVERY SPIRITUAL TRADITION OF HUMANKIND THROUGHOUT ALL OF HISTORY
BUT WHENEVER I HEAR PEOPLE TALK AND MENTION THIS PHRASE THAT WE ARE ALL CONNECTED THEY DO SO IN
AND TODAY I'M HERE TO DESCRIBE THAT EVERYTHING REALLY IS CONNECTED AND NOT IN SOME ABSTRACT
IT MIGHT COME FROM A PIECE OF ARTWORK THAT YOU CREATE
BUT I ALSO HAVE A PERSONAL STAKE IN THIS
A FEW YEARS AGO OUR RESEARCH TEAM FOUND THAT 30 OF WOMEN IN THE UNITED STATES REPORTED
I ALSO THINK THAT THE WAY WE'RE EXPECTING IT TO CHANGE IS BROKEN
IF WE SIT AROUND WAITING FOR POLITICIANS AND SCHOOL SYSTEMS AND PARENTS TO CHANGE THIS
ALL OF THESE FORM OF POWER ARE AT PLAY
END OF STORY
THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH POLITICS
AND I BELIEVE THE WAY WE MAKE CIVICS SEXY AGAIN IS TO MAKE EXPLICITLY ABOUT THE TEACHING OF
BUT THIS TELLS US HOW WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT IT AND WHERE WE NEED TO GO
BUT WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS AND BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE TECHNOLOGIES YOU HEAR ABOUT TODAY WE ARE ACTUALLY ABLE TO BEGIN TO STRING THIS
THAT'S NOT EARLY INTERVENTION
ARE WE GOING TO BE THERE SOON
WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE FACTS
EARLY DETECTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY NOT ONE OF THEM
1 MILLION LIVES EVERY YEAR IN THIS COUNTRY TO HEART DISEASE
WE ALL HAVE A VOICE AND A PLACE IN THE FRAGMENTED SYSTEMS AROUND US
EMOTIONAL LITERACY IS THE ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND AND COMMUNICATE ABOUT EMOTIONS BOTH YOUR OWN AND
LET ME START RIGHT HERE AND SAY WE'RE NOT GOING TO CONVERT EVERYBODY TO POLYAMORY
THE MORE YOUR RECEIVE THE MORE YOU WANT TO GIVE
THAT REALLY STARTS WITHIN ONESELF
ANY KIND OF DIFFERENCE IS MORE ACCEPTABLE IN THE POLYAMOROUS COMMUNITY BECAUSE WE'RE ALREADY SO FAR OUT THERE
WE MIGHT ACTUALLY GET SOMETHING DONE IN POLITICS IF WE CAN TALK ABOUT THINGS IN A REASONABLE MANNER
EACH TIME YOU HAVE TO SIT DOWN WITH YOUR PARTNERS AND SAY
WHAT DO WE WANT OUT OF OUR RELATIONSHIPS
YOUR FIRST LOGICAL QUESTION IS WHAT IS POLYAMORY
AND THAT'S HOW LOVE WORKS
IT'S A POSITIVE FEEDBACK CYCLE
THE MORE YOU GIVE THE MORE YOU HAVE TO GIVE
THIS DOES NOT HAVE TO BE YOUR BELT BUCKLE
AND I THINK IT IS TOUGH
LET US TREAT THEM WITH RESPECT
AND 99000 PEOPLE DIE EVERY YEAR BECAUSE OF HOSPITAL BASED INFECTIONS
SO I HAVE GOT MY METAL ALBUM I HAVE GOT MY 3D ANIMATION AND GRAPHIC DESIGN GOING I HAVE
YOU BITE THE BULLET BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO
THEY DO NOT HAVE THE TOOLS TO BE SUCCESSFUL
WE HAD TO GO OUT WE HAD TO GET SOME PERSPECTIVE
AND I THINK IT IS ON THE OTHER SIDE AS WELL
AND THEN IT BECAME A BUTTON WITH MORE BUTTONS
FIND ONE THAT MAKES SENSE FOR WHO YOU ARE
AND PREPARE WE DID
WE PREPARED SO HARD
I MEAN THIS IS PRETTY SIMPLE RIGHT
FOR ME THE BELT BUCKLE IS A MOTTO
AND THEY ARE RIGHT NEXT TO YOU
AND YOU ARE INTERACTING WITH THEM
WHAT IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING THAT HAPPENED IN YOUR LIFE
BUT THE WHALES WILL STILL BE IN CONCRETE TANKS
THE BEST SOLUTION IS TO BUILD NATURAL SEASIDE SANCTUARIES WHERE CAPTIVE WHALES AND DOLPHINS CAN
KEIKO ALWAYS LOVED TO CHASE BIRDS ACROSS HIS BAY
EVEN A SHATTERED DREAM CAN DO THAT FOR YOU
IT IS NOT IMPORTANT IF I LIKE THE JOB OR NOT
ITS MOST IMPORTANT PURPOSE IS TO GET US IN TOUCH WITH WHERE DREAMS COME FROM
SO I WAS DETERMINED TO FIND ANOTHER CALLING
NOBODY AROUND TO TEACH ME
IT'S A STANDARD PRACTICE IN THE ACADEMIC WORLD
I WASN'T ALWAYS THIS ENTHUSIASTIC ALTHOUGH I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A STRONG BELIEVER IN SPACE
WE ARE NOT SIMPLY CREATING TECHNOLOGIES TO MAKE A MARS MISSION MORE AFFORDABLE
DID YOU KNOW THAT A SIMPLE ROCK IS 50 OXYGEN BY WEIGHT
IT TURNS OUT THIS WAS IMPORTANT FOR THE HAWAIIANS FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS
I WANT TO PROMISE YOU THIS IS NOT SCIENCE FICTION THIS IS SCIENCE FACT
04 PERCENT OF THE US FEDERAL BUDGET
WE CAN ALSO SEND ROBOTIC CONSTRUCTION CREWS TO EVERY ONE OUT OF THE HUNDREDS OF MOONS AND PLANETS IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM
ACCORDING TO OUR ESTIMATES WE CAN GET THIS ACCOMPLISHED IN 20 YEARS FOR AN ANNUAL COST OF
THEY WOULD BE TALKING EXCITEDLY ABOUT SOME MEASUREMENT THEY WERE MAKING IN A STAR FAR ACROSS THE GALAXY
WE'RE CREATING THIS MACHINE LIFE FORM THIS ROBOTIC ECOSPHERE THIS ROBOTOSPHERE
EVERY DAY ON THIS HIKE THINKING ABOUT THESE THINGS AND CONTRASTING THEM I BEGAN TO REALIZE
THAT IS NOT IN THE REALM OF THE POSSIBLE
YOU MIGHT HAVE GUESSED I DON'T BELIEVE THAT ANYMORE AND HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED THAT CHANGED MY PERSPECTIVE
WE ARE DOING THIS TODAY
AND HOW MUCH WILL IT COST
YOUR GRANDCHILDREN CAN GROW UP IN A WORLD THAT IS SO ALIVE IT'LL MAKE OUR PRESENT ERA
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR LETTING ME SHARE THIS ENTHUSIASM WITH YOU TODAY
WHAT WE'RE DOING IS CREATING THE FIRST GENERATION OF A NEW LIFE FORM A TYPE OF
I HAD READ THE STORIES HOW THE HAWAIIANS ORIGINALLY FOUND HAWAII
THEY CAME FROM TAHITI OVER 2500 MILES AWAY IN DUGOUT CANOES ACROSS OPEN
HOW RAPIDLY CAN WE STAND UP A ROBOTOSPHERE IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM
CLARKE SAID FAMOUSLY ANY SUFFICIENTLY ADVANCED CIVILIZATION IS INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM
DESPITE THIS FANTASTICAL 1000
THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH OTHER NATURAL RESOURCES AND IF WE TRIED TO MOVE TOO FAR IN THAT DIRECTION IT WOULD BE AN
AND THEN WE CAN FILL MARS WITH FORESTS AND LAKES AND STREAMS WITH FISH AND THERE WOULD BE BIRDS IN THE SKY
THAT S THE POINT WHERE THE VISION I DESCRIBED AT THE START OF THIS TALK HAS BECOME THE NEW REALITY FOR HUMAN
IN 2011 I PULLED TOGETHER A FEW OF MY COLLABORATORS TO ASK THE QUESTION
AND THE ADRENAL GLANDS MAKE ANDROGENS WHICH ARE A MASCULINIZING HORMONE
BOTH ARE VIABLE BOTH TAKE OFF
I ALSO WANT TO SAY THERE ARE PROBABLY ALSO SOME YELLOW LABRADORS THAT I KNOW THAT ARE MORE CAPABLE OF INFORMED INTELLIGENT
FOR EXAMPLE I DON'T WANT TO GIVE A FISH THE SAME RIGHTS AS A HUMAN
AND HE WAS BORN LOOKING LIKE A BOY NOBODY SUSPECTED ANYTHING
ONE OF THE PLACES WE'RE SEEING IT FOR EXAMPLE IN OUR CULTURE IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY IS BATTLES OVER THE BEGINNING OF LIFE
THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT GOD AND GOD'S NATURE
NOW I DON'T WANT YOU TO SPEND TOO MUCH TIME IMAGINING THE CONCEPTION BECAUSE IF YOU DO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LISTEN TO ME
AND IF YOU LOOK FOR EXAMPLE IN THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE THEY TALK ABOUT NATURE AND NATURE'S GOD
AND AS A CONSEQUENCE HIS GENITALS WERE MASCULINIZED HIS BRAIN WAS SUBJECT TO THE MORE TYPICAL MASCULINE COMPONENT OF HORMONES
AS WE LOOK WE GET INTO ALL SORTS OF UNCOMFORTABLE AREAS
I HAD A LOT OF JOURNALISTS CALLING ME ASKING ME WHICH IS THE TEST THEY'RE GOING TO RUN THAT WILL TELL US WHETHER OR NOT
FEMINISM IS ALL ABOUT UNDOING STEREOTYPES ABOUT GENDER SO THERE'S NOTHING FEMININE ABOUT FEMINISM
AND IN THE OTHER CASE THE SPERM IS CARRYING AN X CHROMOSOME MEETING THE X CHROMOSOME OF THE EGG
WE LOOK FOR EXAMPLE ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE SHARE AT LEAST 95 PERCENT OF OUR DNA WITH CHIMPANZEES
IN THE PAST OUR ANCESTORS NEVER HAD TO STRUGGLE SO MUCH WITH THIS QUESTION OF WHEN SOMEBODY WAS DEAD
I MEAN THEY WERE SO BRAVE AND SO BOLD AND SO RADICAL IN WHAT THEY DID THAT
THEY WERE MOVING TOWARDS A NATURALISTIC CONCEPT
I DON'T WANT TO SAY A FIVE YEAR OLD SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO CONSENT TO SEX OR CONSENT TO MARRY
LET'S IMAGINE ONE OF THEM MARY IS BORN THREE MONTHS PREMATURELY SO SHE'S BORN ON JUNE 1
AND IT'S NOT JUST IN TERMS OF SEX
SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE XX CHROMOSOMES DEVELOP WHAT ARE CALLED OVOTESTIS WHICH IS WHEN YOU HAVE OVARIAN TISSUE WITH TESTICULAR
AND WE'RE NOT EXACTLY SURE WHY THAT HAPPENS
IT TURNS OUT TO BE REALLY DIFFICULT
WHERE WE WANT TO TAKE VITAL ORGANS OUT OF BEINGS AND GIVE THEM TO OTHER BEINGS
WHAT HAPPENED WAS WOMEN FOR EXAMPLE WHO WANTED THE RIGHT TO VOTE TOOK THE FOUNDING FATHERS' CONCEPT OF
THEY'RE IN THE BACK OF OUR BODY
SOME OF WHAT I'VE WORKED ON IS PEOPLE WHO HAVE DWARFISM SO PEOPLE WHO ARE MUCH SHORTER THAN TYPICAL
AND A LOT OF WHAT I'VE WORKED ON IS PEOPLE WHO HAVE ATYPICAL SEX SO PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE THE STANDARD MALE
HE SAYS WE SHOULD JUDGE PEOPLE BASED NOT ON THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN BUT ON THE CONTENT OF THEIR CHARACTER MOVING
INTERSEX COMES IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT FORMS
I DON'T WANT TO SAY WE GIVE UP ENTIRELY ON ANATOMY
THEY CAN'T SPEAK
FOR INSTANCE MY LITTLE BROTHER HE'S VERY SEVERELY AUTISTIC
HE CAN'T TALK AT ALL
ALL IN ALL I WOULDN'T TRADE MY AUTISM AND MY IMAGINATION FOR THE WORLD
I GOOGLED AUTISTIC PEOPLE ARE
PEOPLE TEND TO DIAGNOSE AUTISM WITH REALLY SPECIFIC CHECK BOX DESCRIPTIONS BUT IN
WHEN SOMETHING VERY EXCITING HAPPENS IN MY INNER WORLD I'VE JUST GOT TO RUN
AND IT RECEIVED QUITE A BIT OF ATTENTION
WHEN I READ THAT I WAS BLOWN AWAY BY THOSE NUMBERS
I WENT DOWN THERE IN THE WINTER TIME
OR YOU OPEN OUR POST BOX AND YOU FIND PILES OF ADVERTISEMENTS WE CALL THAT JUNK
AND I VE BEEN TRULY HONORED TO CO LEAD THIS CONSORTIUM TOGETHER WITH DRS
HOW LONG WAS MUBARAK IN POWER
YOU HAVE THE FEAR HIGH YOU HAVE STATUS QUO
NOW AT THE END NONVIOLENT DISCIPLINE
OF COURSE YOU COULD BET THEY DID THE MOST STUPID THING
SO WHAT'S NEW IN IT
AND CAN YOU LOOK AT THE AGE OF THE PEOPLE ON THE STREETS OF EUROPE
BUT HERE IS ALSO THE BAD NEWS
BUT WHAT IF WE ORGANIZED THE SPRAYING OF GRAFFITI THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT ALL OVER KRAKOW
IT'S ONLY 200 OF US IN THIS ROOM
NOW WHAT DO THE STATISTICS HAVE
AND YOU CAN ALWAYS USE HUMOR
HUMOR IS SUCH A POWERFUL GAME CHANGER AND OF COURSE IT WAS VERY BIG IN POLAND
AND THIS IS PROBABLY THE GAME CHANGER
AND EVERYBODY WAS AMAZED WHEN THE REFRIGERATOR OPENED AND MILLIONS OF YOUNG MAINLY SECULAR
SO I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PHENOMENON WHICH IS BEHIND WHAT ALREADY SEEMS TO BE A
WELL PEOPLE POWER HAS BEEN THERE FOR A WHILE
I ONCE ASKED ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES AT HARVARD HEY IS SOUTH AMERICA PART OF THE WEST
THAT TELLS YOU SOMETHING REALLY IMPORTANT
THE FINANCIAL CRISIS IS REALLY A RELATIVELY SMALL HISTORIC PHENOMENON WHICH HAS JUST ACCELERATED
THE FIRST THING I WANT TO DO IS START WITH A GRAPH
THERE ARE DIFFERING ACCOUNTS OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED THAT AFTERNOON BUT SINCE MY SISTER IS NOT HERE WITH US TODAY LET
JOURNALING ABOUT ONE POSITIVE EXPERIENCE YOU'VE HAD OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS ALLOWS YOUR BRAIN TO RELIVE IT
AND WE TAILOR THE CLASS TOWARDS THE AVERAGE
AND INTO THE SILENCE I SAID I'D BE HAPPY TO SPEAK AT YOUR SCHOOL BUT THAT'S NOT A WELLNESS WEEK THAT'S A SICKNESS WEEK
YOUR BRAIN AT POSITIVE IS 31 MORE PRODUCTIVE THAN YOUR BRAIN AT NEGATIVE NEUTRAL OR STRESSED
NO HUMAN LANDS ON ALL FOURS LIKE THAT
IN FACT WE'VE FOUND THAT EVERY SINGLE BUSINESS OUTCOME IMPROVES
AND ON ONE SIDE OF THE BUNK BED I HAD PUT OUT ALL OF MY G
AND FRIDAY NIGHT WE'RE TRYING TO DECIDE BETWEEN RISKY SEX OR HAPPINESS
AND IF WE CAN CHANGE THE LENS NOT ONLY CAN WE CHANGE YOUR HAPPINESS WE CAN CHANGE EVERY SINGLE EDUCATIONAL AND BUSINESS OUTCOME AT THE SAME TIME
SILENCE ON THE PHONE
YOU'VE OUTLINED ALL THE NEGATIVE THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN BUT NOT TALKED ABOUT THE POSITIVE
YOU GOT GOOD GRADES NOW YOU HAVE TO GET BETTER GRADES YOU GOT INTO A GOOD SCHOOL AND AFTER YOU GET INTO A BETTER ONE YOU GOT A GOOD JOB NOW YOU HAVE
AND IN MY RESEARCH AND MY TEACHING I FOUND THAT THESE STUDENTS NO MATTER HOW HAPPY THEY WERE WITH THEIR ORIGINAL SUCCESS OF GETTING INTO THE

JOE SOLDIERS AND WEAPONRY
IN THE LAST THREE YEARS I'VE TRAVELED TO 45 COUNTRIES WORKING WITH SCHOOLS AND COMPANIES IN THE MIDST OF AN ECONOMIC
IN JUST A TWO MINUTE SPAN OF TIME DONE FOR 21 DAYS IN A ROW WE CAN ACTUALLY REWIRE YOUR BRAIN ALLOWING YOUR
SO WE WERE UP ON TOP OF OUR BUNK BEDS
I NERVOUSLY PEERED OVER THE SIDE OF THE BED TO SEE WHAT HAD BEFALLEN MY FALLEN SISTER AND SAW THAT SHE HAD LANDED PAINFULLY ON HER
AND IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN YOU'VE SEEN THIS HUNDREDS OF TIMES
DID YOU SEE HOW YOU LANDED
EXERCISE TEACHES YOUR BRAIN THAT YOUR BEHAVIOR MATTERS
WE NEED TO REVERSE THE FORMULA FOR HAPPINESS AND SUCCESS
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
AND NONE OF THAT WAS EXPECTED OF ME
I JUST TRAVELED FROM A TO B AND I CAME THERE WITHOUT A PASSPORT
AND INTERFERE WITH OUR GOD GIVEN RIGHT TO MOVE AROUND AS FREE HUMAN BEINGS
OUR ARTERIES CAN CLOG
AND I THINK IT SUPREMELY ILLUSTRATES THE PREMISE OF THIS BLUE ZONE PROJECT
THAT'S WHY A 65 YEAR OLD PERSON IS AGING AT A RATE OF ABOUT 125 TIMES
WHEN THEY DO DO INTENTIONAL PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IT'S THE THINGS THEY ENJOY
DEPRIVE YOUR BRAIN OF OXYGEN FOR JUST A FEW MINUTES THOSE BRAIN CELLS DIE THEY NEVER COME BACK
OUR BRAINS CAN GUNK UP WITH PLAQUE AND WE CAN GET ALZHEIMER'S
AND WE MANAGED TO BOIL IT DOWN TO NINE
THEY ALSO HAVE A 3000 YEAR OLD ADAGE WHICH I THINK IS THE GREATEST SORT OF DIET SUGGESTION EVER INVENTED
THAT BURNS CALORIES JUST AS MUCH AS GOING ON THE TREADMILL DOES
BUT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT YOUR FRIENDS ARE LONG TERM ADVENTURES AND THEREFORE
IF THEY WANT TO MIX UP A CAKE THEY'RE DOING IT BY HAND
WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT THEY ALL DO
THERE IS WHAT DOCTOR OZ TELLS US
AND IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE MAIN ISLAND THIS IS GROUND ZERO FOR WORLD LONGEVITY
THERE IS NOT A BUTTON TO PUSH TO DO YARD WORK OR HOUSE WORK
PLAY TENNIS TOO HARD ON YOUR KNEES RUIN YOUR CARTILAGE THE CARTILAGE NEVER COMES BACK
WHEN IT COMES TO SUPPLEMENTS SHOULD YOU BE TAKING THEM
SO THE PREMISE OF BLUE ZONES IF WE CAN FIND THE OPTIMAL LIFESTYLE OF LONGEVITY WE CAN COME UP WITH A
SO TO MAKE IT TO AGE 100 YOU NOT ONLY HAVE TO HAVE HAD A VERY GOOD LIFESTYLE YOU ALSO HAVE TO HAVE
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY CONVENIENCES
6 TRILLION DOLLARS IN SIZE
SO IT'S EASY TO SEE WHY LANDLORDS WHO MAKE A BUSINESS OF PROVIDING RELEASE HOUSING OPTIONS
DO WE CUT MALES MORE SLACK BECAUSE BOYS WILL BE BOYS AND WE KIND OF EXPECT THEM TO GET INTO A LITTLE
NOW MOST ENCOUNTERS WITH MALE OFFENDERS ARE PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD
WOMEN ARE MORE LIKELY TO BECOME INVOLVED IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM DUE TO POOR COPING STRATEGIES DEALING
BUT WHEN WOMEN FIGHT IT'S ALMOST ALWAYS ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS AND PARTNERS AND JEALOUSY
I SIMPLY WANT TO STAY IN BED
OUR PREFERENCES CHANGE AS WELL
I MAY DECIDE THAT THE DISCOMFORT OF GETTING OUT OF BED EARLY IS LESS
IT'S INTERESTING THAT AS I TALK TO PEOPLE MY SCIENTIFIC COLLEAGUES AS WELL AS OTHERS THERE'S A WIDE VARIETY OF
WE ALSO WANT TO UNDERSTAND BETTER HOW TO CONTROL THE WAY THAT DNA IS REPAIRED AFTER IT'S CUT
BUT I DO THINK THAT BEING INVOLVED IN THE GENESIS OF THIS REALLY PUTS ME AND MY COLLEAGUES IN A
AND ACTUALLY THERE IS AN IMPORTANT PRECEDENT FOR SUCH A PAUSE FROM THE 1970S WHEN SCIENTISTS
WE CAN THINK OF OLDER GENOME ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGIES AS SIMILAR TO
PART OF THE CRISPR SYSTEM IS A PROTEIN CALLED CAS9 THAT'S ABLE TO SEEK OUT
DO IT BADLY FREES YOU UP TO TAKE ACTION
IT TOOK THE ANXIETY OUT OF EVERYTHING AND REPLACED IT WITH EXCITEMENT
THE REASON WHY THIS WORKS SO WELL IS THAT IT SPEEDS UP YOUR DECISION MAKING AND CATAPULTS YOU
THIS WILL PROBABLY MAKE YOU FEEL A LITTLE BIT ANXIOUS AND YOU'LL PROBABLY WANT TO START RUNNING
THIS ANXIOUS FEELING THAT YOU GET IS GOOD BECAUSE IT PROTECTS YOU IT
I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT I MEAN
FIRST WE NEED TO MEASURE IT AND THEN WE NEED TO CURE IT
ALL DIFFERENT SECTORS HAVE FACTS AND THERE ARE ORGANIZATIONS TRYING TO SPREAD AWARENESS ABOUT THESE FACTS
GIVE IT TO THEM AND MEASURE WHAT THE MEDIA KNOW
AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN FOR THE FIRST TIME THE INFORMAL RESULTS FROM A CONFERENCE WITH U
DID YOU SEE HOW IT MOVED
OKAY THIS LITTLE SHORTLIST WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH IT
THAT WILL HELP YOU SCORE BETTER ON OUR TESTS
EVERYBODY ANSWERED THAT QUESTION YEAH I DRIVE CARS BETTER
GAPMINDER ASKED THE PUBLIC IN SWEDEN
THIS IS HOW THEY ANSWERED
SO ALREADY THE PILOTS REVEAL THIS THAT SO MANY IN THE PUBLIC SCORE WORSE THAN RANDOM SO WE HAVE TO THINK
BEAN AND SAFEWAY
AND WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT THIS PROBLEM CAN AND IT'S ALREADY BEING FIXED IN POCKETS ACROSS THE
LET'S CHALLENGE THEM TO TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR HEALTH MORE SERIOUSLY
THAT HAPPENED TO BE MY DAY JOB
LET'S DO IT RIGHT THIS TIME
WE DON'T NEED THOSE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE PLENTY OF THEM HERE
NOT WITH TRUCKS ACROSS MOUNTAINS BUT WITH ROCKETS TO OUR CIVILIZATION IN SPACE TO REFUEL
HOW ABOUT THE MID 2020S
WE HAVE RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES WE CAN RECYCLE WE CAN DECREASE OUR POPULATION GROWTH WE CAN EVEN GET RID OF OUR
IT IS ALSO NOT AN ECONOMICAL PROPOSITION
IN FACT THE PROCESS HAS ALREADY STARTED
NOT ONLY THAT
MY MOTHER WORKED EXTREMELY HARD THROUGH OUR CHILDHOOD TO PROVIDE FOR HER FIVE CHILDREN BUT IT WASN'T EVER A WALK IN THE PARK
AND THEY WOULD JUST LAUGH AT ME THEY JUST CALLED ME STUPID
MY MOTHER TOOK MYSELF AND MY FOUR OTHER SIBLINGS TO THE NETHERLANDS WHERE WE WERE REUNITED WITH MY DAD WHO HAD ALREADY
I WAS ALWAYS THE PERSON TO SAY OH VEGETARIANS ARE WAY TOO PICKY
SO LEAD BY YOUR OWN EXAMPLE AND INSPIRE ONE ANOTHER
WELL I'VE GOT THIS FRIEND CALLED TOM HE'S A CHEF AT A PUB IN LONDON WHERE
SO YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING WHY I'M ASKING YOU THESE QUESTIONS
SOMEBODY WHO'S ALWAYS INSPIRED ME MY ENTIRE LIFE IS MY MOTHER
SHE HAD SO MANY THINGS THAT WERE SO DIFFICULT FOR HER BUT NO MATTER HOW MANY COUNTRIES WE HAD TO MOVE NO MATTER HOW MANY
THIS IS WHERE I NOW CALL HOME
THAT'S TEN BILLION PEOPLE WHO ALL DESERVE FOOD WATER AND SHELTER
TEN BILLION PEOPLE WHO EVEN THE SMARTEST OF MINDS HAVEN'T REALLY FIGURED OUT EXACTLY HOW WE ARE GOING TO FEED THOSE PEOPLE
WHEN I WAS SIX WE FINALLY MANAGED TO SCRAPE TOGETHER ENOUGH MONEY FOR THAT
AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S FAIR
AND NO HIV IS ABSOLUTELY NOT JUST A GAY PROBLEM
BECAUSE WE SHOULD BREAK PAST THIS STIGMA BEHIND TESTING AND WE SHOULD JUST GO AND DO IT
I WILL NOT GET HIV
OH I'M NOT PROMISCUOUS I DON'T NEED TO USE A CONDOM
AM I GOING TO DIE
AT THAT ONE MOMENT I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK
BUT NO EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US CONTRIBUTES TO THIS OVERALL STORY AND HOW WE TALK ABOUT HIV AND HOW WE REACT
I WAS TERRIFIED
I'VE BEEN DOING OUTREACH AT UBC FOR ABOUT 6 MONTHS NOW AND I GET ASKED SOME COMMON QUESTIONS HERE BY UBC
CAN I TELL MY PARENTS
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO IDENTIFY THEM AND TO MOVE PAST THEM BECAUSE NO YOU CANNOT GET HIV FROM A TOILET SEAT
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE OK
I HAVE A FRIEND
AND STEVE SAID
IT COULD MEAN THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO FIND OUT
IT COULD MEAN THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO THINK ABOUT HIV AND HOW IT AFFECTS US
ALL THESE THOUGHTS MUST BE RACING THROUGH YOUR HEAD
IN BC WITH A POPULATION OF 4
I DON'T NEED TO GET TESTED
BUT I'M GOING TO ARGUE THAT WHILE HIV IS LIFE CHANGING IT IS NOT LIFE DEFINING
AND STEVE IS HIV POSITIVE
ONCE AGAIN THE LANGUAGE DEFINES HOW WE THINK ABOUT HIV
BUT NO HIV AFFECTS PEOPLE WE KNOW
AND THAT'S WHY WE MIGHT BE USED TO SAYING THINGS LIKE THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE HIV AS IF SOMEHOW
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT
AND I DON'T BELIEVE IN THIS OTHERING
4 MILLION PEOPLE ARE HIV POSITIVE
WHAT FOOD CAN WE EAT
AND WE SEE THIS ALL AROUND US
THEN YOU DECIDE YOU WOULDN'T MIND A FEW MORE
AND SO WHAT WE WANT TO DO NOW IS TO PREPARE FOR THAT FUTURE BY DEVELOPING TOOLS AND ATTITUDES THAT
WHY IS THIS SO DIFFERENT FOR PEOPLE
WE'VE MET CHAMPIONS ALL OVER THE PUBLIC SECTOR KEEN TO MAKE THESE KINDS OF DIFFERENCES
AND I FELT LIKE SAYING TO HIM BUT I DIDN'T SAY I FELT LIKE SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT
AND WHEN THE GIRLS STARTED ENGAGING HIM HE WAS VERY HOSTILE TOWARDS THEM
AND ALL DAY SHE WALKED AROUND ONLY IN HER UNDERWEAR
WHEN I ASKED WHO IS THAT
THIS IS THE DREAM OF THE AFRICAN GIRL
LET'S DO IT
ONE OF MY GREATEST PLEASURES IN LIFE IS I HAVE TO ADMIT A BIT SPECIAL
I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MUCH I ENJOY WATCHING CITIES FROM THE SKY FROM AN AIRPLANE
BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR TRAFFIC IS FOCUSED ON THE GROUND ON THE SURFACE
YOU WITH YOUR SHINY SKIN AND YOUR BIKE YOU'RE ANGRY AT ME
A RECENT REPORT BY THE PEW CENTER ON TRENDS IN AMERICA INDICATES THAT
YOU CAN LISTEN TO A PODCAST ABOUT WHAT IT'S LIKE TO GROW UP DALIT IN KOLKATA
QUITE THE CONTRARY
AND THIS MAKES SENSE OF COURSE RIGHT
THIS STATISTIC NOT ONLY SUGGEST THAT MEN ARE EXPERIENCING SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE MEN OF MEN TALK WHERE THE AVERAGE AGE IS MID 40S HAVE SAID IS HOW CAN WE
I WENT TO A UNIVERSITY ON THE WEST COAST OF THE US CALLED WALLA WALLA UNIVERSITY IT'S A SISTER COLLEGE OF MY
WE'RE ACTUALLY NOT DOING THAT WELL ALL ACROSS THE BOARD WITH CANCER
HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH ONE OF THE MOST DEADLY FORMS OF BRAIN CANCER
AND I STARTED LOOKING MORE AND MORE INTO THIS
I DON'T THINK WE QUITE WON THIS WAR YET AND I DON'T THINK ANYONE HERE WILL QUESTION THAT
AND ALL YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS PATIENT IS THAT THERE'S A TUMOR ABOUT THE SIZE OF A GOLF BALL OR SO IN THE RIGHT FRONTAL LOBE OF THIS
AND THAT'S MORE OR LESS IT
IT'S NOT JUST THE BEST DOCTORS COULD OFFER PATIENTS WITH BRAIN CANCER GENERALLY
A LOT OF THINGS ARE GOING THROUGH YOUR HEAD
FOR ME IT WAS MOSTLY OUTRAGE
I WAS JUST OUTRAGED THAT HOW COME THIS IS THE BEST THAT WE CAN OFFER
I REALLY WANT TO HELP A LOT OF PEOPLE
SECONDLY WE SHOULD HAVE A MORE NURTURING ENVIRONMENT FOR WOMEN TO LEARN IN THE TECH INDUSTRY BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THERE IS A LOT OF SEXISM
PEOPLE WERE FREAKING OUT
HOW CAN WE GET A WORLD WHERE 50 OF ALL CODING JOBS ARE HELD BY WOMEN INSTEAD OF ONLY 27
SO I WORKED MY WAY INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE CROWD AND LYING THERE FOR EVERYONE TO SEE WAS AN UNWRAPPED UNUSED
FIRSTLY WE SHOULD HAVE MORE FEMALE ROLE MODELS WHO CODE BECAUSE BY HAVING MORE FEMALE ROLE MODELS WHO CODE GIRLS CAN SEE
I DIDN'T WANT TO LOOK THE CASHIER IN THE EYE AND I DIDN'T WANT ANYONE TO SEE ME WITH THE BOX ON MY WAY HOME FROM THE STORE
SO I FORCED MY MOM TO GO AND DO IT FOR ME
A BUNCH OF MY GRADEMATES AND CLASSMATES WERE CIRCLED AROUND THIS ONE THING AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS BUT I REALLY WANTED TO FIND OUT
AND IT'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF FUN GOING TO BE CHEEKY IT'S DEFINITELY GOING TO GET MUCKY BECAUSE TO GET TO SEXY WE HAVE
AND THEN YOU LEARN TO BE ADORED NOT AS AN OBJECT TO BE SEXUALIZED BUT AS A
ONCE UPON A TIME ACCORDING TO MYTH AND LEGEND WE REVELED IN OUR GODDESTRY AND OUR DIVINE
THEY HADN'T FOUND THE SAUCE YET
IN ONE OF THESE EXPERIMENTS WE RECRUITED LIBERALS AND CONSERVATIVES TO A STUDY WHERE THEY READ ONE OF
THEY INCREASINGLY WALL THEMSELVES OFF IN THESE IDEOLOGICAL SILOS CONSUMING DIFFERENT
59 PERCENT OF THEM MADE ARGUMENTS IN TERMS OF ONE OF THE MORE CONSERVATIVE MORAL VALUES AND JUST EIGHT PERCENT
THEY DON'T WANT TO BEFRIEND ONE ANOTHER
THEY DON'T WANT TO DATE ONE ANOTHER
IF THEY DO IF THEY FIND OUT THEY FIND EACH OTHER LESS ATTRACTIVE AND THEY MORE AND MORE DON'T
AND WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE REMOVED THAT SECRECY
FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO MOVE FORWARD TOWARDS TRANSPARENCY
IT'S TIME TO MOVE FORWARD
AND WHEN I STARTED DESIGNING I DISCOVERED AN ODD THING ABOUT MYSELF
THEY'RE NOT AS TRUE AS THEY COULD BE
HOW MUCH OF THIS DIAGRAM DO YOU THINK MIGHT BE TAKEN UP BY THE DEBT THAT AFRICA OWES TO THE WEST
BUT WHAT I LOVE AND I'M A JOURNALIST AND WHAT I LOVE IS FINDING HIDDEN PATTERNS I LOVE BEING A DATA DETECTIVE
AND I'VE NEVER BEEN TO DESIGN SCHOOL
RIGHT NOW THEY DON'T AND IT WOULD BE GREAT TO FIND A WAY TO BETTER COMMUNICATE IT BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT
SOME PEOPLE DON'T
NOBODY THINKS IT IS
ALL OF THIS IS MEASURABLE AND COULD BE IN THE NEW GOALS
SHOULD THOSE BE IN THE NEW PACKAGE OF GOALS
OFTEN THEY'RE NOT IN THE RIGHT PLACE
AND HOW CAN WE DO THAT TOGETHER
OR RUNNING A MARATHON
I AM ONE OF THEM
OWNING A SPORTS CAR
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO FACE REDUNDANCY
ESPECIALLY IN TODAY'S ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
FOR THE MARKETS TO BOUNCE BACK
FOR PEOPLE TO LIVE THE LIFE THEY WANT
SHE GOES WHAT ABOUT DOGS
WOULD THAT EVER HAPPEN
AND THEN THEY BECOME TADPOLES AND FROGS
I DIDN'T KNOW IT WOULD HAPPEN SO QUICK AT EIGHT
LIKE HOW DO THEY KNOW THAT'S THE TIME
HUMANS ARE SO PRIVATE
I'D STUDIED THOUSANDS OF HOURS OF PHYSICS BIOLOGY CHEMISTRY BUT NOT ONE HOUR NOT ONE CONCEPT
THAT'S WHY YOUR SCHEMAS HAD BETTER MATCH REALITY
THAT'S THE BEAUTIFUL THING ABOUT SCIENCE
WE'LL SEE TWO CELLS IN THE UPPER PART OF THE SCREEN
THERE'S NOW A NEW RESEARCH PROJECT UNDERWAY AT THE KAROLINSKA IN SWEDEN TO PROVE THAT HYPOTHESIS
THEY FLOAT FREELY IN THREE DIMENSIONS WITHOUT ANY FORCES ACTING ON THEM
AND AS THEY LAND THEY'RE FULLY ALIGNED IN THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE ALL IN YOUR CHAIRS
THEY FELT EMPOWERED
RESEARCHERS AT USC HAVE FOUND THEY'RE STUDYING TEENAGERS WHO ARE ON SOCIAL MEDIA WHILE THEY'RE TALKING TO THEIR
IT WAS CALLED DELETE THAT APP
AND THERE COULD BE CONSEQUENCES
BUT MY MISERY HAD GOOD COMPANY
SO OUR BODY IT GOES ON AUTOPILOT WHILE WE'RE FOLDING THE LAUNDRY OR WE'RE WALKING TO WORK
THAT PART WAS GREAT
AND THEY TOLD ME THE REASON THEY WERE DOING IT WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE WORRIED THAT THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR PHONE HAD GROWN
IT'S BEETHOVEN HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT
SO YEAH I GET IT WITH LIKE THE WEIRD APPLIANCES AND THEN THE TOTAL ABSENCE OF
NO NO I DIDN'T WRITE THAT
OF A PIECE OF MUSIC RIGHT
IT'S GOING TO BE A KIND OF A REFRAIN AS WE GO THROUGH THE PRESENTATION
THE LESS I LIKED MATH AND SCIENCE THE MORE I LIKED HISTORY AND LITERATURE
THAT'S THE PROBLEM
AND THAT THERE'S A NECESSITY TO BE GOOD AT THOSE TO BE SMART
AND THE WORST
SHE'S AN INSPIRATION
AND LOOK WE ALL DO IT
THE UNCONSCIOUS BIAS IS THERE BUT WE JUST HAVE TO LOOK AT HOW WE CAN MOVE PAST IT
AND IF WE WANT TO CREATE A WORLD WHERE THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF YOUR BIRTH DON'T MATTER WE ALL HAVE TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION
UNHAPPINESS IS THE FRONT DOOR
UNHAPPINESS IS THE DOORWAY
I'VE SEEN DOZENS OF ORGANIZATIONS AND HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE SEEK HAPPINESS OR TRY TO MAINTAIN THEIR INTEGRITY
I CAN NEVER REMEMBER RIGHT
HAPPINESS AND INTEGRITY THEY CAN'T BE REACHED BY WALKING AWAY FROM UNHAPPINESS
WE TURN THAT FROWN UPSIDE DOWN
DIAGNOSING UNHAPPINESS ISN'T HARD
THAT'S WHAT THE PAIN IS FOR
I'M OPTIMISTIC WE CAN
AND WE HAVE THE TALENT TO MAKE IT A REALITY
SO THIS LED TO MY CURIOSITY AROUND SEX DIFFERENCES IN SCHIZOPHRENIA
TOM AND I AGREED THAT WE WANT TO STIMULATE THE OESTROGEN RECEPTOR
THE OBVIOUS DIFFERENCE
MALES TEND TO GET SCHIZOPHRENIA EARLIER ON IN LIFE BE MORE TREATMENT RESISTANT AND HAVE MORE SEVERE
I FINALLY FIGURED OUT HOW THE OESTROGEN RECEPTOR WAS BROKEN WHAT A
IT'S OUR FAMILY'S TRADITION TO GO AROUND THE TABLE BEFORE WE EAT AND SAY WHAT WE ARE THANKFUL FOR
TOM AND I WROTE OUR FIRST FEDERAL GRANT AND OUR CLINICAL TRIAL WAS BORN
AND I IMAGINED HIM BEING ABLE TO PURSUE HIS INTEREST IN MATH AND ENGINEERING
HE WAS A MALE AND I WAS A FEMALE
WHAT CLUES DID I HAVE THAT GUIDED ME IN MY QUEST
WE ENJOYED SCHOOL BUT WE ENJOYED VACATIONS MORE
SCOTT WAS A NORMAL KID VERY BRIGHT IN FACT A BOY GENIUS
TO BE MY AUTHENTIC SELF AND TO JUST HAVE MY FAMILY BE PROUD OF ME
AND IT BECAME CLEAR VERY QUICKLY THAT THE SAME FORCES THE SAME FORCES THAT SAID TO ME
NO YOU'RE NOT A WOMAN THOSE ARE THE SAME FORCES THAT SAY THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO LOVE ONLY ONE WAY TO LIVE
THEY ARE ALL SUPPLIED WITH PLENTY OF WATER
SO IF SOMEONE LOOKS AT THAT YOU'D THINK BRILLIANT
AND FIVE PERCENT OF THEM HAVE FOUND SOMETHING ONLINE THEY DID NOT WANT TO SEE
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO PORTRAY TO PEOPLE
THEY ARE LIKE A BIG GIANT YARN SHOP FOR ANONYMITY
YOU'RE CREATING SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL AND COMPLEX LIKE THIS DALE CHIHULY GLASS SCULPTURE
I RECOGNIZE THAT PERSON AS MYSELF
I TOTALLY LOVE THESE THINGS
SOME OF THOSE THINGS ARE REALLY VISIBLE AND SOME OF THEM ARE REALLY INVISIBLE
YOUR PARENTS MIGHT BE ON FACEBOOK
THEY ARE CREATIVE FANTASTIC TOOLS
IT CAN BE REALLY FANTASTIC TO BUILD UP YOUR NETWORK
WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT YOU
AND THAT'S KIND OF INTERESTING
SO YOU CAN PRESENT YOURSELF IN SORT OF ON STAGE WAYS AND OFF STAGE WAYS
THIS IS MY CAT GODFREY
IS THAT HISTORY OF YOU
BUT INTERESTING AND COMPLEX AND A BRILLIANT PRESENTATION OF YOU THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU THINK
IS IT WHAT YOU WANT IT TO
IT MIGHT BE SILLY
SOME OF THAT I'M PLEASED ABOUT ARE SOME OF THIS I REALLY MISSED
WHAT DO GOATS EAT
SO I SAID YES WITH TWO CAVEATS
HE LEFT AND WE DIDN'T SEE HIM FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS
WE RECENTLY BROUGHT IN AN EXHIBIT FROM THE HOLOCAUST MUSEUM THAT WAS FIGHTING THE
OR DO I SHOW MERCY
AND THEN I REMEMBERED JONESTOWN
CONROY WAS INDIGNANT
BUT ONE YEAR THEY LOST THE CONTRACT
AND SO I WANT TO FOLLOW MY OWN DARN ADVICE
WE'RE ELECTING REGULATORS WHO DON'T HAVE THE BACKBONE TO ACTUALLY GO AFTER THESE COMPANIES
I KNOW AT LEAST A BIT LARRY PAGE FOR EXAMPLE JEFF BEZOS I DON'T ACTUALLY BELIEVE THEY WAKE UP
WE ARE ISSUING 25 CENT PARKING TICKETS ON A METER THAT COSTS 100
WHOSE FAULT IS IT
6 PERCENT WOULDN'T HE DO IT
I BELIEVE IT'S BECAUSE THE RATIO OF ONE PERCENT PURSUIT OF SHAREHOLDER VALUE AND 99 PERCENT THE BETTERMENT OF
IT SHOULDN'T BE THE IPHONE X IT SHOULD BE CALLED THE IPHONE CROSS
YOU'RE A MEDIA COMPANY
THEY'RE SO NICE REMEMBER MICROSOFT
IT'S OUR FAULT
NUMBER TWO IS LIFESTYLE
WHY CHOOSY MOMS CHOOSE JIF YOU LOVE YOUR KIDS MORE
NUMBERS TWO AND THREE H AMP M AND INDITEX
DATA EXCLUSIVITY AND SO ON
A LOT OF THE MONEY THAT PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES MAKE GOES INTO ADVERTISING CAMPAIGNS TRYING TO WIN FAVOR
YOU PAY WITH ONE HAND THROUGH THE TAX SYSTEM BUT YOU GET SOMETHING BACK WITH THE OTHER HAND BECAUSE YOU
THAT'S IN STARK CONTRAST TO THE EXISTING SYSTEM WHERE YOU GET A LOT OF MONEY FOR SWITCHING SOMEBODY FROM
A LOT OF MONEY GOES TO TAKE OUR PATENTS INTO ALL THE DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS
THEY WOULD BE REPLACED
NOW IF YOU TAKE THAT REWARD FROM THE HEALTH IMPACT FUND YOU CAN'T CLAIM THE OTHER REWARD
THAT'S HOW THEY MAKE THEIR MONEY
THAT REPEATS FOR TEN YEARS AND AT THE END OF THE TEN YEARS YOUR PRODUCT GOES GENERIC SO YOU
A LOT OF MONEY GOES FOR GAMING WHERE BRAND NAME COMPANIES PAY GENERIC COMPANIES TO DELAY
AND THEN THERE IS COUNTERFEITING IN THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
DEADWEIGHT LOSSES I WON'T EVEN TELL YOU WHAT THEY ARE BECAUSE IT'S TOO COMPLICATED
SO THE RATE WILL ALWAYS BE AT A REASONABLE LEVEL
PEOPLE SAY PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES MAKE A LOT OF PROFIT
A LOT OF THE DRUGS THERE OFTEN MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT OF WHAT'S SOLD ARE COUNTERFEIT DRUGS WHERE PEOPLE SAY BECAUSE THE
THE POTENTIAL GAINS HERE ARE ENORMOUS
SO WHAT CAN WE DO
AND WITH EACH PARTICULAR MEDICINE THEY HAVE THEIR CHOICE
YOU ALL KNOW HOW EXIT POLLING WORKS AND THIS IS A SIMILAR METHOD
TODAY MOST PACKAGED INSERTS ARE NOT EVEN TRANSLATED INTO LOCAL LANGUAGES AND SO IT'S NOT
AND THESE MARKETING BATTLES OF COURSE ARE A PURE WASTE BECAUSE WHAT ONE COMPANY SPENDS TO GET PATIENTS OVER TO THEIR DRUG ANOTHER
MONEY GOES EVEN LARGER AMOUNTS NBSP FOR LITIGATION
THIS IS NOT JUST FOR POOR PEOPLE
THEY HAVE A CHOICE
SO SOME PEOPLE BEFORE THE MEDICINE CAME ALONG HAD NO TREATMENT AT ALL NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME THEY HAVE TREATMENT BECAUSE
THROUGH MARK UPS
IF WE DID IT ALL OVER AGAIN HOW WOULD YOU DO IT
WE WANT THEM TO AIM FOR THE GREATEST HEALTH IMPACT
NOW HOW WOULD THE FINANCING WORK
AND VICE VERSA
THE HEALTH IMPACT FUND DOES NOT PAY FOR THAT
HOW CAN WE CHANGE THE SYSTEM
AND THE REASON THEY INTERACTED DIFFERENTLY WAS BECAUSE OF THE DESIGN AND THE TOOLS THAT WERE GIVEN TO THEM
COUNTY MUSEUM OF ART
WE ARE GOING TO EMBRACE IT
THIS IS FROM THE L
SO AGAIN AT OUR MUSEUM WE THINK REALLY CAREFULLY ABOUT HOW TO BRING TO LIFE THE CONVERSATIONS THAT CAN HAPPEN
THEY DID THIS PROJECT A COUPLE YEARS AGO WHERE THEY ASKED PEOPLE A QUESTION ABOUT ART
THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO IS GOING TO GET MORE INVOLVED
THE SAME PEOPLE DID BOTH OF THESE ACTIVITIES
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A PROFESSIONAL TO BE EXCITED ABOUT CULTURE TODAY
THEY'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT THE THINGS THAT WE PROTECT AND YET WEREN'T STAYING AT ARM'S LENGTH
WHAT IS THAT ABOUT
WHY STUDY ANCIENT MOLECULES
HOW DID IT INCREASE IN COMPLEXITY AND WHAT WERE THE TRIGGERS FOR THIS
THEY HAVE THE BEST FOOD PROCESSING ABILITIES EVER
BUT WHAT ABOUT MY OWN SPECIALITY
I WORKED EVERY WEEKEND
I WAS THAT GUY WHO IF I EVER SAID YES TO BEING INVITED OUT TO SOME SOCIAL FUNCTION WAS IN THE CORNER ON HIS
I BELIEVE WE CAN FUNDAMENTALLY REVERSE TRENDS IN LONELINESS AND AS A RESULT OF THAT CHANGE
THE MOST RECENT ESTIMATES OF THE TRANSGENDER POPULATION ARE 0
IF YOU HAD TO GO HOME EVERY TIME YOU HAD TO USE THE BATHROOM HOW FAR COULD YOU REALLY GO AND WHAT LIFE
SINCE THEY WERE BOTH THE SAME I CHOSE THE DOOR ON THE RIGHT
THE WAY YOU EXPRESS YOURS WILL BE DIFFERENT THAN THE WAY OTHERS EXPRESS THEIRS
4 MILLION PEOPLE
THE EASIEST THING YOU CAN DO TO STOP THE VIOLENCE IN PUBLIC RESTROOMS IS TO BE LIKE THE MEN IN THE WALMART
EIGHT PERCENT OF US TRANS PEOPLE SURVEYED SHOWED THAT THEY HAD KIDNEY OR URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS OR OTHER KIDNEY RELATED
MANY TRANSGENDER PEOPLE DO THEIR BEST TO AVOID PUBLIC RESTROOMS ENTIRELY BECAUSE OF THE FREQUENT INCONSISTENT TROUBLE THEY
DON'T POINT OR STARE DON'T TELL PEOPLE THEY'RE IN THE WRONG PLACE
THEY HAD TO WAIT LINE A WHILE BUT EVENTUALLY GOT IN AND OUT
SO IF I DON'T HAVE A REASON TO BE AFRAID IN A PUBLIC RESTROOM WHO DOES
A CUSTOMER HAD TO INTERVENE TO STOP WHAT WAS HAPPENING
BUT AS TRANSGENDER PEOPLE GROW THEIR GENDER IDENTITY DOES NOT TURN OUT THE WAY THEIR DOCTOR EXPECTED
WOMEN WERE ENTERING THE WORKPLACE FOR THE FIRST TIME AND SEPARATE RESTROOMS WERE SOCIETY'S RESPONSE TO A RAPIDLY
SEGREGATION HAS SPREAD FEAR THROUGHOUT AN ALREADY TENSE WHITE POPULATION THAT IF BLACKS WERE ALLOWED TO USE PUBLIC
THE POLITICS OF PUBLIC RESTROOMS HAVE A NEW TARGET NOW
MAYBE YOU'VE GOT AN INTERNSHIP
A KID OF 5 OR 65 VOTED IN THE SAME WAY
SOME EXPERT I WAS ON LEADERSHIP
I KNEW NOTHING
STANDS FOR SOMETHING
WHICH IS CRAZY RIGHT
AND ACTUALLY IT'S THIS SPREAD THAT COUNTS
BUT THEN IMAGINE THE NEXT PERSON TO COME ALONG IS JUST MARGINALLY LESS BORING DULL AND
BUT I THINK THAT IT'S QUITE INTERESTING TO KNOW THAT THERE IS REALLY MATHEMATICAL EVIDENCE TO SAY THAT YOU SHOULD
SO WHAT THAT MEANS THEN IS THAT IF SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT YOU'RE ATTRACTIVE YOU'RE ACTUALLY BETTER OFF
NOW YOU CAN BE FORGIVEN PERHAPS FOR THINKING THAT THE ARGUMENTS THAT PRECEDE A MARITAL BREAKUP ARE NOT
BECAUSE FOR ME EQUATIONS AND SYMBOLS AREN'T JUST A THING
BUT THE WAY THAT PEOPLE WOULD VOTE WOULD BE VERY DIFFERENT
THANKFULLY THERE'S A RATHER DELICIOUS BIT OF MATHEMATICS THAT WE CAN USE TO HELP US OUT HERE CALLED OPTIMAL
IT'S THIS SPREAD THAT MAKES YOU MORE POPULAR ON AN ONLINE INTERNET DATING WEBSITE
NOW I LIKE TO THINK THAT EVERYBODY WOULD IDEALLY LIKE TO AVOID DIVORCE APART FROM I
BUT EQUALLY YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO LEAVE IT TOO LONG IF YOU WANT TO MAXIMIZE YOUR CHANCE OF LONG TERM HAPPINESS
NOW UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT THIS METHOD DOES COME WITH SOME RISKS
BUT IT'S A SAD FACT OF MODERN LIFE THAT 1 IN 2 MARRIAGES IN THE STATES ENDS IN
FOR ONE THING IT'S VERY HARD TO KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD BE MEASURING OR WHAT YOU SHOULD BE QUANTIFYING
SO I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL
WE GIVE OURSELVES A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO PLAY THE FIELD GET A FEEL FOR THE MARKETPLACE OR WHATEVER WHEN WE'RE
WELL WHY WOULD YOU BOTHER HUMILIATING YOURSELF LET'S BE HONEST
IN MY EXPERIENCE AT LEAST I FIND THAT TYPICALLY PEOPLE DON'T MUCH LIKE BEING RECALLED YEARS AFTER BEING
AND THE RESULTS THAT THEY FOUND I THINK ARE JUST INCREDIBLY IMPRESSIVELY SIMPLE AND INTERESTING
THEY'RE A VOICE THAT SPEAKS OUT ABOUT THE INCREDIBLE RICHNESS OF NATURE AND THE STARTLING
THERE'D BE A HUGE SPREAD IN HER SCORES
BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT MATHEMATICS HASN'T GOT SOMETHING THAT IT CAN OFFER US BECAUSE
AND THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO SEARCH FOR PATTERNS IN THE WAY THAT WE TALK ABOUT OURSELVES AND THE WAY THAT WE INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER ON AN
AND THEY'VE COME UP WITH SOME SERIOUSLY INTERESTING FINDINGS
BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL HE TEAMED UP WITH A MATHEMATICIAN JAMES MURRAY THAT THEY REALLY STARTED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT
DON'T BE SHY
DON'T TAKE ME WRONG
PROBABLY THIS GENERATION HAS SOMETHING TO CONTRIBUTE
IN WHICH WE SUPPORT NONPROFITS AND CAUSES THAT WE LIKE AND THAT WE TALK ABOUT IT AND WE DO IT
WE DO STUFF AND WE TALK ABOUT IT
BUT JUST IN CASE DON'T FORGET THREE ENVELOPES
YES THOSE ARE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS
AND THAT IS WHAT WE NEED TO CHANGE
AND ALSO BECAUSE OUR LEGAL FRAMEWORK ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT FANTASTIC IT'S ALSO NOT TERRIBLE
OR MAYBE YOUR MIND WAS JUST ENTIRELY ELSEWHERE
NOW WE WANTED TO SEE IF WE COULD ACTUALLY RECORD THIS ON THE TRACK SO WE HEADED DOWN SOUTH TO LAGUNA SECA
BUT IN FACT THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE'VE DEVELOPED IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING THESE AUTONOMOUS CARS
NOW WE CAN MEASURE THIS AND WE CAN LOOK AT THE RELATIVE POWER BETWEEN THE THETA WAVES AND THE ALPHA WAVES
I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU AROUND NOW TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TRACK
NOW THE CORKSCREW IS A CHICANE FOLLOWED BY A QUICK RIGHT HANDED TURN AS THE ROAD DROPS THREE STORIES
AND JOHN'S GOING TO GO INTO THAT CORNER AND THE REAR END OF THE CAR IS GOING TO BEGIN TO SLIDE OUT
THEY'RE ABLE TO GO OUT AND CONSISTENTLY DO THIS PUSHING THE CAR TO THE LIMITS EVERY SINGLE
YOU SEE WE'VE BEEN DEVELOPING ROBOTIC RACE CARS CARS THAT CAN ACTUALLY PUSH THEMSELVES TO THE
WELL THERE'S TWO REALLY GOOD REASONS FOR THIS
YOU WERE TIRED BUT YOU FELT YOU COULD DRIVE A FEW MORE MILES
UNCOVER WHAT I'D HINT AT IF I COULD
THIS WAS A BRAIN THAT PAID ITS DUES
SO WHEN THIS SIGNAL IS NOT ADEQUATELY BEING PROVIDED TO THE BRAIN YOU AUTOMATICALLY EAT MORE
BUT THAT WILL ALSO INCREASE YOUR APPETITE
IT IS NOW TIME TO NOT LONGER JUDGE PEOPLE WITH OBESITY BUT TO START
BUT IT HAS BEEN DISCOVERED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THAT AS ADULTS WE ALSO HAVE BROWN FAT
AND THAT'S EVEN SO IN THE LONG TERM
THEY HAVE A GOOD CHANCE OF HAVING A LOT OF BROWN FAT THERE
IT IS LEADING TO DISEASES LIKE DIABETES HEART DISEASE SOME FORMS OF CANCER
WE ALL KNOW THE WHITE FAT THAT'S WHAT'S ON YOUR HIPS AND YOUR BELLY AND THAT'S UNHEALTHY FAT WHICH IS MAKING YOU SICK
SO BASICALLY AFTER A CRASH DIET YOU ARE HUNGRIER
SO THE SOLUTION HERE FOR OBESITY ADDITIONAL SOLUTIONS MAY BE TO REDUCE YOUR STRESS LEVEL
BUT THERE ARE OTHER FACTORS IN OUR ENVIRONMENT WHICH AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF FOOD WE EAT
YOUR BIOLOGY IS DRIVEN BY YOUR THINKING
SHE GAINED ACTUALLY A LOT OF WEIGHT 20 POUNDS WITHIN TEN WEEKS AND SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHY
AND REMEMBER YOUR STRESS HORMONES INCREASE YOUR ABDOMINAL FAT
AND THEN TO DISCUSS WHETHER THE DOSE CAN BE REDUCED OR THE MEDICATION CAN MAYBE EVEN STOPPED TO MAKE
BUT ACTUALLY ALREADY IS ENOUGH IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT IF YOU SPEND FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS
IN PARTICULAR THE STRESS HORMONE CORTISOL IF YOU ARE STRESSED FOR A PROLONGED PERIOD OF TIME
WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S CAUSING WHAT ACTUALLY BECAUSE THIS SUGAR RICH FOOD SEEM ALSO TO
THE BIOLOGY IS TELLING YOU TO EAT MORE
THE REASONS ARE SIMPLE
AND THAT'S THE WAY WE WILL COMBAT OBESITY MUCH MORE EFFECTIVELY
BUT STILL PARTICULARLY OBESE PEOPLE USE MORE MEDICATION
CURRENTLY MEDICAL TREATMENTS ARE UNDER DEVELOPMENT FOR PATIENTS LIKE JOHN SO I HOPE TO BEING ABLE TO HELP HIM
AT THAT POINT HIS MOTHER PUT LOCKS ON ALL THE KITCHEN CUPBOARDS BUT STILL HE WAS CRAVING
SHE GOT FRUSTRATED
ABDOMINAL FAT MASS WILL INCREASE
AND AT SOME POINT SHE GET REFERRED TO THE ERASMUS MEDICAL CENTER IN ROTTERDAM
YOU CAN DO IT EITHER BY EXERCISE WHICH IS HARD IF YOU ARE REALLY MASSIVELY OBESE BUT YOU CAN
AND ACTUALLY THIS IS RARE
WE IMPLANTED ELECTRODES IN THE FORNIX OF PATIENTS WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE WE TURNED IT ON AND WE LOOKED AT WHAT HAPPENS TO
BUT THIS WAS COMMON
WE WANT YOU TO STOP DOING THAT
AND WE DO THAT WITH ELECTRICITY
BUT I SAY WE SHOULD NOT BE AFRAID OF USING OUR FEELINGS TO IMPLEMENT AND TO CATALYZE FACT BASED
SPOCK IS HALF HUMAN AND HALF VULCAN AND VULCANS ARE AN ALIEN RACE
THEY COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER AND THEY REINFORCE EACH OTHER
TO TRAVEL OUT TO FIND SPOCK
WE TEND TO THINK THAT SCIENCE IS ALL ABOUT FACTS AND LOGIC AND HUMAN FEELINGS ARE OFTEN
I WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT EMOTIONS ARE AS IMPORTANT IN SCIENCE AS THEY ARE IN ANY OTHER PART OF OUR
ROBERT GOVERS AND I HAVE SPENT THE BEST PART OF THE LAST TWO YEARS WITH THE HELP OF A LARGE NUMBER OF VERY SERIOUS AND CLEVER PEOPLE
WHY DID I DO THIS
OH SURE WE'RE VERY GOOD AT EMPATHY WHEN IT'S A QUESTION OF DEALING WITH PEOPLE WHO KIND OF LOOK LIKE US AND KIND OF WALK AND
I SWEAR THAT AS I GET OLDER MY IDEAS BECOME SIMPLER AND MORE AND MORE CHILDISH
SO MY COLLEAGUE DR
ONCE SOMEONE'S BEEN DEEMED A VICTIM IT'S THAT MUCH EASIER TO FILE THEM AWAY AS SOMEONE
AND THIS MARKED THE START OF AN EIGHT YEAR LONG CORRESPONDENCE THAT GOD KNOWS WAS
AND THIS WAS ABOUT ANALYZING OUR OWN HISTORY
HOW CAN WE DISCUSS SOLUTIONS TO ONE OF THE BIGGEST THREATS TO THE LIVES OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN AROUND THE
AND AS A RESULT I'VE BEEN READING WRITING AND SPEAKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE FOR OVER A DECADE NOW GOING TO
BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THAT WAY
I RELIEVED MYSELF OF THE BURDENS THAT I'D WRONGFULLY SHOULDERED AND HE IN TURN WHOLEHEARTEDLY OWNED UP TO
OUR WRITTEN EXCHANGES BECAME A PLATFORM TO DISSECT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT NIGHT AND THEY WERE EVERYTHING
AT TIMES OUR SEARCH FOR UNDERSTANDING IN CAPE TOWN FELT LIKE AN IMPOSSIBLE QUEST AND ALL I
DESPITE LIMPING FOR DAYS AND CRYING FOR WEEKS THIS INCIDENT DIDN'T FIT MY IDEAS ABOUT RAPE
ONE DAY I STORMED OUT OF THE DOOR IN TEARS AFTER A FIGHT WITH A LOVED ONE AND I WANDERED INTO A CAF
BECAUSE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT HE DESERVED MY FORGIVENESS I DESERVED
WHEN THE DIRECTOR SAW THAT DRAWING HE THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT
WHEN THEY DON'T WORK SOMEONE OR SOMETHING IS TO BLAME
WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE DISRUPTORS ALL THE MINORITY VOICES IN THIS ORGANIZATION SPEAK UP
FOR SURE THERE ARE TIMES WHEN VISIONARY LEADERSHIP IS EXACTLY WHAT IS NEEDED
IT'S A TYPE OF COLLABORATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING USUALLY AMONG PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIFFERENT EXPERTISE AND DIFFERENT
THE HEAD OF THE ENGINEERING GROUP AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE GROUP AT THAT TIME WAS A MAN NAMED BILL COUGHRAN
INSTEAD OF CREATING A GROUP TO TACKLE THIS TASK THEY DECIDED TO ALLOW GROUPS TO EMERGE
I'M NEVER A DICTATOR OF VIEWPOINTS
BUT IF I'M TRYING TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S TRULY NEW I HAVE NO ANSWERS
ON THE CONTRARY IT TAKES ABOUT 250 PEOPLE FOUR TO FIVE YEARS TO MAKE ONE OF THOSE
IT'S BECAUSE THEY'VE MASTERED THE CAPABILITIES REQUIRED FOR THAT
BECAUSE THAT ANIMATOR WAS ALLOWED TO SHARE WHAT WE REFERRED TO AS HIS SLICE OF GENIUS HE WAS ABLE
THIS IS ABOUT DOING DECISION MAKING IN A WAY THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY COMBINE EVEN OPPOSING IDEAS TO
PILOTS ARE OFTEN ABOUT BEING RIGHT
THEY WANT TO COCREATE WITH ME THE FUTURE
IT'S ABOUT DISCOVERY DRIVEN LEARNING WHERE YOU ACT AS OPPOSED TO PLAN YOUR WAY TO THE FUTURE
IF WE WANT TO INVENT A BETTER FUTURE AND I SUSPECT THAT'S WHY MANY OF US ARE HERE THEN
WE ENDED UP WITH PAGES AND PAGES AND PAGES OF FIELD NOTES THAT WE ANALYZED AND LOOKED FOR PATTERNS IN WHAT
ONE BECAME KNOWN AS BIG TABLE THE OTHER BECAME KNOWN AS BUILD IT FROM SCRATCH
BILL SAID I LEAD A VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATION
WE STUDIED A GENERAL COUNSEL IN A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY WHO HAD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THE OUTSIDE LAWYERS
HE ADMITTED IF YOU HAD FORCED US TO ALL BE ON ONE TEAM WE MIGHT HAVE FOCUSED ON PROVING WHO WAS RIGHT
ADVICE ABOUT HOW YOU EXERCISE THE ROLE
WHAT DO THEY FOCUS THEIR TIME ON
HOW DID HE SEE HIS ROLE
NOT ON CREATING A VISION
THE FINAL CAPABILITY IS CREATIVE RESOLUTION
BECAUSE WHAT WAS HAPPENING IS THAT EVERYBODY WAS LOOKING UP AND YOU WEREN'T SEEING THE KIND OF BOTTOM UP INNOVATION
INNOVATIVE WORK CAN BE VERY EXHILARATING BUT IT ALSO CAN BE REALLY DOWNRIGHT
THEY ALSO LEARN HOW TO ADVOCATE FOR THEIR POINT OF VIEW
AND FINALLY LET'S BESTOW CREDIT IN A VERY GENEROUS WAY
EARLY IN THAT PROCESS ONE OF THE ENGINEERS HAD GONE TO BILL AND SAID WE'RE ALL TOO BUSY FOR THIS INEFFICIENT
I DON'T KNOW WHAT DIRECTION WE'RE GOING IN AND I'M NOT EVEN SURE I KNOW HOW TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THERE
AND GUESS WHAT
PARTWAY THROUGH ONE PRODUCTION AN ANIMATOR DREW A CHARACTER WITH AN ARCHED EYEBROW THAT SUGGESTED A
IN THE 20 YEARS HENCE THEY'VE PRODUCED 14 MOVIES
WHEN MANY OF US THINK ABOUT INNOVATION THOUGH WE THINK ABOUT AN EINSTEIN HAVING AN AHA
BILL AND HIS LEADERSHIP TEAM WHO HE REFERRED TO AS HIS BRAIN TRUST HAD TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO ABOUT THIS
SO THEY BEGAN TO WORK ON THAT
LET'S PUT IN A POLICY THAT ANYONE NO MATTER WHAT THEIR LEVEL OR ROLE IS ALLOWED TO GIVE NOTES TO THE DIRECTOR ABOUT HOW
LET'S THINK FOR A MINUTE ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE A PIXAR MOVIE NO SOLO GENIUS NO FLASH
A WORLD WHERE YOU'RE LIVING AT THE FRONTIER
WHEN WE MET VINEET HIS COMPANY WAS ABOUT IN HIS WORDS TO BECOME IRRELEVANT
SO THEY SELECTED THAT ONE
BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE ONE TINY SHOW OVER HERE ON AMC AND ONE TINY SHOW OVER HERE OVER THERE FINDING WHERE THEY ARE
AND INSTEAD OF HAVING A SCENE WHERE YOU KNOW HE'S TALKING TO ANOTHER CHARACTER VERY RAPIDLY HE GOES INTO A
I WALKED IN AND I WAS LIKE THAT SCENE WHERE OUR MYSTERY WOMAN STARTS SPEAKING RUSSIAN
I'M NOT SURE IF WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THEM IN TIME
I FIND IT FASCINATING THAT YOU CAN'T REALLY BINGE WATCH YOU CAN'T FAST FORWARD
I THINK OF STORY IN TERMS OF CHARACTER AND WHAT CHARACTERS WOULD DO AND WHAT CHARACTERS NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM MOVE
SO I THINK THE INTERESTING THING THAT HAPPENS IS THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WORLD
AND HOW DO YOU THINK DOES THAT CHANGE THE STORYTELLING PROCESS AT ALL
WE HAVE SOME INTERESTING IDEAS FOR THAT
YOU KNOW IF I'M IN CHARGE OF HOW THE SOPRANOS ENDS THEN THAT'S LOVELY AND I HAVE AN ENDING THAT'S NICE AND SATISFYING BUT IT'S NOT THE SAME
IMAGINE SITTING NEXT TO HIM OR BEING WITH A CHARACTER LIKE HUCK WHO'S ABOUT TO EXECUTE SOMEBODY
I DO THINK THAT THERE ARE GOING TO BE DIFFERENT WAYS BUT I DON'T KNOW
IT'S GETTING A LITTLE BIT DISTURBING
FOR STORYTELLING OTHER THAN BOOKS
WE'RE IN THIS SORT OF WILD WEST PERIOD TO ME IT FEELS LIKE BECAUSE NOBODY KNOWS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SETTLE ON
IT'S A LITTLE MORE LIKE THEATER AND I'M NOT SURE IT WOULD WORK BUT I'M FASCINATING BY THE CONCEPT OF SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN
I THOUGHT THEY WERE FUN
BUT THE IDEA THAT WE WOULD LIVE TWEET OUR SHOW WAS REALLY JUST US THINKING THAT WOULD BE FUN
I MEAN I DIDN'T EVEN IMAGINE TELEVISION
AND THAT WAS ALWAYS GREAT EXCEPT NOW IT FELT LIKE THE WHEELS WERE COMING OFF THE BUS AND THINGS WERE ACTUALLY
BUT FINDING THE GOOD STORIES THE GOOD SHOWS IS HARDER AND HARDER AND HARDER
I JUST THOUGHT THESE ARE THE ACTORS I WANT TO SEE PLAY THESE PARTS
I WANT TO SEE WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE IF THEY READ
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS
I MEAN I GREW UP WANTING TO BE TONI MORRISON SO NO
SO IN YOUR COMPANIES YOU CAN'T KEEP TRACK OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL INVOICE AND SO YOU HAVE TO
I HAD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PUT THOSE ON
AND EVENTUALLY BECOMING PRETTY GOOD AT SOMETHING
ERICSSON WAS ACTUALLY SAYING IS IT TAKES 10000 HOURS TO GET AT THE TOP OF AN ULTRA
IT'S NOT TRUE
SILENCE IS KATRINA
I WILL ASK THAT HOMELESS MAN WHAT HIS NAME IS AND HOW HIS DAY WAS BECAUSE SOMETIMES ALL PEOPLE WANT TO BE IS
I'M ACTUALLY GONNA JUST GO AND SAY I THINK WE SHOULD JUST DO AWAY WITH THE WORD SUSTAINABILITY AS IT RELATES TO HEALTH CARE ALL
WHY WOULD YOU WANT THEM TO HAVE SPLOTCHY COATS
WE HAD THIS EXPLOSION OF TECHNOLOGY
HE HAD THIS OVEN MITT BECAUSE THESE FOXES WERE ESSENTIALLY WILD THEY WOULD BITE IF YOU TRIED TO HOLD THEM SO HE HAD THIS
AND YOU KNOW SHE TOOK IT LIKE A CHAMP
SO IF WOLVES WERE AGGRESSIVE TOWARDS PEOPLE AND THEY WERE LARGER THAN THEY ARE TODAY WE JUST WOULD HAVE KILLED THEM
HE MOVED TO MOSCOW AND BASICALLY TOOK CARE OF DIMITRI SINCE HE WAS IN THE SECOND GRADE ABOUT EIGHT
I MEAN WHEN WE ARRIVED IN EUROPE WE WIPED OUT ALMOST ALL OF THEM EXCEPT FOR WOLVES
AND SO DIMITRI THEN DECIDED TO DO WHAT NOBODY ELSE HAS DONE BEFORE OR SINCE AND HE WAS GOING TO
AND IT TURNS OUT THAT BONOBOS ARE BETTER THAN CHIMPANZEES AT THIS
AND IF I REPHRASE THAT GAME TO YOU AND IF THERE WAS SOMEBODY IF YOU HAD THE CHOICE TO SHARE THE 100 WITH A
SO IT TURNS OUT THAT THESE FOXES THAT DIMITRI HAD DOMESTICATED THEY ALSO
SO ECONOMIC THEORY PREDICTS THAT WE'RE JUST GOING TO KEEP ALL THE MONEY BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHY WOULD YOU GIVE ANY OF IT AWAY
IT WAS NOT THE MOST GENIUS IDEA BUT ALL I COULD COME UP WITH I WAS SO SLEEP DEPRIVED
IS SHE GOING OUTSIDE
SO WE GAVE THEM THIS COOPERATIVE GAME WHERE YOU HAVE TO COOPERATE WITH ANOTHER
I WENT TO THIS TALK BY STEVE CHURCHILL WHO IS THE WORLD'S EXPERT ON NEANDERTHALS AND HE PUTS
THIS IS SERIOUSLY IMPRESSIVE BECAUSE IN ORDER TO DO THIS YOUR DOG HAS TO UNDERSTAND THAT
SO ONLY THE SUPER FRIENDLY WOLVES WOULD HAVE SURVIVED
WELL HOW DID THEY GET THIS WAY
IT'S SO WONDERFUL TO BE HERE
WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES US HUMAN
I MARRIED A NEANDERTHAL
THIS IS BY OUR DEAR FRIEND MARK STEWART
HE WAS WITH CHRONIC DIARRHEA
AND WE ARE FIGHTING THE WRONG FIGHT
THERE'S NOTHING GOING
WE NEED TO CHANGE
AND IT WILL BE THE SAME THING FOR MANY OF OUR KIDS THAT WE ARE HELPING
AND BY THE TIME HE WAS A TODDLER IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HANDLE
IT'S CALLED UNIVERSITY
THAT'S THE STORY
WE KNOW HOW TO KEEP THEM HEALTHY
AND THEY'LL GET BETTER
THERE'S NO ACTIVITY
NOW I'LL SHARE WITH YOU WHAT WE HAD TO DO ABOUT IT
WE NEED TO CHANGE THE MINDS OF THE MEDICAL INSURANCES OUT THERE
WE WILL IN FACT
WE ARE ADVERTISING AUTISM
THERE'S NO BLOOD FLOW GOING THROUGH THIS PART OF THE BRAIN
AND THERE'S NO COMMUNICATION
THEY DON'T HAVE A PSYCHIATRIC CONDITION
IT WAS THE SAME THING FOR HIM
AND THAT HAPPENED TO US
HE WAS BORN A BEAUTIFUL BABY BOY
ALLERGIES TO MEDICATION
AND WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO WITH EDDIE
THERE'S MORE WHY THEIR DEADLY SYMBOL OF THE SKULL AND CROSSBONES WAS A PRECURSOR OF TODAY'S
ONCE THERE SHE SWIFTLY REALIZED THAT MORE PATIENTS WERE DYING OF INFECTIONS THAT THEY CAUGHT
THEY WERE ALL YOUNGER THAN ME
AND THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE HIGHLIGHT OF THIS WHOLE THING I TALK ABOUT
BUT COMPLETELY NECESSARY
THEY ONLY HAD ISLAMIC EDUCATION VERY LITTLE OF IT
AND FOR THE MOST PART THE STORIES ARE RECYCLED
IT WAS VENERABLE
I THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE MY FATHER EXCEPT I NOTICED THE CREATURE HAD LONG HAIR
SO WHAT ARE MICROALGAE
IN INDIA ACCORDING TO CUSTOM WHEN A HINDU WOMAN BECOMES A WIDOW ALL SHE'S ALLOWED TO WEAR IS
AND THIS WE CAN SAY WITHOUT A SINGLE WORD
WIDOWS IN INDIA LIKE MY GRANDMOTHER THOUSANDS OF THEM LIVE IN A CITY CALLED VRINDAVAN
NOW WHEN MOST OF US DECIDE TO WEAR A PAIR OF JEANS SOMEPLACE LIKE NEW YORK LONDON MILAN
IT HAS THE POWER TO FILL US WITH JOY THE JOY OF FREEDOM TO CHOOSE FOR OURSELVES
HOWEVER IF I TODAY THEN YOU TOMORROW MAYBE EVEN MORE OF US SOMEDAY IF WE
TWO THOUSAND MILES AWAY IN PESHAWAR PAKISTANI TRANSGENDER ACTIVIST ALISHA WAS SHOT
FASHION CAN GIVE US A LANGUAGE FOR DISSENT
HOWEVER ONLY AS RECENTLY AS 2013 THE WIDOWS OF VRINDAVAN HAVE STARTED TO
HOWEVER HE SOON STARTED RECEIVING DEATH THREATS FOR HOW HE LOOKED
MY GRANDMOTHER WAS A WOMAN WHO TOOK EXTRAORDINARY PLEASURE IN DRESSING UP
I THINK THIS WENT STRAIGHT TO GOD'S VOICEMAIL THOUGH
NO I WAS NOT GOING TO MAGICALLY CHANGE
AND OVER TIME I GREW LESS AND LESS SURE THAT I ACTUALLY WANTED TO
AND SCOTT AGGREGATED ALL OF THE VIDEOS
IT WASN'T A VIRTUAL CHOIR
HE MADE SURE THAT EVERYTHING LINED UP
I SAID THANK YOU SCOTT
HE SCRUBBED THE AUDIO
I ACTUALLY WAS MOVED TO TEARS WHEN I FIRST SAW IT
AND THERE WERE 900 PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THAT
AND BECAUSE OF THAT THEN A LOT OF SINGERS STARTED SAYING ALL RIGHT WHAT'S VIRTUAL CHOIR 2
THIS WILL BE A PREMIERE TODAY
I JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE THE POETRY OF ALL OF IT THESE SOULS ALL ON THEIR OWN DESERT
WE HAD A MILLION HITS IN THE FIRST MONTH AND GOT A LOT OF ATTENTION FOR IT
I'M SO GLAD THAT YOU FOUND ME
IT SOUNDS GREAT
AND I EVEN LOVED SEEING BEHIND HER I COULD SEE THE LITTLE TEDDY BEAR SITTING ON THE PIANO BEHIND HER IN HER ROOM
I'D LIKE TO BE THE PERSON TO EDIT THIS ALL TOGETHER
I LEFT THEM EVERYWHERE IN CAFES AND IN LIBRARIES AT THE U
I AM MERELY A STORYTELLER
FIND ME WHEN YOU CAN
OR A GIRL WHO DECIDES THAT SHE IS GOING TO LEAVE LOVE LETTERS AROUND HER CAMPUS IN DUBUQUE IOWA ONLY TO
AND SOME PEOPLE WILL SAY MAYBE YOU ARE MAKING THE PROBLEM BIGGER THAN IT WAS
BON APP TIT'S ONE OF THE BIG CATERING COMPANIES
SO IN THE PARTS OF THE ISLAND WHERE NOBODY IS USING THEM THOSE ARE THE PARTS OF THE ISLAND WHERE WE ARE GOING TO BE FOCUSING OUR
WE NEED TO BE EMPOWERING PEOPLE TO BE SUCCESSFUL
RED CROSS DIDN'T HAVE THE RIGHT ANSWERS BECAUSE SOUTHERN BAPTIST CHURCH THE BIGGEST FOOD
AT ONE POINT WE GOT 16 OF THE BEST CHEFS THAT AMERICA CAN OFFER
SO I PICKED UP THE PHONE AND I CALLED A COMPANY CALLED BON APP TIT FEDELE
I CANNOT LEAVE YOU ALONE FOR A DAY
THE MEN AND WOMEN ARE SMART THEY ARE PREPARED BUT THEY LIVE UNDER THIS AMAZING HIERARCHY
WHAT WE DID WAS A FLATTER ORGANIZATIONAL CHART WHERE EVERYBODY WAS OWNING THE SITUATION AND
THEY BELONG TO A BIGGER GROUP CALLED COMPASS
I BROUGHT 120 CHICKENS WITH YUCCA AND WITH RICE AND WE WENT BACK TO
WE ARRIVED WITH THE 120 CHICKENS WE DROPPED THE FOOD AND THE COMMUNITY WERE
WHEN YOU SEE THE RED CROSS DELIVERING FOOD IN AMERICA AFTER A HURRICANE IT'S SOUTHERN BAPTIST CHURCH DOING IT
YOU COULDN'T FIND ANYBODY THE MOMENT YOU MOVED AWAY FROM SAN JUAN
I TOLD THEM I WANT 18 KITCHENS AROUND THE ISLAND
WE BEGAN TRYING TO BE SENDING THE MESSAGE WE NEED TO START MOVING AWAY FROM THE PLACES THAT ARE ALREADY
AND BE SURE TO DIVERSIFY
LOOK I HAD THE GRADES TO PROVE IT
SHE IS A GREAT MENTOR
IT'S NOT THE MENTOR AT ALL
SO IT HAD BEEN A HUGE GAMBLE BUT IT HAD PAID OFF
AND WHEN WE COME TOGETHER AND WORK AS ONE WE CAN ACHIEVE EXTRAORDINARY
IN ADDITION I BELIEVE THAT EVERY OILED ANIMAL DESERVES A SECOND CHANCE AT LIFE
IF PENGUINS ARE DYING IT MEANS OUR OCEANS ARE DYING
WHAT COULD ONE PERSON POSSIBLY DO TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE
AND AS A RESULT DURING THE TREASURE RESCUE JUST 160 PENGUINS DIED
WELL YOU SHOULD CARE BECAUSE THEY'RE AN INDICATOR SPECIES
JUST LOOK AT THAT 17 YEAR OLD
THIS IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE ONE YEAR AGO THE AFRICAN PENGUIN WAS
AND SIMPLY PUT
AND THE TWO MAIN THREATS TO PENGUINS TODAY ARE OVERFISHING AND GLOBAL WARMING
AND TRULY TO BE A PART OF SOMETHING SO MUCH LARGER THAN YOURSELF IS THE MOST REWARDING
SO HE RACED TO THE LAB AND MADE ENOUGH TO CLEAN THE REST OF THE BIRDS
WELL SHE COULD NOT BE MORE WRONG
BUT PARTWAY THROUGH THEY RAN OUT
BUT THEN FINALLY ONE OF THE RESEARCHERS THREW OUT THIS CRAZY IDEA
AND WITH THAT CALL MY LIFE WOULD CHANGE FOREVER
WHAT DID IT FEEL LIKE WHEN YOU FIRST WALKED INTO THAT BUILDING AND SAW SO MANY OILED
AND I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING TO HELP BUT I ALWAYS WONDERED
SO IF WE EACH DO OUR PART TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND WE CAN HELP KEEP PENGUINS
HOWEVER THE ENTIRE SOCIAL CONTRACT WILL NEED TO CHANGE IN ORDER TO ACCOMODATE THIS
HOW CAN WE UNDERSTAND THE WORLD IN RAPIDLY CHANGING
IF A COMPANY HAS STANDARDIZED AS THE LEADER OF FAST FOOD INDUSTRY
BUT THE QUESTION IS REALLY ABOUT YOU
AND THIS PHASE CHANGES ARE WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT BECAUSE AS HUMAN BEINGS
THE FIRST IS THE ENERGY SHIFT
IS THE MAIN POWER SOURCE OF OUR SOCIETY TODAY
IT SEEMS TO TREAT JEALOUSY AS A PROBLEM OF GEOMETRY NOT EMOTION
I DON'T KNOW
BECAUSE HE'S NOT LOOKING AT WHAT HIS WIFE IS DOING
IT'S SO MYSTERIOUS AND IT'S SO PERVASIVE
WE KNOW BABIES SUFFER FROM JEALOUSY
WE FORGET HOW HARSH HIS VISION WAS
LIKE LIFE WAS A TREADMILL
AND THIS ONE DAY I HADN'T TAKEN MY GRATEFUL PHOTO FOR THE DAY AND I WAS SCANNING MY LIFE BASICALLY
AND IT SPARKED SOMETHING AMAZING WITHIN ME BECAUSE I STARTED TO SEE THINGS I WOULDN'T
BLAH ABOUT LIFE
I DUG OUT THE MAGAZINE AND I LOOKED AT IT AGAIN
I NEEDED A LOT MORE OF THAT
AND SHE SUDDENLY GAVE ME THAT
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE
YOU HAD BREAKFAST WHAT DID YOU DO AFTER THAT
THIS ISN'T ABOUT POLITICS
IT'S AN ALGORITHM PICKING WHAT IT THINKS THAT YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN AND MAYBE NOT FIND ON
THAT'S WHY FACEBOOK WANTS TO COLLECT ALL THE DATA IT CAN ABOUT YOU
I WAS LIKE COULDN'T PUBLISH WHAT
THAT'S WHY YOU SEE IT IN EVERY SUPERMARKET
I CAN IGNORE THAT
WE DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THEY'RE DOING THIS CATEGORIZATION
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WHEN THEY HEAR THE WORD GENDER THINK IT MEANS WOMEN
I KNOW WE CAN DO IT WE CAN DO BETTER
WHY WAS SHE DRINKING WITH THOSE GUYS IN THAT HOTEL ROOM
SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT BOTH WOMEN AND MEN HAVE IN COMMON
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT
WHAT ABOUT ALL THOSE BOYS
NOT JUST WOMEN AND GIRLS BUT ALSO MEN AND BOYS
THERE'S BEEN AN AWFUL LOT OF SILENCE
HE NEEDS LEADERSHIP TRAINING BECAUSE HE'S BEING A BAD LEADER BECAUSE IN A SOCIETY WITH GENDER DIVERSITY AND
HOW DOES ALL THIS WORK
HOW CAN WE CHANGE THE SOCIALIZATION OF BOYS AND THE DEFINITIONS OF MANHOOD THAT LEAD TO THESE CURRENT OUTCOMES
ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT MARY IS NOT GOING TO GET US ANYWHERE IN TERMS OF PREVENTING VIOLENCE
THEY DIDN'T MAKE THE CHOICE
BECAUSE THE TYPICAL PERPETRATOR IS NOT SICK AND TWISTED
WHAT DO WE DO
WE DON'T LIKE IT WHEN PEOPLE CHALLENGE OUR POWER
ADULT MEN WITH POWER ARE THE ONES WE NEED TO BE HOLDING ACCOUNTABLE FOR BEING LEADERS ON THESE ISSUES BECAUSE WHEN SOMEBODY SPEAKS UP IN A
THERE'S SOME CONFUSION ABOUT THE TERM GENDER
OTHER PEOPLE WILL SAY WELL GET OFF IT
SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE IN OUR SOCIETY AND IN THE WORLD
THAT'S A GOOD ENGLISH SENTENCE
THIS IS ALL UNCONSCIOUS
WHY DO THEY KEEP GOING BACK
I KNOW THERE'S MORE THAN MEN AND WOMEN THERE'S MORE THAN MALE AND FEMALE
AND OFTEN TIMES MEN LIKE MYSELF GET A LOT OF CREDIT AND PUBLIC ACCLAIM FOR DOING THE WORK THAT WOMEN
BUT WE ALSO OWE IT TO OUR SONS
BUT WHEN YOU GET INTO IT YOU REALIZE THERE ARE PRESSURES ON MEN
THERE'S BEEN AN AWFUL LOT OF SILENCE IN MALE CULTURE ABOUT THIS ONGOING TRAGEDY OF MEN'S VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND CHILDREN
IT'S A LEGITIMATE THING TO ASK
THE QUESTIONS ARE NOT ABOUT MARY THEY'RE ABOUT JOHN
I'M USING THE GENDER BINARY
BUT HOW DO WE NOT REMAIN SILENT IN THE FACE OF ABUSE
THAT'S A VERY NAIVE NOTION RIGHT
HOW DO WE SPEAK UP
YOU KNOW WHAT
THERE'S A WHOLE SPECTRUM
WE ALSO OWE IT TO YOUNG MEN WHO ARE GROWING UP ALL OVER THE WORLD IN SITUATIONS WHERE THEY DIDN'T MAKE THE CHOICE TO BE A
MY ARGUMENT IS HE DOESN'T NEED SENSITIVITY TRAINING
AND IF WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT MALE VICTIMS LET'S TALK ABOUT MALE VICTIMS
SO ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE CAN USE THE SPOTLIGHT IS TO THANK WOMEN AND HONOR WOMEN'S LEADERSHIP GOING FORWARD
BUT ON A BIG SCALE WE NEED MORE ADULT MEN WITH POWER TO START PRIORITIZING THESE ISSUES
JUST LIKE WITH HETEROSEXISM IF YOU'RE A HETEROSEXUAL PERSON AND YOU YOURSELF DON'T ENACT HARASSING OR ABUSIVE BEHAVIORS TOWARDS
WE'VE GONE FROM JOHN BEAT MARY TO MARY WAS BEATEN BY JOHN
WE'RE NOT EVEN THINKING ABOUT JOHN IT'S TOTALLY FOCUSED ON MARY
BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR TAKING A STAND ON THESE ISSUES SHOULD NOT FALL ON THE SHOULDERS OF LITTLE BOYS OR
WE ARE BOTH VICTIMS OF MEN'S VIOLENCE
WE HEAR ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME
WHAT ARE THE ROLES OF VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS IN HELPING TO PRODUCE ABUSIVE MEN
WE KNOW ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT WE CAN EASILY DO THAT
HOW DO WE CHALLENGE OUR FRIENDS
AND LET ME ILLUSTRATE THAT CONFUSION BY WAY OF ANALOGY
BY THE WAY WE OWE IT TO WOMEN
I DON'T SEE THESE AS WOMEN'S ISSUES THAT SOME GOOD MEN HELP OUT WITH
IN FACT I'M GOING TO ARGUE THAT THESE ARE MEN'S ISSUES FIRST AND FOREMOST
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE REALLY
HOW DO WE SUPPORT OUR FRIENDS
WE'LL SEE A RADICAL DIMINUTION OF THE ABUSE
MOST MALE VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE ARE THE VICTIMS OF OTHER MEN'S VIOLENCE
IT'S ALMOST LIKE A CHIP IN OUR BRAIN IS ACTIVATED AND THE NEURAL PATHWAYS TAKE OUR ATTENTION IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION WHEN WE HEAR THE
WHAT ABOUT ALL THE YOUNG MEN AND BOYS WHO HAVE BEEN TRAUMATIZED BY ADULT MEN'S VIOLENCE
NOW WHEN IT COMES TO MEN AND MALE CULTURE THE GOAL IS TO GET MEN WHO ARE NOT ABUSIVE TO CHALLENGE MEN WHO ARE
WHY IS THAT A COMMON PROBLEM IN OUR SOCIETY AND ALL OVER THE WORLD TODAY
RAISE YOUR HAND AND WE'LL TRY TO GET YOU A MICROPHONE
IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE HE REJECTED THE ARISTOTELIAN PREMISE
NOW SIGNIFIERS BECAUSE WORDS REPRESENT ALWAYS IMPERFECTLY SOME CONCEPT
THE EASY EXAMPLE TO ALWAYS BRING UP IS THE WORD DEMOCRACY
PEDERSON WAS TRYING TO COMMUNICATE SOMETHING PROFOUND BEHIND ALL THAT
BUT UNBEKNOWNST TO HIM HIS INTERPRETER EITHER DOES NOT BEST CASE OR WORST CASE OF COURSE IS LYING TO
HE THEN GOES TO DISCUSS SIGNIFIERS AND THE RELATIVITY OF THEM
I'D LEAVE YOU WITH A HYPOTHETICAL THOUGH
TELL PEDERSON WHERE YOU KEEP THE ROCKETS OR WE WILL PUT YOU ALL IN A NAKED PYRAMID RIGHT OVER THERE TAKE PICTURES FOR THE INTERNET ALL OVER
THIS WILL BE WORSE
THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN THROUGH THE RIGOR OF OUR ENGLISH DEPARTMENT UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DISRUPT THAT SEQUENCE YOU GET
BUT I WOULD POSIT IF YOU SAY THE WORD DEMOCRACY' IN IRAQ OR AFGHANISTAN OR SYRIA OR LIBYA OR IN THE UKRAINE
NOW THIS IS KIND OF A FUNNY EXAMPLE OF THE RELATIVITY OF LANGUAGE BUT OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN START TO INTUIT HOW IN MORE SEVERE
BUT WHEN YOU CALL YOUR FRIEND FROM YOUR HOMETOWN OR AT ANOTHER COLLEGE AND SAY I CAN'T TAKE PASS THIS WEEKEND I HAVE
THAT'S THE LAST TIME SOMEBODY BROUGHT ME DEMOCRACY
AND SO THE CONNOTATION IS DIFFERENT
THE LAST THING I WOULD TELL YOU IS CHALLENGE THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE INHERENT THAT MAYBE YOU HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IN A WHILE IN
YOU TAKFIRI KNOW ABOUT ABU GHRAIB
HE KNOWS THERE'S A LOT OF RISK FOR THE PEOPLE HE'S TALKING TO AND DOING THAT HE KNOWS THAT THEY KNOW THAT THEY COULD FACE
SO INSTEAD OF TRY TO ENGAGE A CONCEPT HE KNOWS OR ASSUMES HIS AUDIENCE WILL NOT UNDERSTAND HE HAS RESORTED TO SOMETHING MORE
IF YOU SAY DEMOCRACY HERE AT WEST POINT AND YOU SAY IT IN MOST PLACES IN THE US IT'S NOT LIKE WE THINK ABOUT DEMOCRACY AS THE
CULTURES THROUGH THEIR SHARED VALUES BELIEFS AND EXPERIENCES WILL START TO IDENTIFY THE SAME THEY WILL BECOME
YOU GUYS ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE THIS ALL THE TIME HERE AT WEST POINT
IT'S ABOUT TRUST AND COOPERATION IN A VERY COMPLEX ENVIRONMENT
NOW DO YOU HAVE ANY WEAPONS HERE
IT STANDS IN FOR A ROUTINE SERIES OF QUESTIONS WHEN A PATROL INVESTIGATES A NEW SIGHT
NOW I OFFER THAT HYPOTHETICAL BECAUSE IT'S EMBLEMATIC OF THE WAY THAT WE AS MILITARY OFFICERS OFTEN THINK ABOUT
NOW IN TERMS OF MY COMBAT HYPOTHETICAL THINKING ABOUT A TRANSLATOR IN THIS VERY INSTRUMENTAL WAY IS ABSOLUTELY FINE IT'S A
AND HE CAN BE FAIRLY SURE THAT HIS AUDIENCE KNOWS ABOUT ABU GHRAIB AND WHAT HAPPENED THERE
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR YES OR NO
THE UNIT BELOW THEM DETERMINES TO THAT END THAT THEY NEED TO REDUCE THE VIOLENCE TO AN EXTENT THAT THE CITIZENS CAN
THE NOVEL IS FIVES AND TWENTY FIVES BY AUTHOR MICHAEL PITRE AND IT FOLLOWS A MARINE PLATOON THROUGH IRAQ THE
EVEN IF YOU LOCK YOUR DOOR TIME WILL BREAK INSIDE AND ROB YOU OFF YOUR BREATH
I HAVE NO EVIDENCE TO PROVE THIS TO BE UNTRUE
OF HUMAN INTELLIGENCE IS A VISUAL TEST
IT'S THE RAVEN'S TEST
MAYBE THAT POWER UNDERLIES THE WAY YOU THINK OVERALL
WHAT ABOUT IT
AND YOU CAN WRITE THAT CODE DOWN
HOW MANY GIGAFACTORIES IF YOU LIKE DOES IT TAKE TO GET US THERE
SO THIS WILL BE A VERY SPRY TRUCK
IS THERE A TIE IN HERE WITH HYPERLOOP
SOME ARE VERY SERIOUS ABOUT TRANSITIONING ENTIRELY TO ELECTRIC AND SOME ARE JUST DABBLING IN IT
LIKE WHY DO YOU WANT TO LIVE
EM WELL WHEN IT'S RUNNING AT FULL SPEED YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY SEE THE CELLS WITHOUT A STROBE LIGHT
WE THINK PROBABLY MORE BUT YEAH
WHAT DO YOU LOVE ABOUT THE FUTURE
SOLAR ENERGY WE NEED TO GET THERE SO WE NEED TO MAKE THESE BEAUTIFUL ROOFS
ASPIRATIONALLY THAT'S OUR TARGET
YOU CAN DRIVE THIS AROUND LIKE A SPORTS CAR
THAT'S A REAL FAKE HOUSE
SUSTAINABLE ENERGY WILL HAPPEN NO MATTER WHAT
COULD YOU APPLY THESE TUNNELS TO USE FOR THIS HYPERLOOP IDEA YOU RELEASED A FEW YEARS AGO
IT TAKES AWAY SO MUCH OF YOUR LIFE
SO THAT'S ROUGHLY A HALF ORDER OF MAGNITUDE IMPROVEMENT RIGHT THERE
BUT WHY NOT JUST DO THAT
THEY HAVE DIFFERENT RULES
DO WE JUST GIVE UP AND FLY AWAY
BUT MATH IS MATH AND WE CAN PLAY AROUND WITH OUR MATH HOWEVER WE WANT
WE ALREADY USE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES IN PARTS OF THE LHC BUT IMAGINE DESIGNING A PARTICLE
AS A KID I WOULD PUZZLE OVER QUESTIONS JUST LIKE THIS
BUT ONE OF THESE OPTIONS IS HUGE AND IT HAS TO DO WITH THAT LONG STANDING QUESTION THAT
WE DON'T DECIDE WHERE NATURE PLACES NEW PARTICLES
BUT THEN WHAT DO WE DO
THAT'S THE STAGE WE'RE AT NOW
WE ONLY DECIDE TO KEEP EXPLORING
BUT WHAT IF
ABSOLUTELY NOT WE WOULD BE TERRIBLE SCIENTISTS IF WE DID
AND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PLAYING AROUND WITH EXTRA DIMENSIONS OF SPACE FOR A VERY LONG TIME BUT IT'S ALWAYS BEEN AN ABSTRACT MATHEMATICAL
I SEE THE LOOKS ON YOUR FACES
AND WE'LL NEED TO ENCOURAGE MORE PEOPLE TO JOIN US IN STUDYING SCIENCE SINCE WE NEED FRESH EYES ON THESE CENTURY OLD
I WOULD FIDDLE AROUND WITH MICROSCOPES AND ELECTROMAGNETS AND I WOULD READ ABOUT THE FORCES OF THE SMALL AND ABOUT QUANTUM
AND TO DO THAT WE HAVE TO BUILD A BIGGER HIGHER ENERGY COLLIDER AND THE BIGGEST HIGHEST ENERGY COLLIDER IN THE WORLD
MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES HAD BEEN WORKING THEIR ENTIRE CAREERS FOR THIS MOMENT AND FRANKLY TO LITTLE CURIOUS ME
SO 2015 WAS GO TIME
WHAT IF THE ULTIMATE QUESTION WHAT IF EVEN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CAN'T HELP US ANSWER OUR QUESTIONS
AND THAT'S HOW I DISCOVERED MY PURPOSE IN LIFE
SO BACK TO WHERE IT ALL STARTED OF THIS TALK
SO AS SCIENTISTS WE STARTED WONDERING WHAT OTHER TYPES OF PHYSICAL PHENOMENA PRODUCE TINY
THAT WE COULD NOW USE OUR CAMERAS TO MEASURE
THIS IS OUR TEAM
MAYBE EXERCISE A LITTLE BIT
SELF MASTERY THIS IS YOUR INNER WORK
WHAT MATTERS IS WHAT YOU BELIEVE
WE WORKED ON HER BELIEF SYSTEM
MAKE SURE YOU WRITE IT DOWN
STAY BEHIND LATER
GIVE PRAISE FOR THE PARTS OF YOUR BODY THAT ARE WORKING
TURBULENT RELATIONSHIPS WITH HIS FAMILY LED HIM TO TO BE THROWN OUT
IN HIS MID 20S HE HAD A BREAKDOWN
YOU SEE EVERYONE WANTS SOCIETY TO CHANGE
CHANCES ARE I MEAN YOU'RE A COOL AND YOU'RE HERE SO THEY'RE PROBABLY PRETTY COOL TOO
OR WITH WHOM YOU DO NOT ENGAGE IN ANY SOCIAL MEDIA INTERACTION AT ALL
AFTER THIS AWESOME CONFERENCE IS OVER YOU'RE GOING TO GO OUT WITH YOUR FRIENDS PERHAPS TO THE AFTER PARTY
WHAT HAS FRIENDSHIP BECOME IN THE AGE OF FACEBOOK
DO YOU HAVE ANY FRIENDS
SO I APOLOGIZE IF I MOVE QUICKLY BUT I HAVE FULL FAITH THAT YOU'LL HAVE NO PROBLEM KEEPING UP
DO YOU HAVE ANY FRIENDS WITH WHOM YOU ARE NOT FACEBOOK FRIENDS
HIS NAME WAS BILL CAMERON
I WENT BACK
HE HAS BROKEN HIS NECK VERY HIGH
I'LL THANK YOU
I WAS READY TO GIVE UP ON MY DREAM
BILL WAS GIVING A GUEST LECTURE AND AT THE END OF THAT LECTURE HE SAID BY THE WAY I'M WORKING WITH THIS YOUNG MAN
NOT DISTRACTED BY UNNECESSARY DISCUSSION OR NOISES THAT AREN'T RELATED TO THE JOB
HE BECAME ONE OF MY REAL KEY MENTORS
THAT I WANTED TO WORK ON INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITY
BRAIN COMPUTER INTERFACE ISN'T QUITE READY YET
PEOPLE WITH ONE HAND WILL THANK YOU
MOST PRODUCTIVE BAKER I'VE EVER HAD
I BLASTED DOWN THERE AFTER THE END OF THAT LECTURE AND INTRODUCED MYSELF
BILL SAW THIS PASSION IN ME
HOW DO YOU DO THAT
BUT A GUEST LECTURER CAME NEAR THE END OF MY UNDERGRAD
I THINK IT'S THE PERSPECTIVE A LOT OF EMPLOYERS AND BOSSES HAVE TODAY BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH
IT WAS BACK IN 1975
I GOT OUT OF THE CAR AND I WAS RUNNING TO THE WASHROOM
AN EASY TO OPEN DOOR MIGHT ACTUALLY CATCH ON
BUT WHAT WE FORGET THEN IS THAT MOST OTHER PERSONS B WOULD EXPERIENCE EXACTLY THE SAME FEELINGS AND FOR THAT REASON THEY WOULD
TRUSTFUL PEOPLE ARE PERCEIVED TO BE WARM AND COMPETENT AND DISTRUSTFUL PEOPLE ARE PERCEIVED TO
SO FOR INSTANCE WHEN BEING PERSON B IN SUCH A TRUST GAME WE THINK
IF PERSON B TURNS OUT TO BE TRUSTWORTHY YOU'VE MADE TEN EUROS OUT OF YOUR FIVE
AND THE RESULTS ALWAYS LOOKED VERY SIMILAR
IN 1949 ANTONIO MONIZ GOT THE NOBEL PRIZE FOR AN
I WANT YOU TO THINK
SO THIS IS IT JUST FOLLOW NOW
IF YOU OPERATE UPON IT AT A SMALLER SIZE THE RISK WITH THE OPERATION
AND THE VARIATION IS 480
WELL ALL THESE TALKS ON TED
WHAT HAVE THEY DONE
SO I HAVE A WILLING VOLUNTEER THAT I MET BACKSTAGE JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO A BRAVE YOUNG WOMAN NAMED ALLIE WHO'S AGREED TO COME
THEY'VE SHIFTED FROM FEELING FRUSTRATION TO FEELING A HEART RELATED EMOTION
THE BOTTOM VIEW'S THE SAME PERSON A FEW MINUTES LATER
AT HEARTMATH WE'VE DONE LOTS OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH TO LOOK AT HEART IN A DIFFERENT WAY AND TO
HOW DOES THE FIELD IN THIS ROOM RIGHT NOW FROM THE ACCUMULATION OF ASSOCIATION WITH EACH OTHER AND ALL THE GREAT SPEAKERS HOW DOES THAT
THAT WAS WHAT WAS MOST IMPORTANT
WE HAD NO ESTABLISHED LABEL LIKE ROGERS AND HAMMERSTEIN OR A SUCCESSFUL MOVIE OR A NOVEL
BECAUSE THEIR TEXT WILL BE VERY BORING
THE MOST LIKELY THING IS THAT THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING ELSE
WHAT'S THAT REALLY LIKE
MORE THAN THEY NEED US TO SPY ON THEM THEY NEED US TO HELP THEM FIGURE OUT WHAT DO WE DO WHEN THINGS GO WRONG IN A
BUT THEY'RE TURNING THE TIMER BACK ON US
AND NOW MANY OF US DEPEND ON THE TELEPHONE TO SUPPORT FAMILY LIFE
YOU CAN SET IT ON A 3 MINUTE SETTING OR IF YOU FOND OF FIVE MORE MINUTES IN YOUR CHILDREN YOU CAN GET FIVE MORE MINUTES
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO WATCH A SLUMBER PARTY THAT YOU WEREN'T INVITED TO UNFOLD
AND IT'S REALLY HELPFUL FOR THE KIDS
AND SO WE NEED TO REALLY GET CURIOUS WHAT COULD THIS PERSON BE DOING
EMPATHY IS THE APP
EVERY SINGLE KID THAT I HAVE MET THIS AGE WHO I'VE TALKED TO ABOUT WHAT PROBLEMS IN YOUR LIFE DOES
SO WHAT IT DOES IS YOU TRAIN THE APP TO RECOGNIZE THE VOICE OF YOUR CHILDREN SO THAT RANDOM KIDS CAN'T
SO THIS SUGGESTS AGAIN THAT THEY REALLY DO NEED ADULT MENTORSHIP
WE PROBABLY ALL NEED A LITTLE APP THAT GIVES A LITTLE THOUGHT BUBBLE
THEY'RE SLEEPING THEY'RE DOING THEIR HOMEWORK THEY'RE EATING DINNER WITH THEIR PARENTS
AND THE CHALLENGING PIECES
BECAUSE IN ORDER TO RAISE KIDS WITH EMPATHY WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT THEIR DAY TO DAY LIVES
SO THEY DESIGNED AN APP
WE HURT THEIR FEELINGS IN SOME WAY
WE WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT THE SALACIOUS NEWS HEADLINES AND NOT ENOUGH ABOUT WHAT
I HEARD A BAD NEWS STORY
AS A MEDIA HISTORIAN I CAN SAY THAT
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO SEND THAT
BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE TRAIN MOVING MORE THAN 30 MILES AN HOUR
WE DON'T HAVE TO BE PLUGGED IN ALL THE TIME
THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'RE NOT NEEDED
ANY TYPE OF SUPPLIES THAT THEY WANT AND IT ENDS UP ON THEIR FRONT DOOR STEP
WE ARE A FOR PURPOSE COMPANY
SO THEY COULD WELL BE IN A SPECTRUM LIKE THIS
SO STARTING OFF WITH THIS QUESTION CAN WE MAKE BEER IN SPACE
BUT IN HIGH CONCENTRATIONS ONCE AGAIN YOU DON'T WANT THIS STUFF IN YOUR BEER BECAUSE NOBODY LIKES TO DRINK A PINT OF BUTTER
OUT OF ALL THOSE MOLECULES THAT WE'RE MISSING AT THE MOMENT WE HAVE NO INFORMATION ON WHERE THEIR PEAKS
IN FACT IT'S NOT TRADITIONALLY DONE
IN URINATION HABITS
BUT I STILL HAVE SIX AND A HALF MINUTES
HE SAID WELL WE HAVE THE BING SEARCHES
BUT THE FDA HAS MADE AVAILABLE AN AMAZING DATABASE
WE NEED SECURE SYSTEMS
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT SAY THAT
THE TWO DRUGS ACTUALLY CAUSED PROBLEMS
BUT I'M SORRY WE STILL DON'T HAVE A PAPER BECAUSE THIS IS 10 PATIENTS AND GIVE ME A BREAK IT'S NOT ENOUGH PATIENTS
WE TOOK MICE AND WE GAVE THEM ONE P PAROXETINE
LET'S GO INTO THE STANFORD ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD
I SAID YOU KNOW NICK WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND HOW DRUGS WORK AND HOW THEY WORK TOGETHER AND HOW THEY WORK SEPARATELY AND WE DON'T HAVE A
HE SAID RUSS I CAN PREDICT WITH 93 PERCENT ACCURACY WHEN A DRUG WILL CHANGE GLUCOSE
DIFFERENCES IN FATIGUE
YES WE CAN DO PAIR WISE A AND B A AND C A AND D BUT WHAT ABOUT A B
HE TOOK ALL THE DRUGS THAT WERE KNOWN TO CHANGE GLUCOSE AND A BUNCH OF DRUGS THAT DON'T CHANGE GLUCOSE AND SAID WHAT'S THE
THEY STUDIED IT VERY CAREFULLY SKEPTICALLY THEY APPROVED IT
HAVE THEY BEEN STUDIED WITH RESPECT TO THEIR NINE WAY INTERACTION
THEY HAVE A ROUGH IDEA OF HOW IT WORKS THEY HAVE A ROUGH IDEA OF WHAT THE SIDE EFFECTS ARE
THEY INCREASED GLUCOSE
5 TO ONE PERCENT OF ALL SEARCHES ON THE INTERNET INVOLVE ONE OF THOSE WORDS
AND THE FINAL THING I WANT TO SAY IS IN THIS CASE WE FOUND TWO DRUGS AND IT WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A SAD STORY
IF PEOPLE TYPE IN PAROXETINE OR PAXIL THOSE ARE SYNONYMS AND ONE OF THOSE WORDS THE RATE GOES
ALL THOSE THINGS CONSPIRED TO GIVE HIM A REALLY GOOD PREDICTOR
IT'S A DATABASE OF ADVERSE EVENTS
NICK CAME BACK
HE DID THIS IN HIS PHD FOR HUNDREDS OF PAIRS OF DRUGS
AND THERE'S A BUNCH OF DRUGS NOT VERY EXCITING
WHAT DO YOU DO
WE COULD HAVE FOUND TWO DRUGS OR THREE DRUGS THAT WERE INTERACTING IN A BENEFICIAL WAY
WELL IT'S VERY HARD TO DO THAT
WE SUBMITTED THE PAPER
I DON'T DO THAT
HOW DO DRUGS WORK
THEY TAUGHT US HOW TO FEED MICE DRUGS
I SAID NOW YOU'RE TALKING
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT SAY THAT SO I DID ONE OTHER EXPERIMENT
HAVE YOU MET MY EX
AND SO I HAD THIS BRILLIANT PLAN FOR THE MIDTERM
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU A STORY THAT'S NOT IN THE FILM
WITNESS NN IS IN THE FILM THIS STORY IS NOT
WHAT'S RAPE'S BRAND
THREW US OFF A LITTLE BIT
WE ACTUALLY THOUGHT WE'D FOUND THAT GUY FOR OUR SECOND DOCUMENTARY
IF YOU HAVE MET A REFUGEE OR A MIGRANT IN PERSON THAT EXPERIENCE WILL INFORM YOUR VIEWS
WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT WHILE WE ARE FOCUSING ON THESE IMAGINARY FEARS
YES NOT ALL REFUGEES AND MIGRANTS ARE NICE PEOPLE IT'S NOT A PERSONALITY COMPETITION
BUT LET ME BE A JOURNALIST FOR A SECOND AGAIN
HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE DIED DURING THE WAR IN BOSNIA
AND IT CAN BE POSITIVE IT CAN BE NEGATIVE
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE FACTS THAT ARE READILY AVAILABLE TO ALL OF US RIGHT NOW AS WELL AS TO JOURNALISTS ON OUR
WELL THIS WORRIES ME BECAUSE DEHUMANIZATION IS STAGE THREE OF THE EIGHT STAGES OF
IT IS NOT RACIST TO TALK ABOUT IMMIGRATION
THIS IS AN INCREASE FROM 2
THE SOURCE OF MY HOPE ARE BRILLIANT PEOPLE I MEET EVERYDAY REFUGEES AND MIGRANTS AS WELL AS
WE INVITE OTHER POWERFUL WOMEN TO SHARE THEIR POWER AND TO SUPPORT THEM AND
NOW I DON'T GET TO TALK ABOUT FACTS A LOT SO PLEASE INDULGE ME
OUR BORDERS ARE OUT OF CONTROL
AND FOR ONCE I AGREE
SO I DECIDED TO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT
NOW I WAS A REFUGEE
I LOVED BEING A RADIO JOURNALIST
ALMOST EXACTLY FIVE YEARS LATER ON A BEAUTIFUL APRIL DAY
IT'S THE LONGEST OF THIS KIND IN THE HISTORY OF MODERN WARFARE
WHEN WE DO THAT WHEN WE SEE MIGRATION AS THE FACT OF LIFE
WE HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO THINK ABOUT THE WAYS WE TALK ABOUT GENDER
BUT THIS IS NO ORDINARY WELL
AND THEN SOMETIMES I ACTUALLY STOP MYSELF AND THINK
THE DEFENDERS OF THE INDUSTRY SAY IT'S NECESSARY BECAUSE THE BIRDS ARE AGGRESSIVE
FOR MOST PEOPLE THEIR ENCOUNTERS WITH POULTRY ARE WHEN THEY'RE IN THE SUPERMARKET SHOPPING OR WHEN
US HUMANS HAVE MADE A GREAT ART AT THE DISCONNECT ABOUT WHAT IT IS WE ACTUALLY EAT
BEFORE I STOPPED EATING ANIMALS CHICKEN WAS MY FAVOURITE MEAT
IF DUCK WAS ON THE MENU THAT'S WHAT I'D ORDER
NOW YES I KNOW
TWO THIEVES BROKE INTO THE MUSEUM OF SCIENCE OF COIMBRA IN PORTUGAL
24 YEARS AGO I UNDERWENT A WATERSHED MOMENT IN MY LIFE WHEN I SURVIVED THE ATTACK BY A
WHAT IS MY ROLE
THEY'VE MADE IT CONVERSATIONAL
IT WAS NO BIG DEAL BUT IT WAS A LATRINE
IT'S WHAT I CALL SOCIAL CONTAGION AND IT'S REALLY POWERFUL AND REALLY EXCITING
DIFF AND IT'S RESISTANT TO ANTIBIOTICS IN MANY CASES
SHE WAS SCARED OF DRUNKS HANGING AROUND
WE INGEST NUTRIENTS
AND SHE WAS HORRIFIED TO GET THERE AND FIND THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE A TOILET
SHE'D GROWN UP WITH A LATRINE
HER PERPETRATOR WAS ARRESTED BUT THREE DOLLARS WAS ENOUGH FOR THE POLICE TO WIPE HIS NAME FROM THE
WHAT DO THEY DO
SO WE DECIDED WHAT IF WE COULD IDENTIFY THE HIGHEST VALUE SERVICES AND BUILD THEM IN CONNECTION
PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE ADVOCATES SUPPORT SYSTEMS BUILT IN
WE STARTED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT DOES EVERYONE WANT AND NEED AND HOW TO BUILD AN
AND HE SAID WELL WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO SAY
I HAVE NO FORMAL EDUCATION
BUT WESLEYAN SAID YES AND GAVE KENNEDY A FULL SCHOLARSHIP
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT REMAIN
THAT'S A TERRIBLE OUTCOME FOR TWO REASONS
THAT'S ABOUT OUR TIMELINE
NOW I COINED A TERM IN 2007 CALLED CRITICAL MAKING AND I'VE BEEN STUDYING
AND POTENTIALLY CHANGING THE MATERIAL GEOMETRY OF THIS OBJECT IN ORDER TO INCREASE ITS STRENGTH
AND IN FACT OUR PROJECT KIND OF FITS WITHIN SOME OF THAT LOGIC IS WELL THE IDEA OF USING THIS EMERGING
STUDENT RYAN SCHMIDT
THEY'VE BEEN THERE FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS
THEY GET ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH THE PROCESS
AND THEN DUE TO THE CONTINGENCIES OF A SUBSISTENCE LIFE THEY ARE FORCED TO LEAVE
PEDAGOGY FIRST TECHNOLOGY SECOND IF APPROPRIATE
HE GOES TO PS3 IN STATEN ISLAND NEW YORK
THIS WAS MY SCHOOL
MY SON NICOLAS IS 9
OUR STUDENTS WERE ABLE TO GO ON LEATHER COUCHES IN A ROOM THAT WE CLEANED OUT AND THEY COULD TAKE NAPS ON THEIR FREE TIME
WE TAKE THE OLD INDEPENDENT STUDY CONCEPT
IT NEEDS TO BE IMPORTANT TO US TO CREATE SCHOOLS THAT WORK BETTER FOR OUR KIDS IF WE
IT IS RELEVANT MEANINGFUL AND ENGAGING
HOW DO I KNOW THIS
AND THE PROBLEM IS THE ADULTS
AND THEY WOULD SAY WELL WHAT ABOUT YOU
I'VE HAD SOME GREAT MEALS AT CAFETERIAS
THEY ANSWERED MY PHONE
I WANTED TO SEE HOW DRESSING BIBLICALLY AFFECTED MY MIND
I WANTED IT TO BE ABOUT RELIGION IN AMERICA
AND IT ACCELERATES THE AMOUNT AND LEVEL OF THE STIMULATION
TO BE INTERESTED
AND HE WAS WALKING AROUND
THE AUDIENCE IS TOO SMALL
AND IT WORKS
BUT THEY ASKED ONE QUESTION
THE NEXT ISSUE THAT RESOLVED WAS THAT IF 90 PERCENT OF HEAD AND NECK PAIN IS CAUSED BY
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I HAD IN MY MIND
BUT THE ROMANS DEVELOPED SALTING
BECAUSE GPS DOESN'T WORK UNDER WATER
BUT THROUGH A SATELLITE LINK I WAS ABLE TO SIT AT MY STUDY AT HOME WITH MY DOG CURLED UP AT MY FEET A CUP OF TEA IN MY HAND
AND SO AT THAT TIME OF COURSE THERE WAS NO REFRIGERATION
AND WITH SALTING IT BECAME POSSIBLE TO STORE FISH AND TO TRANSPORT IT LONG DISTANCES
BUT THE REALLY INTRIGUING THING ABOUT THE MICROBES IS JUST HOW DIVERSE THEY ARE
AND THEN AT SOME PERIOD OF TIME IT POPS UP TO THE SURFACE AND AGAIN RELAYS THAT DATA BACK TO SHORE
THAT ALSO DOESN'T EVEN GET INTO THE WHOLE PROTEIN EXTRACTION THAT WE DO FROM THE OCEAN
MARINE ORGANISMS DO NOT CARE ABOUT INTERNATIONAL BOUNDARIES THEY MOVE WHERE THEY WILL
BUT YOU CAN IMAGINE THE BIOMASS THAT REPRESENTS
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE PILOT DID FOR ME
THAT'S THE SORT OF TECHNOLOGY THAT'S AVAILABLE TODAY THAT REALLY WASN'T AVAILABLE EVEN A DECADE AGO
SO FISHERMEN COULD ONLY CATCH WHAT THEY COULD EITHER EAT OR SELL THAT DAY
WELL FROM THAT DISCUSSION GREW THIS PROGRAM THAT INVOLVED 2700 SCIENTISTS FROM MORE THAN 80 COUNTRIES AROUND THE
SO WHAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING IS SOMETHING CALLED SHIFTING BASELINES
AND SO WHAT THEY FOUND IN FACT IS THAT EXPLOITATION REALLY BEGAN HEAVILY WITH THE ROMANS
THE TRAINING USES SIMPLE FOCUSING TECHNIQUES TO ACCOMPLISH THIS
SO A TRAINING PARTNER A TEACHER WILL PUSH ON ME TO SEE HOW STABLE I AM ON MY FEET
MOVING UP THE TRAIL WE FIND VESTIBULAR ACTIVITY IN THE BRAIN'S MEMORY CENTER THE
AM I JUST GOING TO
I PRACTICED LIKE CRAZY
I WAS SHAKING
SECOND HARD WORK
BUT I DID THEM DIFFERENTLY IN MY UNIQUE WAY
I WENT TO HOLLAND I WENT TO DENMARK
THAT WAS MY DREAM
SO THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHO I WAS
BUT ACTUALLY THE OPPOSITE HAPPENED
SO THEY DEVELOPED CHEMICALS TO KILL EACH OTHER
I WAS VERY FORTUNATE I WAS ABLE TO GO TO STANFORD FOR MEDICAL SCHOOL AND I HAVE MY MPH FROM HARVARD
SO HISTORICALLY OUR TRIBE HAS BEEN USING ANTIBIOTICS FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS POTENTIALLY
I WAS REALLY WORRIED ABOUT WHAT MY UNCLES WOULD THINK ABOUT THAT
THEY WERE NOT DISCOURAGING IF ANYTHING THEY WERE VERY ENCOURAGING
NOW WHAT IS INTERESTING WHEN I TALK TO MY UNCLES WHO ARE TRADITIONAL HEALERS THEY TALK ABOUT HOW OVER THE YEARS THEY WOULD USE
THE REASON IS THAT FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS BACTERIA AND MOLD HAVE COMPETED WITH EACH OTHER
AND PROBABLY THE BIGGEST SCIENTIFIC ADVANCE THAT WE FOUND IN MODERN SCIENCE IS THE DISCOVERY OF ANTIBIOTICS
DO MULTIPLE CULTURES HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EMBRACE WHAT THEY ONCE HAD IN TERMS OF A HEALTHIER LIFESTYLE
I AM SURE MANY OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THIS SYMBOL
I HAVE WORKED IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ARENAS OF HEALTH
BUT WE SAW A HUGE CHANGE IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY BECAUSE OF ADVANCES IN SCIENCE
BECAUSE I HAVE HEARD ALL THE STORIES OF HOW OUR TRADITIONAL HEALERS MAYBE HAVE NOT BEEN AS RESPECTED AS THEY COULD BE
I ALWAYS LIKE TO JOKE WHEN PEOPLE SAY WHAT DOES PEJUTA WICASA MEAN
I AM VERY FORTUNATE TO COME FROM A FAMILY WITH A LOT OF TRADITIONAL HEALERS
THERE IS NOTHING SHAMEFUL ABOUT BEING A FEMINIST
I STARTED TO FREAK OUT
I CAN'T DESCRIBE TO YOU HOW QUICKLY I WANTED TO DIVE INTO NUMBNESS GET AWAY FROM THE
AND FROM THESE WORDS THAT I COULD TAKE SHELTER IN I MADE ENTIRE PINTEREST BOARDS AND FROM THOSE BOARDS I
IF ANYBODY IN TOHOKU WANTS TO START MANUFACTURING THIS WE WOULD ACTUALLY HELP THEM
SHE TOLD US I'M GOING TO SPACE AND I WANT TO DO SOMETHING MEANINGFUL WITH THE DATA OF MY MISSION TO REACH OUT TO
SO THIS IS A PICTURE OF CONVENTIONAL THINKING ON LEFT BRAIN RIGHT BRAIN WHICH WE NOW KNOW IS A LOT
NUMBER 2 IS TO CREATE A SAFE SPACE
MY GOAL FOR ALL YOU CREATIVES OUT THERE IS THAT YOU GET YOUR POINT OF VIEW ACROSS IN THE STRONGEST WAY POSSIBLE AND
SO THE TOY COMPANY I REFERENCED AT THE BEGINNING THAT I WAS WORKING ON WHEN I GOT RUN OVER I ENDED GOING BACK TO IT AND IT
SO GIVEN THAT THE CORPORATE ENVIRONMENT REALLY ACTIVATES THE EXECUTIVE ATTENTION NETWORK
THIS ALLOWS ME TO ACTIVATE MOST EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY THE NETWORK THAT IS MOST APPROPRIATE FOR
SO JUST FIND TIME AND A SPACE FOR SOLITUDE EVERY DAY AND IT WILL REALLY HELP FEED YOU
THE TOUGH THING ABOUT BEING A CREATIVE IS YOU'RE REALLY SENSITIVE
I LOVE THAT TIP
SO FOR ME IT WOULD BE MONSTER TRUCKS GUNS AND GARDENING
ONE IS THE EXECUTIVE ATTENTION NETWORK WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO FOCUS ON THE TASK AT HAND PROBLEM SOLVE IT'S A
WHEN YOU HAVE WATCHFUL EYES ON YOU ALL THE TIME IT IS VERY HARD TO TO DO THAT
I FIND THAT DURING THAT INTERSECTION OF DREAMING AND BEING AWAKE I REALLY GET SOME OF MY MOST POWERFUL
SO WHAT I LIKE TO DO IS I LIKE TO IS TO PARCEL OUT MY TIME SO I LIKE TO CLUSTER MY CREATIVE ACTIVITIES TOGETHER
MY TIP NUMBER TWO IS I LOVE JOURNALING IN THE MORNING WHEN I WAKE UP
WOODY ALLEN GETS HIS BEST IDEAS IN THE SHOWER
A LOT OF STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT GETTING IN A MORE MINDFUL MEDITATIVE STATE REALLY HELPS YOU ACCESS
THIS IS THE PRACTICE OF REALLY BEING ABLE TO EMOTIONALLY DETACH FROM WHAT YOU ARE WORKING ON WHICH IS SO HARD AS A
IT IS YOUR JOB AS A CREATIVE TO PUT AS MANY NEW THINGS IN FRONT OF YOU AS POSSIBLE AND MY FAVORITE
IT WAS LIKE THINGS WERE RECONNECTED IN DIFFERENT WAYS IN MY BRAIN
SO IN SUMMARY MY GOAL IS THAT THIS MESSAGE GETS SPREAD TO AS MANY ASPIRING CREATIVES
BUT MOST OF US DOING IT WHERE ARTISTS AND WE ACTUALLY LOST CONTROL OF THE COMPANY TO OUR BOARD BECAUSE WE DIDN'T
AND FINALLY BE RESILIENT
IF YOU CAN SPEAK FROM THAT LANGUAGE THEN IT GIVES YOU PERMISSION TO STRAY FROM THAT AND TALK FROM A LANGUAGE OF
CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTS ARE AMAZING BECAUSE THEY ARE BUSTLING HUBS OF IDEAS AND COLLABORATION
WE WERE EATING FISH FOR BREAKFAST THE CUSTOMS WERE TOTALLY DIFFERENT AND WHAT THAT DID IS THAT IT REALLY SLOWED TIME DOWN FOR
DEVELOP YOUR POINT OF VIEW
THIS IS GOING TO BE THE FOUNDATION AND THE SOUL OF YOUR CREATIVITY
THE NEXT ONE IS BECOME A CURIOUS ANTHROPOLOGIST
A LOT OF THESE INVOLVE JUST FOR A MINUTE FOCUSING ON YOUR FIVE
LEARN THE LANGUAGE OF BUSINESS
THESE ALL SOUND REALLY SIMPLE BUT WHEN PRACTICED THEY ACTUALLY HELP YOU CULTIVATE THAT
BUT I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN STRANGELY DRAWN TO BUSINESS AND THE POWER OF BUSINESS TO SPREAD IDEAS AND AS A PLATFORM FOR
ONE WAS THAT I WAS NOT GOING TO LET ANYONE ELSE'S DEFINITION OF ME DEFINE ME AND MY
I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING MEANINGFUL
SO THANK YOU
YOU LOOSE CREDIBILITY SO IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT
I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING ON A BIG SCALE AND I WANTED TO PLUG INTO A PLATFORM THAT WAS REALLY POWERFUL AND
IT CAN VISUAL YOU CAN WALK OUTSIDE LOOK UP AT A TREE AND JUST REALLY FOCUS ON THAT
RECENTLY I WENT TO JAPAN AND WHAT WAS INCREDIBLE ABOUT THAT WAS NOT
I HAVE DEFINITELY FOUND THAT TO BE TRUE BUT UNFORTUNATELY I CAN NEVER FIND A SOLID 20
JUST AFTER THE ELECTION IN NOVEMBER THE SOUTH AFRICAN ARTIST WILLIAM KENTRIDGE WITH WHOM I'D SPENT A LOT OF TIME
AMERICA NEEDS MY ATTENTION NOW
WE MUST TAKE ACTION AS CITIZENS OF OUR COUNTRIES YET EMBRACE THE LARGER
I'D SAID TO HIM THAT I WANTED TO GET ONE OF THOSE THOSE FUR HATS LIKE THE ONES KARZAI WORE
THEY SAID WE'VE GOT OUR HANDS FULL WITH INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AND SHE CAME UP WITH WHAT SHE REFERRED TO WHEN TALKING TO ME AS HER THREE POINT PROGRAM
I WOULD INVITE THEM INTO MY HUT AND FILL IT WITH STEAM AND WITHIN MINUTES THEY WERE HOLDING OUT THEIR HANDS
I'M NOT INTERESTED IN THEM
YOU'RE AFRAID TO TRY
WE HAD A LITTLE BOY
DID IT WORK
LET'S GO FORWARD
CORRUPTION IS RAMPANT
I SAID NOTHING
BUT EVERYBODY WAS HAPPY TO SEE ME
THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHY THEY DIDN'T TAKE ME AWAY
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU
THEY ARE TRAINING TO BE LAWYERS
AND BY THAT TIME THE WOMEN ARE YELLING AND SCREAMING INSIDE THE CAR
THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND
WHAT CAN I DO FOR THEM
THEY SAID NO
MY HEART WAS IN AFGHANISTAN
I WANTED TO GO BACK HOME
SUPERMARKETS ARE AN EASY PLACE TO START
I WAS SITTING IN A ROADSIDE CAFE
I'D BEEN ROUND THE BACK
IT HAS BEEN A SUCCESS STORY
WE START OUT WITH NINE
JUST START THERE
WRITE LETTERS TO ECCENTRIC RELATIVES
IT HAPPENS BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE JUST TRYING TO GET ALONG WITHIN AN EXISTING SYSTEM
WE NEED YOU TO BE VERY BRAVE
I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS BUT YOU HAVE TO MAKE YOUR MOVIES NOW TODAY FEATURES NOT
I WANT TO SEE WOMEN'S BODIES ON STAGE ON FILM THAT AREN'T PERFECT
AND THIS REVOLUTION IS NOT JUST FOR WOMEN
I MEAN REMEMBER I CAME HERE TO PLAY SMART WILLFUL COMPLICATED INTERESTING
AND ALL OF THE SUDDEN I AM WRESTLING WITH 300 OTHER GORGEOUS TALENTED WOMEN TO PLAY
AND HE SAID YEAH
SO THAT WAS REALLY INTERESTING TO ME
SO A BIG ASK
A VERY GOOD GOLFER SERGIO GARCIA WAS PLAYING AND HE'D BEEN BRILLIANT ALL WEEK
SO YOU'VE GOT TO GET TO GRIPS WITH HOW PEOPLE THINK ABOUT YOU ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT THE WORLD
AS THOUGH IT'S A COMPLETE MYSTERY WHY THESE THINGS HAPPEN
SOME OF YOU ARE GETTING CONTRACTIONS AROUND THAT CUPCAKE SO YOU'VE GOT PRESSURE WAVES BEING CREATED TELLING YOUR BRAIN ABOUT WHAT'S
YOU GO TO SEE YOUR BOSS AND HE SAID OH I'VE GOT SOME 360 DATA
YOU'RE JUST THINKING WHAT YOU'RE THINKING AND DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING
THERE IS AN ENERGETIC STATE GOING THROUGH US
I WAS SAT ON THE COUCH AT HOME WATCHING THE TV ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO
IF WE LOOK AT YOUR HEART RATE OVER TIME WE'LL SEE THAT YOUR HEART RATE WILL VARY UP AND DOWN
I THINK IT WAS IN THE US MASTERS SERGIO PLAYED BRILLIANTLY ALL WEEK
IF WE MEASURE HRV FOR 24 HOURS IT CAN TELL YOU HOW MUCH ENERGY YOU'VE GOT WHICH IS INTERESTING TO LEADERS BECAUSE LEADERS NEED
OR IF HE THINKS WHAT I'M SAYING IS RUBBISH HE WON'T DO IT
I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT YOU AND HOW YOU CAN BE BRILLIANT EVERY SINGLE DAY
MOST PERFORMANCE APPRAISALS IN INDUSTRY FOCUS ON WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A BIT OF LIVE DEMONSTRATION OF SOMETHING
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
ACTUALLY I KNOW WHY THAT HAPPENED AND I KNOW WHY SERGIO GARCIA
THEY DON'T CARE
IF YOU CAN GET CONTROL OVER THE WHOLE THING YOU CAN CRANK OUT YOUR A GAME EVERY SINGLE DAY
I SPENT THE LAST 15 YEARS WORKING WITH SOME OF THE BEST CEOS AND EXECUTIVES AROUND THE WORLD
IT WILL ONLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE IF THE LEADERS STOOD OVER THAT EMPLOYEE CRACKING THE WHIP AND MAKING SURE THEY DO
IT'S COMING INTO YOUR BRAIN TELL YOUR BRAIN WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR GUT RIGHT
WE LOOK AT THE HEART RATE IT'S FAST
WHY WOULD HE
BUT WE MAY NOT ALL HAVE FEELINGS
WE'VE ALL GOT EMOTIONS EVERY SECOND OF EVERY DAY
IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THEIR THINKING YOU HAVE TO CHANGE HOW THEY FEEL
DON'T KNOW WHY I'M LOOKING AT SIMON WHEN I SAY THAT
THE MOUTH'S DRY
SO I'M SHOUTING AT THE TELEVISION
GIVEN SO MANY DIFFERENT SIGNALS WHERE ARE WE GOING TO START
YOU'VE GOT TO GET TO GRIPS WITH WHAT'S ON THE INSIDE OF INDIVIDUALS
BUT OUR VIEW IS IF YOU DON'T GET TO GRIPS AND START TO ASK SOME MORE DETAILED QUESTIONS YOU WON'T GET A SUSTAINABLE CHANGE IN THE
SO SOME OF YOU HAD THE CUPCAKE AT THE BREAK AND YOU'LL BE GETTING A SIGNAL FROM YOUR GUT SAYING OH SUGAR
THAT'S WHERE THE PROBLEM IS
HE GOT TO THE SUNDAY AND SOMETHING WENT WRONG HE WAS LEADING THE FIELD BY SIX SHOTS AND ON THE
SO WE CAN'T SELL THEM ON THAT
IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE RESULT BY CHANGING THE BEHAVIOUR THERE ARE MULTIPLE LEVELS
DID YOU KNOW WHAT
THE ENERGY MAY BE THERE BUT WE JUST DON'T FEEL IT
AND YOU SAY ALRIGHT
SO OVERNIGHT HE'D LOST TEN SHOTS ON THE SAME HOLE
BUT EVEN IF YOU DID IT'S NOT ENOUGH
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE MOUTH
I KNOW I OUGHT TO MAKE ANOTHER THOUSAND CALLS TO A THOUSAND CUSTOMERS BUT DO YOU KNOW WHAT
BECAUSE WE KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT
IT DOESN'T SOLVE ANY PROBLEMS
BUT INSTEAD JUDGE PEOPLE BY THEIR ACTIONS AND NOT BY THEIR FAITH
LET'S DESIGN TO MAKE IT BEAUTIFUL AS ADVANCED POTTY TRAINING
WILL THEY BE GAINFULLY EMPLOYED
AND I CARE SO MUCH ABOUT THIS QUESTION THAT I WORK FOR A NONPROFIT CALLED RECODE
WE THINK THE PROBLEM IS SOLVED HERE IN THE US
THE OTHER HALF GOES RIGHT OUT THE OTHER SIDE
WE TALK ABOUT THE BRAIN BUT OF COURSE EVERY BRAIN IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT AND MAYBE THERE ARE SOME INDIVIDUALS OR SOME
EINSTEIN THIS EXAM WHICH YOU JUST GAVE TO THE SENIOR CLASS OF PHYSICS STUDENTS
BECAUSE WHAT WE HAVE FOUND IS THAT BREAKTHROUGH INNOVATION EXTRAORDINARY RESULTS HAPPEN
IF YOU HAVE TUNNEL VISION THAT'S A BIT OF A PROBLEM BECAUSE IT CONFUSES PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR OWN PERFORMANCE
IT'S INTERESTING IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA APPROXIMATELY THREE PER CENT OF PEOPLE ARE INCLINED TO EVEN DO DIFFERENT THINGS
WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THINKING
ANOTHER EXAMPLE IF YOU OWNED A COMPUTER BUSINESS AND ONE DAY YOU DECIDE TO NO LONGER SELL YOUR COMPUTER USING A PHYSICAL
IF YOU TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT YOUR INDUSTRY OR PROFESSIONAL FIELD YOU ALSO THINK
THEY SAID WELL ACTUALLY THEN WE MAKE TWO KINDS OF TAXIS
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WOULD HAVE A FURNITURE BUSINESS AND ONE DAY YOU WOULD DECIDE TO NO LONGER
THIS IS THE REASON THAT MANY PEOPLE GO THROUGH LIFE ACTING LIKE A MEDIOCRE RACE CAR DRIVER
EINSTEIN HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY DO THAT
IN OTHER WORDS WHAT IS TRUE FOR 1942 IS EVEN MORE TRUE FOR TODAY
AND IF YOU WANT TO HAVE RESULTS THAT YOU'VE NEVER HAD BEFORE WELL YOU NEED TO START DOING THINGS YOU'VE NEVER DONE BEFORE
HE WAS WALKING ON THE CAMPUS WITH HIS ASSISTANT AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE ASSISTANT LOOKED AT ALBERT EINSTEIN AND SAID
BUT WE CAN DO IT IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS
LET ME TELL YOU
I COLLECT SCIENTIFIC PAPERS ON LISTENING
HOW MANY CREATURES DO YOU HAVE INSIDE
HAVE A SHOWER AND WE'LL HAVE DINNER THE CHILD WILL REMEMBER THAT WHATEVER HE OR SHE DID
THAT WILL BE COMMITED TO MEMORIES
IT ENCODES ONLY EIGHTEEN PROTEINS AS OPPOSED TO OUR GENOME WHICH ENCODES OVER 23000
HIV GETS AROUND THIS BY BEING HIGHLY DIVERSE
THESE SIMPLE EIGHTEEN PROTEINS NETWORK LIKE THIS IN EVERY SINGLE INFECTED CELL TO
FROM TRANSCRIPTION AND TRANSLATION TO PROTEIN FOLDING PROTEIN MODIFICATION INTRACELLULAR TRAFFICKING
AND YET THOSE EIGHTEEN SIMPLE PROTEINS ARE ENOUGH TO HIGHJACK EVERY SYSTEM WITHIN OUR CELL
TWO DIFFERENT ROUTES USING THE SAME PRINCIPLE OF ALTERING THE MUTATION RATE TO CONQUER A
IT ADAPTS OVER TIME TO BETTER AND BETTER FIND A VERY SPECIFIC THREAT
IT'S EASY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU HAVE TOO MUCH MUTATION
AND SO CONTROLLING MUTATION IS THE KEY IN DETERMINING THE OUTCOME OF THE INFECTION
EVERY CUT ON YOUR ARM EVERY SCRAPE ON YOUR KNEE
HOWEVER THAT'S NOT THE END OF THE STORY
CASE IN POINT
OTHERS ARE AROUND FOR A LIFETIME
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE VIRUSES THAT ARE UP HERE AND THOSE VIRUSES THAT ARE LYING DEAD AND
IT NEEDS OUR CELLS FOR BASIC METABOLIC PROCESSING
AND HER EYES WERE BLOODSHOT AND SHE SEEMED TO BE IN SHOCK
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME AND HAVE LUNCH TOMORROW
BUT I WAS OFF ON ASSIGNMENT
I WAS VERY WORRIED ABOUT HER
PEOPLE WERE LYING ON THE FLOOR
WE'RE GOING TO DIE FROM THE SMOKE
AND THE HOUSE THAT I HAD SPENT TIME IN WAS EMPTY
I HAD A SLEEPING BAG
CAN I GET HER TO A HOSPITAL
I WANT TO GO BACK AND TALK TO HER
AND THEY WERE ASKED TO RATE THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF THE PICTURES
SO WHAT WE DO IN OUR LABORATORY IS WE TEST TV COMMERCIALS AND WE MONITOR ACTIVITY IN THE
IS THERE A LOGO OR NO LOGO
BUT WHY DO WE DO IT
AND THE AUDIENCE ME MYSELF AS WELL WE'RE COMPLETELY OFF
LET'S TRY ANOTHER ONE SO HERE'S A SECOND EXAMPLE
WHO SAYS IF THERE'S EXPENSIVE CLOTHING I'M GOING TO DONATE A SMALLER AMOUNT
IT WASN'T HIS CHILD
BECAUSE I WAS BEING ABUSED
HOW I GOT HERE
BUT IT CAN HAPPEN
I'D NEVER SEEN THAT FEAR BEFORE
ENOUGH WAS ENOUGH
I WASN'T GOING TO HURT ANYONE
MY DAUGHTER WENT THROUGH A LONG COURT CASE AND WE WERE ONE GREAT UNITED FAMILY
WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT THAT COULD HAPPEN
AT THAT MOMENT I KNEW I NEEDED TO GET OUT
WHY DID YOU MAKE ME DO THAT
WE GET THEM AN EDUCATION
IT'S JUST ABOUT EMPOWERING AND HELPING WOMEN
LOOK IN THE BATHROOM
ACTUALLY WE HAD JUST CLIMBED THE TREE
WHAT WE SAW WAS THAT PEOPLE THROUGHOUT ASIA PEOPLE THROUGHOUT AFRICA THROUGHOUT SOUTH AMERICA THEY TOLD US
EVERYONE HAD JUST GOTTEN BACK DOWN
I GOT AN EMAIL ON MY PHONE
BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A DEVICE TO GO UP IN THE TREES
AND YET HERE WE ARE TODAY ABOUT HALF OF THE RAINFOREST REMAINS AND WE HAVE POTENTIALLY MORE URGENT PROBLEMS LIKE CLIMATE
THEY CAN LISTEN TO THE SOUNDS OF THE FOREST
IT'S NOT THE PRODUCT OF SOME KIND OF NATURAL EVOLUTION
IT DOESN'T HAVE MY NAME ON IT
WE'RE PLANNING TO KEEP IT ON OUR BOOKS FOR 30 YEARS
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS
MILLIONS OF JOBS IN MANUFACTURING AND SMALL BUSINESSES ARE GONE AND ALL WE'VE GOTTEN IN EXCHANGE ARE VERY LOW
IT'S THE LOGICAL OUTCOME OF A SET OF POLICIES
I JUST HAD A QUESTION ABOUT IT
IT'S GOING TO SOUTH CAROLINA
IT'S COMING FROM ARIZONA
IS THIS BOOK FOR STACY MITCHELL
JUST IMAGE IF WE TOOK A SMALL AMOUNT OF THE SAVINGS AND REDIRECTED IT TO NEW INITIATIVES TO GROW
I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ORDER
SO HE WENT TO THE WEBSITE OF LONGFELLOW BOOKS
MY LOCAL BOOKSTORE IN PORTLAND
AND PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES ARE AMONG THE LOWEST IN THE COUNTRY
BUT WHAT I WANT TO SUGGEST TO YOU TODAY IS THAT A PURELY CONSUMER BASED RESPONSE TO THIS PROBLEM ON
THEY GET TO KNOW THE BORROWER FACE TO FACE
SO MUCH SO THAT WHEN IT STUMBLED AND FOUND ITSELF TEETERING ON THE VERGE OF BANKRUPTCY PARLIAMENT
WHY HAVEN'T YOU TAKEN A SHOWER
HE COULD HAVE JUDGED ME LIKE THOSE ON THE BUS
SHE'S LAUGHING SHE TRUSTS ME
SHE SAYS I CAN'T
I FOUND MYSELF TRYING TO ESCAPE
HE CHOSE COMPASSION
BECAUSE JUDGEMENT AND SHAME PERPETUATES THIS ILLNESS
AND NOW I'M WORRIED
BUT THIS TIME AFTER ABOUT 30 MINUTES SHE STARTS TO CRACK A SMILE
AND WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS
HOW DO WE MOVE FORWARD FROM HERE
SO WITH THAT I WILL LEAVE YOU
HIS STYLE ON POINT
THE FLIP SIDE OF THIS IS THAT WHEN YOU COME HOME AT NIGHT I WOULD DARE GUESS THAT PRETTY
TWO PEOPLE IN MY LAB
BUT WE SHOULD ALSO THINK ABOUT WHAT IS THIS DOING TO OUR HEALTH IF WE'RE FLOODING OURSELVES WITH THIS
AND WE'RE NOT IN TUNE WITH THE NATURAL LIGHT AND DARK CYCLES RIGHT
BUT WHAT WE'RE EXPOSING OURSELVES TO EVERY DAY NOW IS VERY MUCH INTERFERING WITH
AND IN PARTICULAR WHAT'S REALLY BAD IS THAT THESE DEVICES ARE VERY VERY RICH IN BLUE LIGHT
YOU SHOULD BE FOR 30 TO 60 MINUTES OUTSIDE IN BRIGHT LIGHT SO PUT SOME SUNSCREEN ON AND GO
THEY WONDERED IF THEY SHOULD BE WORRIED
IT TURNED OUT LA HAD JUST SUFFERED A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE WHICH RESULTED IN CITYWIDE BLACKOUTS
IN FACT WHAT THEY WERE SEEING WAS NOT A TRAIL FROM SOME ALIEN SPACESHIP BUT
SO THE ECONOMIST ELOQUENTLY DESCRIBED THE BLOCKCHAIN AS THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
I WOULD GET A BAD REPUTATION AND YOU WOULD REFUSE TO DO BUSINESS WITH ME IN THE FUTURE
THAT'S 127 RIDES PER SECOND SHOWING THAT THIS IS A CROSS CULTURAL
I AM NOT SAYING WE DO NOT NEED HOTELS OR TRADITIONAL FORMS OF AUTHORITY
I'M ON THIS BIG RED CIRCLE
YOU CAN OPEN YOUR EYES NOW
DOES THE WAY WE BUILD TRUST FACE TO FACE TRANSLATE ONLINE
SO WE NEED TO GET THAT STUFF OUT OF THE RIVERS AND ALSO MAKE OUR RIVERBANKS BETTER
THIS IS WALNUT CREEK WHICH RUNS RIGHT IN FRONT OF WALMART IN WINDSOR HEIGHTS IF YOU FOLKS ARE FAMILIAR WITH IT
THIS IS A PICTURE WE TOOK THIS WEEK AS WELL
PLEASE SHOW US YOUR PAIN AND RESISTANCE AGAINST A FACTOR 10
AND IN ONLY FIVE YEARS 1900 COMPANIES HAVE JOINED FROM MORE THAN 40 COUNTRIES
CAN YOU TRUST YOUR NEIGHBORS OR THE NEXT PERSON THAT COMES ALONG
CAN YOU TAKE A SWIM IN THE RIVER WITHOUT HEALTH RISKS
WHY AM I SO SURE ABOUT THAT
WE MIGHT NOT EVEN END UP COMPLETING IT
YOU DON'T ASK FOR PERMISSION
I TOLD HIS STORY AND HE LOVED THAT FACT
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THIS IS GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL
I DIDN'T KNOW ANY BETTER
HIS STORY IS REALLY INCREDIBLE
BUT EVEN MORE THAN THE ART PART OF IT JUST TRAVELING WITH HIM WAS AN EXPERIENCE
SO THE LESSON IS THAT SPACES CAN HAVE THE SAME GEOMETRY THE SAME CURVATURE BUT DIFFERENT TOPOLOGIES
EINSTEIN'S FIELD EQUATIONS WHICH HE ANNOUNCED A HUNDRED YEARS AGO IN 1915 TELL US HOW
APPARENTLY WE'RE LEARNING THAT THERE ARE SURFACES OF DIFFERENT CURVATURE
AND GR IS A THEORY ABOUT SPACE AND TIME
AS IT LEFT THE LESS DENSE PLACES IT HAD TO CLIMB LESS AND IT LOST LESS ENERGY
AND AT THAT POINT THAT PLASMA BECAME A TRANSPARENT GAS
HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THE SAME THING IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE DISTANCES ARE MEASURED IN BILLIONS
AND WHEN THE UNIVERSE WAS ABOUT 400000 YEARS OLD IT WAS ONLY ABOUT HALF THE TEMPERATURE OF THE
I CAN HEAD ANY DIRECTION
BUT IF YOU WANT TO YOU CAN PUT THIS FLAT MAP ON ANY SCREEN OF ANY DEVICE AND IT WON'T GET
AND THE SUM OF THE ANGLES OF THAT TRIANGLE WILL BE 180 DEGREES
SO THE SUM OF THE ANGLES OF THE TRIANGLE ON THIS SPHERE IS MORE THAN 180
IT'S SOMETHING YOU LIVE IN
YOU'RE WRONG BECAUSE IT'S THE OPPOSITE
YOU DON'T BEAT IT ONCE AND IT'S GONE FOREVER
THAT'S WHAT KEEPS YOU FROM GETTING HELP
IT'S SOMETHING YOU LIVE WITH
THAT'S THEIR PROBLEM
SOME PEOPLE MIGHT FEAR SHARKS
SOME PEOPLE MIGHT FEAR DEATH
IT'S THE HOLLOWING OUT OF SMALL TOWNS
IT'S DOWNTOWNS BECOMING GHOST TOWNS
THERE ISN'T A SINGLE LICENSED ARCHITECT IN THE WHOLE COUNTY
THIS IS LAST YEAR IN CHINA
SO I NEED TO DECIPHER WHAT I WROTE
WE ALSO HAVE THE WORLD'S VERY FIRST VEHICLE THAT CAN BE DRIVEN BY THE BLIND
THESE ARE ALL THE TOOLS WE NEED
WE WON A HALF A MILLION DOLLARS IN THE DARPA URBAN CHALLENGE
BUT JUST A SPARK OF IMAGINATION IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH
SO RIGHT NEXT TO MY BED I KEEP A NOTEBOOK A JOURNAL WITH A SPECIAL PEN THAT HAS AN LED LIGHT ON IT BECAUSE I
AND THEY ASSEMBLE AND THEY FORM THESE KINDS OF MECHANISMS
I DIRECTLY RUN TO MY HOME OFFICE SIT AT MY COMPUTER I TYPE IN THE IDEAS I SKETCH THINGS OUT AND I KEEP A DATABASE OF
WE CALL IT THE BLIND DRIVER CHALLENGE VERY EXCITING
NOW THIS ROBOT IS CURRENTLY OUR STAR ROBOT
IT'S A VERY AMBITIOUS GOAL BUT WE TRULY BELIEVE WE CAN DO IT
HOW DO WE DEVELOP THESE KINDS OF IDEAS
THIS IS WHERE SCHOOL COMES IN
HIGH IMPORT DUTIES OFTEN COMPOUND THE PROBLEM SOMETIMES DOUBLING THE PRICE OF A CAR
BUT ONCE AFRICAN INDUSTRY STARTS TO SCALE THE POTENTIAL IS HUGE
THIS REMINDS US THAT WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO EACH OTHER AND A RELATIONSHIP AS A
IN SCOTLAND AND HERE IN GLASGOW WE'RE EXPLORING EXPERIMENTS ABOUT HOW WE CAN TEST THIS OUT IN PRACTICE
LAST YEAR AT A FOOTBALL TOURNAMENT IN ENGLAND A GROUP OF KIDS WHO HAD REACHED THE SEMI FINAL STAGE HAD TO
AND IT'S NOT FREE MONEY IT'S NOT MONEY FOR NOTHING IT'S NOT THE IDEA OF GIVING PEOPLE NOTHING FOR WE
BUT THE LACK OF ACCESS TO FOOD DURING SCHOOL HOLIDAYS MEANT THAT THESE CHILDREN WERE GOING HUNGRY IN A
MOST OF US PROBABLY CAN THINK OF IT PRETTY QUICKLY SADLY SOME PEOPLE WILL STILL PROBABLY BE IN IT
HOW MANY WORLD CHANGING IDEAS POTENTIALLY GET LOST THROUGH THAT WHICH ACCESS TO A SECURE
ALL OF US RELY UPON THE STRUCTURES OF THE STATE OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS AND OF WHAT HAS BEEN DONE FOR
THIS IS YOUR RIGHT
YET WE SEE NOW A SYSTEM WHERE THAT RIGHT TO PROTECT YOU AND GET YOU A HOUSE DIDN'T HELP MATTHEW AND
MICHAEL HAD BEEN SUMMONED IN TO ATTEND A FITNESS FOR WORK INTERVIEW WHICH DESPITE HIS MANY
WHEN SO MANY PEOPLE ARE LIVING AND WORKING THROUGH JOBS WHERE THEY ARE NOT SURE HOW LONG THEIR EMPLOYMENTS ARE GOING TO LAST FOR
SO HERE IS THE SECRET TO SELF CONTROL
SO WHAT THIS EXERCISE DID IS IT GAVE ME A LITTLE BIT OF SPACE BETWEEN ME AND MY THOUGHTS
THE SECRET TO SELF CONTROL IS TO GIVE UP CONTROL
THAT WAS THE JUDGMENT THAT SHE FELT FROM PEOPLE WHEN SHE WOULD BE OUTSIDE SMOKING A CIGARETTE
IT'S A BROAD APPROACH TO BEHAVIOR CHANGE THAT'S BEING USED TO HELP PEOPLE WITH ANXIETY DISORDERS WITH
NOW TO UNDERSTAND WHY I WAS BLOWN AWAY YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE WORLD I LIVE IN
VERY VERY ENCOURAGING
WE CREATE MORTGAGE TERMS THAT WE CAN'T ACTUALLY DEAL WITH
NOW I'M SEEING LOTS OF SMIRKS OUT THERE
THEY'RE WHY PEOPLE IN THE HOUSING MARKET REFUSED TO SELL THEIR HOUSE BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO SELL AT A LOSS
WELL THE SO WHAT
DOES SHE MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES AS US
AND HERE'S THE RUB
AND SO WE RAN A SECOND VERSION OF THIS
DONATE IT TAKE IT AND SO ON
ONE POSSIBILITY IS IN SOME SENSE IT'S NOT REALLY OUR FAULT
BECAUSE IT'S YOURS NOW YOU CAN BUY WHATEVER YOU WANT
WHAT IF WE PUT HOLLY INTO THE SAME CONTEXT AS HUMANS
THE QUESTION IS IS THIS ANYTHING LIKE HUMAN MONEY
SO THAT'S JUST WHAT WE DID
THAT LOOKS DISGUSTING TO ME
YOU KNOW WHERE ARE WE ACTUALLY GOING TO START WITH THIS
MAYBE WE SHOULD SEE HOW THEY DO WITH LOSSES
AND WHAT WE'D REALLY THOUGHT WE'D DONE IS LIKE WE'D ACTUALLY INTRODUCED SOMETHING THAT AT LEAST FOR THE MONKEYS AND US WORKS LIKE A REAL
YOU CAN'T JUST SHUT THAT OFF
CAN WE ACTUALLY SEE IF THE MONKEYS ARE DOING EXACTLY THE SAME DUMB THINGS AS HUMANS DO
SO WHAT'S GOING ON
IT WAS CAMUS WHO ONCE SAID THAT MAN IS THE ONLY SPECIES WHO REFUSES TO BE WHAT HE REALLY IS
YOU REALLY HAVE TO DO WORK TO FIGURE OUT WELL ONE OPTION'S A THOUSAND 2000 ONE IS 1500
DON'T WORRY I'M NOT GOING TO CALL ANYONE IN PARTICULAR OUT ON ANY ASPECTS OF YOUR OWN MISTAKES
DOES SHE NOT LEARN FROM THEM
BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S GREAT FOR US BUT BAD FOR HUMANS
YOU KNOW MAYBE IT'S NOT JUST HUMANS AT THE RIGHT SIDE OF THIS CHAIN THAT'S DUNCEY
THE MONKEYS WOULD RIP OFF THE TOKENS AT EVERY AVAILABLE OPPORTUNITY FROM EACH OTHER OFTEN FROM US YOU KNOW THINGS WE DIDN'T
I'M GOING TO GO WITH THAT
WE CREATE FINANCIAL MARKETS THAT ARE SUPER COMPLEX
THE ERRORS WE MAKE ARE ACTUALLY PREDICTABLE
WHEN WE GET NEGATIVE FEEDBACK WE STILL THE NEXT TIME WE'RE FACE WITH A CERTAIN CONTEXT TEND TO MAKE THE SAME ERRORS
THEY'RE WHY STOCK INVESTORS HOLD ONTO LOSING STOCKS LONGER BECAUSE THEY'RE EVALUATING THEM IN RELATIVE TERMS
WHAT I'M MOST CURIOUS ABOUT IS HOW IS A SPECIES THAT'S AS SMART AS WE ARE
THEY ACTUALLY TEND TO GO A LITTLE RISKY
QUESTION IS DO THE MONKEYS START MESSING UP IN THE SAME WAYS WE DO
ONE OF THEM IS THE TWIN TREE PROGRAM AND THIS IS A POWERFUL PROGRAM
IN REALITY YOU'RE GETTING NOTHING FROM THE LESSON AND YOU'RE REALLY WRITING AN AWFUL EMAIL OUT I HOPE YOU'RE NOT
THEY DID LOTS OF EXAMS FAILED PLENTY OF THEM PASSED SOME AND
THEY MIGHT BE WINNING IDEAS THEY MIGHT BE LOSING IDEAS I WILL KNOW AS I DEVELOP THEM
WHEN IT COMES TO DEVELOPING ANY KIND OF IDEA IN SHAOLIN CULTURE WE START THINKING SMALL
MAYBE SOMETHING SMALL AGAIN THINK SMALL DON'T THINK OF A BIG THING
FOCUS MORE ON THE JOURNEY FOCUS MORE ON THE SMALL STEPS THAT CREATED A JOURNEY RATHER THAN JUST ON
WE PASS IT DOWN FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION
IN MOST COUNTRIES LIKE IN MY COUNTRY FRANCE WE'VE TOLD OUR CHILDREN THAT MANUFACTURING HAD NO FUTURE
MOST OF THEM ARE IN GREAT DIFFICULTIES TODAY
GLOBALIZATION WILL ENTER A NEW ERA
WE'RE THEN READY TO FIGHT FOR A BIGGER ONE
THIS CREATES TENSIONS AND SERIOUS CONFLICTS
LET'S TAKE FASHION RETAIL
SCORE THEM AGAIN
AND TRY THAT AGAIN AND DO THAT FOR ANOTHER GENERATION
I'VE TRIED LOOKING AT THEM AND TELLING YOU HOW THEY WORK
SO THESE COMMUNITIES BEGAN TO EVOLVE SO THAT THE INTERESTING LEVEL ON WHICH EVOLUTION WAS TAKING PLACE WAS NO LONGER A
SO WHAT WAS THE NEXT STEP
WRITING DOWN THE DNA WAS AN INTERESTING STEP
YOU MIGHT ALL SAY OBVIOUS THEY'RE DIFFERENT
I KNOW DEEP DOWN IN YOUR HEART YOU KNOW WHAT'S RIGHT
WHAT DO I MEAN BY THESE KINDS OF THERAPEUTICS
SO WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT
THERE'S THE MODERATOR WHO HAS NO IDEA HOW TO RUN THE MEETING
IT'S RIGHT AT OUR FINGERTIPS LITERALLY
AND A WELL RUN MEETING CAN YIELD REALLY POSITIVE ACTIONABLE RESULTS
YOU'D MAKE A STINK
AND WE'RE MISERABLE NOT BECAUSE THE OTHER GUY CAN'T RUN A GOOD MEETING IT'S BECAUSE OF MAS OUR MINDLESS ACCEPT SYNDROME
AND YET YOU ACCEPT THE MEETING INVITATION AND YOU GO
I'M TALKING ABOUT TIME
AND COLLABORATION IS KEY TO THE SUCCESS OF ANY ENTERPRISE
WE CAN DO THINGS LIKE PREDICTIVE WORK
AND IT'S IN A PLACE CALLED CRISISTRENDS
ARE YOU SURE HE DIDN'T GRADUATE IN THE BOTTOM 10 PERCENT
SO SHE GETS THE ADDRESS AND THE COUNSELOR TRIGGERS AN ACTIVE RESCUE WHILE THEY'RE TEXTING BACK AND FORTH
AND WE'RE NOT HOMOPHOBIC
I WANT SOMEBODY TO TAKE CARE OF THOSE NATIVE AMERICAN RESERVATIONS IN MONTANA
5 MILLION MESSAGES AUTO TAGGING THROUGH NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSES ALL OF THESE DATA POINTS
THINK ABOUT IT THOSE 6
I DON'T THINK OF MYSELF AS A MENTAL HEALTH ACTIVIST
AND I WANT FAMILIES TO SEE THAT SUBSTANCE ABUSE QUESTIONS SPIKE AT 5AM
IT WAS SAD TO SEE AN ICON A FUNNYMAN COMMIT SUICIDE AND THERE WERE THREE HOUR WAIT TIMES ON
THE DIFFERENCE WAS IF YOU TEXT US I WANT TO DIE OR I WANT TO KILL MYSELF THE ALGORITHM
41 ACTIVE RESCUES A DAY
EVERY TIME WE SEND OUT A TEXT MESSAGE WE GET BACK A FEW DOZEN TEXT MESSAGES HAVING
AND IN FOUR MONTHS WE WERE IN ALL 295 AREA CODES IN AMERICA
I HAVE A BOTTLE OF PILLS ON THE DESK IN FRONT OF ME
THEY'RE HAPPIER IN THEIR JOBS THEY WORK WELL WITH THEIR COLLEAGUES AND THEIR JOB PERFORMANCE IS BETTER THAN LOW EMOTIONALLY
WE MAY EVEN BE MARRIED TO ONE
NOW OBVIOUSLY FOR ANYBODY YOU PROBABLY DON'T THINK ABOUT THE PROCESS YOU GO THROUGH BUT THAT INVOLVES A LITTLE BIT
NOW MOST OF THAT EVIDENCE HAS BEEN GATHERED FROM PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDIES CARRIED OUT USING
AND NEXT TIME YOU GET INTO A CONFLICT SITUATION STOP THINK ABOUT HOW YOU FEEL
EVERYTHING WOULD BE WONDERFUL IF WE WERE ALL EMOTIONALLY INTELLIGENT
BUT IT GETS MUCH MORE INTERESTING
SO THE END JUSTIFIES THE MEANS FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS
I'VE HAD A GO AT THIS AND I CAN TELL YOU IT'S FUN AND REALLY CATHARTIC IF YOU'VE HAD A BAD DAY
AND YOU HAVE TO REGULATE AND CONTROL ANY PREPOTENT RESPONSE TO SAY PUNCH THE NASTY PERSON
HIGH EMOTIONALLY INTELLIGENT PEOPLE PERFORM WELL IN THEIR JOBS
BUT ALL OF THOSE RESPONSES ALTHOUGH THEY MAY SEEM VERY INSTINCTIVE DON'T ALWAYS
AND WHEN WE'VE LEARNED TO AUTHENTICALLY IDENTIFY WHAT WE'RE REALLY FEELING AND HOW IT
IT'S ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE AS WELL BECAUSE WHEN WE START TO REALLY UNDERSTAND EMOTION WE CAN START
AND YOU WERE EVEN ABLE TO ACTUALLY GET PREDICTIONS FROM WHAT IS HAPPENING THROUGH THIS ANALYSIS OF PUBLIC OPINION
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENTS WE THINK IN THAT RESPECT IS TO BE ABLE TO HARNESS
THEN WE TALKED ABOUT INDIVIDUAL INTELLIGENCE AND COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE
AND IN THE END I WILL GO TO THE MOST CRUCIAL QUESTION I THINK FOR TODAY
AND THEN CAME ROBOTS
AND THEY HAVE PARTIALLY PRODUCED SOME FRUIT
AND IF LIKE ME YOU PREFER YOUR RUGGED OUTDOOR ADVENTURE TEMPERED BY A NICE HOT SHOWER AND A CONVERSATION WITH FRIENDS AT
BUT IF YOU KILL ALL THE WOLVES THERE IS NO MORE POWER THERE IS NO MORE LUCK AND ULTIMATELY THERE IS NO MORE
THERE IS ONE CAMP THAT LOVES CARNIVORES AND WANTS THEM PROTECTED WITHOUT END FOREVER AND EVER ALL OF
THEY WERE KIND OF BLURRY AND KIND OF GROUCHY AND I SUGGESTED TO THEM THAT THEY MUST REALLY KIND OF HATE THE
I AM NOT MY FATHER
AND IT WOULDN'T BE AN EXAGGERATION TO SAY THAT 99
WHEN WE OSTRACIZE THE INNOCENT IT TEARS APART THE FABRIC OF OUR SOCIETY WHICH ONLY WORKS TO FORMAT THE NEXT
THEY WOULD NOT BE BROKEN BY THEM
REMEMBER THAT EXTREMISM THRIVES ON THE FRINGES OF SOCIETY
WHEN WE DIVIDE PEOPLE INTO SMALLER AND SMALLER GROUPS BASED ON ONE ARBITRARY DISTINCTION OR
INSTEAD OF AGGRESSIVELY PAYING IT DOWN SHE ONLY GOING TO PAY HER MINIMUM PAYMENTS
AMERICA IS STRUGGLING WITH OBESITY AND THIS IS A SHOW THAT BRINGS THAT TO THE FOREFRONT
THEN SHE'S GOING TO SPEND 1200 ON RENT
APPLYING THOSE EXACT SAME BEHAVIORAL TRAITS NOT LEARNING MUCH MORE ABOUT PERSONAL FINANCE MAKING A FEW MORE
I REALLY BELIEVE THAT WE CAN GO BACK TO THE TENS OF MILLIONS WE CAN ULTIMATELY GO BACK TO JESSICA AND
I WANT THAT FOR JESSICA
WE'RE IN A POSITION WHERE THE AMERICAN DREAM OF HOME OWNERSHIP IS NOT A REALITY AS 25 OF
THEY'LL GO OFF TO COLLEGE AND THEY'LL BE IN A SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER PLACE THAN JESSICA WAS DECADES AGO
WHY DO I HAVE TO WORRY SO MUCH
TO BIGGER THINGS LIKE WHAT SHOULD I DO WITH MY 401K
SO MEET JESSICA
THEY'RE ALL BUYING OFF THE SHELF STUFF
SO GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD HAVE BEEN EMBRACING THIS TECHNOLOGY
IN THE LAST YEAR OR SO THE COMPANY HAS OPENED A SALES OFFICE IN
I'VE BEEN STUDYING SURVEILLANCE FOR MORE THAN SIX YEARS
THE COMPANY HAS ALSO HIRED A SPOKESPERSON
THE 2011 ARAB SPRING CAPTURED THE ATTENTION OF THE WORLD
THEY'D SENT THEM AN INVOICE FOR A SALE BUT THE EGYPTIANS NEVER BOUGHT IT
AS I SAID IT'S A 5 BILLION INDUSTRY
I'M JUST GOING TO SPEED UP A LITTLE BIT
AND THAT WAS AN AMAZING THING
AND IF WE IDENTIFY WE DEVELOP EMPATHY
I DISCOVERED ACCESS TO MY UNCONSCIOUS MIND
SO IN THE 1960S I HAD ACCESS TO PRIVILEGE AND RESOURCES IN A WAY THAT MANY SOUTH AFRICANS
A FRIEND OF MINE SAID TO ME WHY DON'T YOU TRY THERAPY
IT'S OUT OF STYLE JUST AFTER A FEW MONTHS
I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR STARTING THE FIRST ONLINE UNIVERSITY OUTSIDE OF THE US IN EUROPE
IT'S THE OPPOSITE OF DEMOCRACY
SOMEBODY WORKED OUT EXACTLY WHICH PLANE SHE WAS ON SO THEY LINKED TO A FLIGHT TRACKER WEBSITE
BUT IT WAS WORSE THAN THAT
WE WERE ALL SO EXCITED ABOUT DESTROYING JUSTINE AND OUR SHAMING BRAINS ARE SO SIMPLE MINDED THAT WE
I FAVOR HUMANS OVER IDEOLOGY BUT RIGHT NOW THE IDEOLOGUES ARE WINNING AND THEY'RE
AND IF SOMEBODY GETS IN THE WAY WE SCREEN THEM OUT
PEOPLE WOULD ADMIT SHAMEFUL SECRETS ABOUT THEMSELVES AND OTHER PEOPLE WOULD SAY OH MY GOD I'M EXACTLY THE
YOU ARE THE WORLDWIDE NUMBER ONE TRENDING TOPIC ON TWITTER
AND SO TO HER SHAME SHE WROTE SHE SHUT UP AND WATCHED AS JUSTINE'S LIFE GOT
AS A TEACHER AND A MOM I CAN'T THINK OF MANY THINGS THAT MATTER AS MUCH AS READING ALOUD TO OUR KIDS
BECAUSE WHEN KIDS GO BACK TO THEIR OWN BOOKS THEY KNOW THAT WORLD SHOULD COME ALIVE IN THEIR BRAINS
AT SCHOOL AND AT HOME
SHE WHISPERED OH
AT ALL AGES
I COULD TRANSLATE OR DECODE THE WORDS BUT I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THEM OR THINK OR TALK ABOUT THEM
THE DECODING OF WORDS TAKES UP SO MUCH BRAIN ENERGY THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF BRAIN SPACE LEFT OVER TO ACTUALLY
SO WHEN I THINK BACK TO WHAT JOEY SAID TO ME ALL THOSE YEARS AGO MISS B
I FELT LIKE I WAS RIGHT THERE
LOOK AT HIM
WELL THE PIG IS SAVED AND LATER THAT MORNING FERN DISCOVERS A CARTON ON HER CHAIR AT BREAKFAST
ARABLE SAVED FROM AN UNTIMELY DEATH
WHAT'S SHIELDED ME FROM HATRED AND WANTING RETRIBUTION WHAT'S GIVEN
I SURRENDERED MY BODY TO THEM
DIFFERENCE OF ANY KIND MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO THE EXTRAORDINARY
AND WHEN WILL WE EMBRACE THE WISDOM OF OUR ERA
I HAD DONE ALL I POSSIBLY COULD AND NOW I WAS IN THEIR
I ELEVATED MY THIGHS
BUT MY PRIORITY AND MY FOCUS WAS ALWAYS MY WORK
I LIVED TO WORK
I LOVE TO STUDY THESE ANIMALS THAT BREAK THE RULES BECAUSE EVERY TIME THEY BREAK A RULE THEY INVENT SOMETHING NEW
HOW NARROW DO YOU ASK
AND WE HAVE THEM HERE TODAY
YOU'RE GOING TO DESICCATE OUT THERE
SO DAN DEMONSTRATES THE MANY SELF LEARNERS WHO TAKE THIS
AND YET WE DON'T TOLERATE MISTAKES AND WE WORSHIP GRADES
BUT GIVEN WHAT I NOW FEEL CAPABLE OF DOING I WOULD CERTAINLY DO IT AGAIN
THEY HAVE A TREMENDOUS PASSION TO LEARN
4 WHICH IS STAMPED ON YOUR FOREHEAD AND SUMS UP WHO YOU ARE
WE DON'T REPLACE TEACHERS BY THE WAY
TO ANYONE CONSIDERING NAND2TETRIS IT'S A TOUGH JOURNEY BUT YOU'LL BE PROFOUNDLY CHANGED
SO I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU A STORY ABOUT A SELF STUDY SELF EMPOWERING COMPUTER SCIENCE
OR A MAC WHICH IS SHROUDED BY NUMEROUS LAYERS OF CLOSED PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE
I NEVER WORKED HARDER ON ANYTHING NEVER BEEN CHALLENGED TO THIS DEGREE
BUT THERE'S ANOTHER WORLD TOO
AND IT WAS THE SAME EVERYWHERE
AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS JIHAD MY SACRED DUTY WHICH WOULD BE REWARDED BY GOD
I CONFUSED TRUE JIHAD WITH THIS PERVERSION AS PRESENTED BY THE FASCIST
IT HAS BEEN PERVERTED TO MEAN VIOLENT STRUGGLE WHEREVER MUSLIMS ARE UNDERGOING DIFFICULTIES
SO I BECAME INVOLVED IN THE JIHAD IN AFGHANISTAN
I WANTED TO PROTECT THE MUSLIM AFGHAN POPULATION AGAINST THE SOVIET ARMY
AND DOES THE AID DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD
IT IS SIMPLY A TOOL THAT AID ORGANIZATIONS NEED TO USE IN ORDER TO GET ACCESS TO PEOPLE MOST IN
SINCE THE 9 11 MANY AID ORGANIZATIONS HAVE REJECTED
RWANDA REALLY WAS EXCEPTIONAL THESE CAMPS
AND I THINK IF AID ORGANIZATIONS RATHER THAN JUST PAYING LIP SERVICE TO SOME OF THE HUMANITARIAN PRINCIPLES AT THE
FROM THESE 1980S OF TAKING SIDES IN CONFLICT WAS THAT OFTEN THE WARRIORS THAT WE CELEBRATE
NO AID ORGANIZATION IS ABLE TO SAY THAT 100 OF THEIR AID CAN GET
AND IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME AID ORGANIZATIONS HAVE DONE THIS
SO IT'S CERTAINLY NOT A NEW THING BUT ONE OF THE LESSONS
BUT THAT DOES NOT ABSOLVE HUMANITARIAN AID ORGANIZATIONS FROM BEING VERY SERIOUS
ON THE ONE HAND THEY TEND TO LAMENT THIS INSTRUMENTALIZATION OF AID IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES BUT IN OTHERS
AND SO THERE ARE TWO THINGS I THINK THAT AID ORGANIZATIONS REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT TODAY
WE BELIEVE VERY MUCH VERY STRONGLY THAT IT IS BETTER TO TAKE THE RISK THAT A WOUNDED SOLDIER WHO'S BEEN REPAIRED
ALL THE TIME HE'S BEEN DOING 65 MILES PER HOUR DOWN THE FREEWAY
WE JUST REDUCED ACCIDENTS ON OUR ROADS BY A FACTOR OF TWO
SO BACK IN 2013 WE HAD THE FIRST TEST OF A SELF DRIVING CAR WHERE WE LET REGULAR PEOPLE
EVERY ONE OF THEM TOLD US THEY LOVED IT
WHAT ARE WE THINKING
SOME ATTRIBUTE THIS GOLDEN WORLD KNOWLEDGE TO PLATO OTHERS TO PYTHAGORAS
WOULD YOU GET A DIVORCE
THE FIRST ONE IS TOASTMASTERS
IT DOES NOT REALLY MATTER WHY YOU ARE
THERE ARE TWO PROGRAMS THAT I'M A PART OF THAT HAVE HELPED ME LEARN SOME SOCIAL SKILLS AND I
ASPERGER'S SYNDROME IS A DISORDER ON THE MILD END OF THE AUTISM SPECTRUM AND ITS MOST
IF I HAVE IT IN MY MIND THAT SOMETHING IS SUPPOSED TO BE A CERTAIN WAY AND IT DOES NOT
I AM DIFFERENT
THEN YOU SELL A LOT MORE
THEY DID NOT MAKE IT TO UNIVERSITY
EVEN IN SALES
LET ME ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS TO SEE IF THIS IS A GOOD CHOICE
ANOTHER GROUP SIMILARLY FOUND AUTOMATIC RESPONSES TO BEAUTY WITHIN OUR PLEASURE
WITHIN THE ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX THERE'S OVERLAPPING NEURAL ACTIVITY IN RESPONSE TO
OR HOW COULD WE HAVE BETTER PREPARED FOR THAT
IF I ASKED YOU TO THINK OF THE IDEAS OF AL QAEDA THAT'S SOMETHING THAT COMES TO YOUR MIND IMMEDIATELY
AND THEN YOU HAVE A THIRD PARTY SAYING VOTE FOR US WE'LL ESTABLISH A THEOCRACY
BUT GENERALLY THE TRENDS THAT START IN EGYPT HAVE HISTORICALLY SPREAD ACROSS THE MENA REGION THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA REGION
AT THE AGE OF 19 I WAS ON THE NATIONAL LEADERSHIP OF THIS ORGANIZATION IN THE U
THEY'RE TRANSNATIONAL AND THEY BOND AROUND THESE IDEAS AND NARRATIVES AND THESE SYMBOLS AND THESE LEADERS
WHEREAS IF WE START BUILDING THIS DEMAND ON THE GROUND ON A CIVILIZATIONAL LEVEL RATHER THAN MERELY ON A POLITICAL LEVEL A LEVEL
LET'S BRING THE MILITARY BACK AGAIN
IT DOESN'T REALLY WORK
SO THE IDEAS AND THE NARRATIVES OF AL QAEDA COME TO YOUR MIND IMMEDIATELY
AND IT'S WITH THAT THOUGHT THAT I'LL END
IF I ASK YOU TO THINK OF THEIR NARRATIVES THE WEST BEING AT WAR WITH ISLAM THE NEED TO DEFEND ISLAM AGAINST THE WEST THESE
SO DEMOCRACY HAS BECOME MERELY ONE POLITICAL CHOICE AMONG MANY OTHER FORMS OF POLITICAL CHOICES
AND THEN PEOPLE SAY WE'VE TRIED DEMOCRACY
WE FELT THAT THEY WERE OUT OF DATE
BUT ACTUALLY IT'S MY BELIEF THAT THE PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN TRULY CAPITALIZING ON THIS AGE OF BEHAVIOR UP UNTIL NOW UP UNTIL
AND I WAS ACTUALLY A POTENT FORCE IN SPREADING IDEAS ACROSS BORDERS AND I WITNESSED THE RISE OF ISLAMIST
WE NEED TO MOVE ONE STEP BEYOND THAT NOW
AND THEY SAID WE'RE WAITING FOR JUSTIN HE'S IN A WHEELCHAIR WE WANT TO GET HIM OVER THIS MOUNTAIN PASS
AND SOME LIVES TRIUMPH IN THE FACE OF THAT ADVERSITY AND SOME LIVES DON'T
WHO KNOWS WHY THESE PEOPLE DID WHAT THEY DID TO HELP ME
AND THEY SAID ALL RIGHT WE'LL STOP
SO I WON'T SAY THAT WE WERE COCKY WE WERE FEELING REALLY CONFIDENT BECAUSE WE'D JUST COME OVER THE PYRENEES
HAVE ANY OF YOU EVER HAD A CHALLENGE THAT'S SO GREAT THAT YOU KNEW THERE WAS NO WAY YOU COULD ACCOMPLISH IT ON YOUR OWN
BUT BEFORE WE DO THAT I WANT TO KIND OF GET YOU UP TO SPEED ON WHAT WE ACTUALLY DID THIS PAST SUMMER
THERE IS A CATHEDRAL THAT WE ENDED AT
IT DIVIDED AND IT'S REMAINED DIVIDED EVER SINCE
I MEAN TAKE THE QUESTION OF EAST ASIA
AND THAT IS HOW MUCH MORE WE VALUE THE BODY THAN WE DO THE MIND
I BELIEVE OUR QUALITY OF LIFE COULD RISE JUST AS DRAMATICALLY IF WE ALL BEGAN PRACTICING
I STUMBLED OUT OF BED I PUT THE PHONE BACK ON THE RECEIVER AND IT RANG A SECOND LATER AND IT WAS MY
OUR MIND IS HARD TO CHANGE ONCE WE BECOME CONVINCED
I WAS IN THE GRIPS OF REAL LONELINESS BACK THEN BUT I WAS SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE ALL DAY SO IT
HE WAS STANDING ON A STOOL BY THE SINK BRUSHING HIS TEETH WHEN HE SLIPPED AND SCRATCHED HIS
HE CRIED FOR A MINUTE BUT THEN HE GOT BACK UP GOT BACK ON THE STOOL AND REACHED OUT FOR A BOX OF
WE'VE KNOWN IT SINCE WE WERE FIVE YEARS OLD
NOT AMONG THE CORE VALUES OF THE EUROPEAN PROJECT
I SAIL THE WORLD
BUT THEN THE FOLLOW UP QUESTION
THIS IS SO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TO OTHER TV PROGRAMMING
YOU RIG THEM AND YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING
NOT MUCH DRAMA
IT'S LIKE A SPORTS EVENT
SO WE DECIDED OUR NEXT PROJECT IT SHOULD BE LIVE
THERE IS NO STORY LINE NO SCRIPT NO DRAMA NO CLIMAX AND IT'S CALLED SLOW
SO HE SAID WHY DON'T WE MAKE A RADIO PROGRAM MARKING THE DAY OF THE GERMAN INVASION OF NORWAY IN
SO WE CALLED OUR COMMISSIONING EDITORS IN OSLO AND WE SAID WE WANT TO MAKE A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT THE BERGEN RAILWAY
YOUR GRANDFATHER BUILT IT AS THE FIRST HOUSE IN NORTH ALNUZHA
AND WE WERE AMONG THE FORTUNATE FEW TO BE ABLE TO BOARD A PLANE ONTO SAFER GROUND
IT MATTERS BECAUSE AS A RESULT OF THAT PARTICULAR MOMENT IN 1948 HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF
SO IN IT HE WRITES HI TAMARA HOW ARE YOU
AND THERE IS A DARK SIDE TO ALL OF THESE STORIES AND MYTHS THAT CAN BE REALLY DAMAGING
IF THAT STORY MAKES US FEEL GOOD ABOUT OURSELVES THEN SO MUCH THE BETTER
BECAUSE IT'S NOT ALL IN THE PAST
WE WRITE BOOKS ABOUT IT WE WRITE NOVELS ABOUT IT WE MAKE FILMS ABOUT IT
IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY QUITE INSPIRING
WHAT THEY REALLY WANT IS A MYTH
AND HER BABY WILL RECEIVE PMTCT WHICH WILL MEAN THAT THAT BABY CAN BE BORN FREE OF THE
SO IT WAS OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A VERY EMOTIONAL ENCOUNTER AND LEFT US FEELING VERY RESONANT WITH THIS
SING CAMPAIGN IS BASICALLY JUST ME AND ABOUT THREE OR FOUR WONDERFUL PEOPLE WHO HELP TO SUPPORT ME
NOW THAT IS PREVENTION AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF LIFE
THE MESSAGE THAT UNAIDS ARE CURRENTLY SENDING OUT TO THE WORLD IS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE VIRTUAL
I HAVE TO SERVE
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE IN THE CLOSET
I BECAME A MEMBER OF TREATMENT ACTION CAMPAIGN AND I'M VERY PROUD TO BE A MEMBER OF THAT INCREDIBLE
WE'RE DOING THAT NOW WITH OUR DESIGN CHALLENGES
COULD COMPANIES ACTUALLY STOP COMPETING WITH EACH OTHER BUT COOPERATE
SO WHAT CAN YOU DO
WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE
WE UNDERSTAND THE HAZARDS OF 1 OF THEM
HOW DOES NATURE CROSSLINK
THAT'S WHAT YOU DESCRIBED RIGHT
MY IGNORANT ARROGANT COARSENESS MY SECRET PRIDE MY TURNING
ALWAYS THAT EROTIC MURMUR I'M HARDLY MYSELF IF I'M NOT IN A STATE OF
I DON'T MEAN THAT FOR A MOMENT
SO WHY IS THIS
HE'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE PEOPLE
AND I DON'T MEAN SPANKING
HE'S SERVED SEVERAL TOURS IN AFGHANISTAN
BUT THE TROUBLE IS YOU ONLY HAVE THREE AND IF YOU GIVE UP ALL THREE REMINDER STICKS YOU HAVE TO SIT OUT
I READ A STUDY THAT ASKED LITTLE CHILDREN WHAT WORRIES THEM MOST
IS JACK WORRIED ABOUT BEING HIT
AND THOSE INSIGHTS CAN BE YOURS
HE CHOSE TO NO LONGER FEEL HUNGRY AGAIN
THE NEXT DAY THEY DIDN'T BEAT HIM EITHER OR THE NEXT DAY
NEXT HE FOCUSED ON THE BEATINGS
SO ULTIMATELY WHEN I LOOK IT BACK AT WHAT DOING TO SHANGHAI DID TO ME 12 YEARS AGO WHAT HAPPENED IS I
AND THE HUNGER WENT
WHAT ARE YOU CURIOUS ABOUT
I WENT IN AND BOUGHT POINT SIX TWO
IN THE END HE CHOSE TO NO LONGER BE SCARED AFTER ALL THEY WERE GOING TO BEAT HIM ANYWAY WHY BE SCARED
THEY BEAT EVERYONE ELSE BUT HIM
I HAVEN'T TRIED IT
YOU'RE SO BRAVE TO BE GOING AWAY TO CHINA TO GIVE UP YOUR JOB IN ENGLAND AND SO ON BUT HONESTLY I DIDN'T FEEL
YOU MEET PEOPLE
AND YOU FIND THE FREEDOM TO TRY NEW THINGS AND TO DO NEW THINGS WHICH YOU WOULDN'T HAVE OTHERWISE
AND HOW COLD THE WATER IS
BECAUSE IF THEY HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL AT FISHING THEY WOULD ONLY NEED ONE OR TWO DIVES THEY'D DIVE IN THEY'D CATCH A
ITS PAWS ARE NOT WELL ADAPTED TO PADDLING
SO ON ONE HAND THAT TELLS US THAT THEY'RE VERY VERY WELL ADAPTED TO HANDLING COLD TEMPERATURES
ALL OF THESE ANIMALS ARE SUPREMELY ADAPTABLE THEY'RE VERSATILE THEY'RE RESILIENT THEY DO
IT DOESN'T TELL US THAT MUCH ABOUT PARTICULAR BEHAVIORS APART FROM THE FACT THAT AN ANIMAL WAS
NOW THE EUROPEAN ENVIRONMENT AGENCY ESTIMATES THAT THE ECONOMIC LOSSES CAUSED BY
OK SO LET'S BEGIN
THERE ARE BIRDS EVERYWHERE
RAISE YOUR HANDS
SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS LIKE YOU WORK HARD EVERY DAY RIGHT
HE USED TO SAY TO ME
WHAT COULD WE ACTUALLY DO
AND THEN BECAUSE WE KNOW WE'VE GOT VEGETABLE TOURISTS AND WE LOVE THEM TO BITS AND THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC WE THOUGHT WHAT COULD WE DO TO GIVE
SO WE DID SOME REALLY SIMPLE THINGS
CAN WE FIND THAT LANGUAGE
THEY WANT POSITIVE ACTIONS THEY CAN ENGAGE IN AND IN THEIR BONES THEY KNOW IT'S TIME TO TAKE PERSONAL
IT'S NOT ABOUT SELLING SOAP THERE IS A LARGER PURPOSE OUT THERE
TAKE ANOTHER EXAMPLE I WAS WALKING AROUND IN ONE OF OUR VILLAGES IN INDIA
THIS IS DUE TO THE LACK OF CEREBRAL LATERALIZATION IN THE BRAIN WHICH IS FOR ANOTHER WORDS LANGUAGE
SO PRETTY MUCH ALL OF US
IT'S TO ALLOW THE WHOLE WORLD TO ENTER OUR KITCHEN
SO FOR ME THE SENTENCE WE ARE WHAT WE EAT IS A VERY LITERAL ONE
AND TILL TODAY WHEN I AM HUNGRY I DON'T HAVE MICHELIN STARS FANTASIES ABOUT
WHEN I'M HUNGRY I'M THINKING
BY 2020 THEY WILL ACCOUNT FOR OVER 50 PERCENT OF ALL DIGITAL INFORMATION
HUMAN CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION HAVE ALWAYS PROPELLED US FORWARD
IT MAKES PRODUCTS MORE AFFORDABLE
AND THE EDUCATION SYSTEM WILL NEED TO EVOLVE TO ENSURE STUDENTS ARE EQUIPPED WITH THE RIGHT SKILLS
OVER THE PAST 200 YEARS THE WORLD HAS EXPERIENCED TWO MAJOR WAVES OF INNOVATION
IT'S THE MARRIAGE OF MINDS AND MACHINES
THEY'VE RAISED LIVING STANDARDS
THEY SAY THAT ALL THE GROWTH ENHANCING INNOVATIONS ARE BEHIND US
SHE ALREADY HAS ALL THE SPARE PARTS BECAUSE THE PROBLEMS WERE DIAGNOSED IN ADVANCED
WE WILL NEED A ROBUST CYBERSECURITY APPROACH THAT PROTECTS SENSITIVE INFORMATION AND INTELLECTUAL
THEY'VE CREATED JOBS
IT CREATES NEW DEMAND NEW JOBS
AND BELIEVE ME AS AN ECONOMIST I AM ALSO SCARED
IT MEANS MORE PATIENTS CAN BE TREATED MORE LIVES CAN BE SAVED
WHY DOES ANY OF THIS MATTER AT ALL
BY THE TIME IT LANDS THEY WILL ALREADY KNOW IF ANYTHING NEEDS TO BE SERVICED
BUT DON'T FRET THERE ARE RESOURCES FOR ALL THESE THINGS
IF YOU GO TO TED
SO IT'S A NICE THING TO HAVE
I SEE THEM PUT TOGETHER SELF HELP GROUPS
I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE PROGRAMS ARE
I SEE THEM STRIVING TO BE BETTER
I SEE THE REHAB
I SEE THEM PUT TOGETHER WORK GROUPS
THAT WAY WHEN YOU DEAL WITH AN INMATE YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE COMING FROM BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY DEAL WITH RESPECT
I'VE GOT A GOOD MEMORY
I WANT TO GO HOME THE SAME WAY I CAME TO WORK
I WAS IN RECEIVING AND RELEASING ONE DAY WORKING OVERTIME AND THERE WAS AN INMATE HE WAS PACING BACK AND FORTH
YOU JUST HAD TEAMS OF HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE
I NEED TO THINK ABOUT THIS MORE
AND UNFORTUNATELY AFTER THINKING ABOUT THIS FOR SOME TIME I IDENTIFIED THE MAIN OBSTACLE
AND SO I BEGAN TO RACK MY BRAIN TRYING TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WAS THE PROCESS THAT I WAS DOING
SOMETIMES IT CAN TAKE TWO YEARS TO TYPE THAT INFORMATION INTO A COMPUTER AND SOMETIMES ACTUALLY NOT INFREQUENTLY
NOW 1995 OBVIOUSLY THAT WAS QUITE A LONG TIME AGO
NOW WE KNEW WHEN WE BUILT THIS SYSTEM THE WHOLE POINT OF IT JUST LIKE WITH THE PALMPILOTS WAS THAT YOU'D BE
SO THESE GUYS ARE DISTRIBUTING TECHNOLOGY GETTING SOFTWARE CAPACITY OUT THERE BUT THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY FLYING AROUND THE WORLD
AS FAR AS I KNEW THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD DISTRIBUTE TECHNOLOGY AND I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT A WAY AROUND IT
THAT'S LESS THAN I USED TO GET JUST TRAVELING OUT FOR TWO WEEKS TO DO A CONSULTATION
HOW WAS I TRAINING FOLKS AND WHAT WERE THE BOTTLENECKS AND WHAT WERE THE OBSTACLES TO DOING IT FASTER AND TO
WHILE I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT PEOPLE STARTED USING EVEN MORE THINGS LIKE THIS JUST AS WE WERE
IT'S ALWAYS GUYS THAT LOOK PRETTY MUCH LIKE ME FLYING FROM COUNTRIES THAT LOOK PRETTY MUCH LIKE THIS TO OTHER
AND YOU GO OUT THERE AND YOU SPEND MONEY ON AIRFARE AND YOU SPEND TIME AND YOU SPEND PER DIEM AND YOU
NOW TRY AND WRAP YOUR HEAD AROUND THAT FOR A SECOND
AND WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT IS ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT WE'RE GENERATING THROUGH OUR INTERACTION WITH AND OVER THE INTERNET
WE DON'T KNOW AND THIS IS REALLY AMAZING TO ME WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY CHILDREN WERE BORN OR
WE HAVE PAPER FORMS TO TRACK PEOPLE WHO COME INTO CLINICS
BUT SOCIAL IS NOT AN APP
AND YOU SAID WHAT MESSAGE ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
SO ASSUMING THAT THE PERSON THAT WISHES TO KNOW YOU ARE CANNOT WATCH THE ENTIRE INTERNET ALL AT THE SAME
SOMETIMES IT WORKS QUITE WELL SOMETIMES YOU JUST CAN'T CONNECT
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AUTONOMY
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE UNDERSTAND THIS AND YET EUROPE HAS MANDATORY DATA RETENTION NOT JUST FOR PHONE CALL RELATED STUFF
BUT AS IT JUST SO HAPPENS THE INTERESTING NOTION HERE IS THIS IDEA THAT SOMEHOW BECAUSE YOU DON'T SHOW IT TO SOMEONE
WHERE SURVEILLANCE IS OFTEN IN SUPPORT OF AUTHORITARIANISM AND SPECIFICALLY IN SUPPORT OF VIOLENCE
AND YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO HIDE AND SO ON
I COME AT THIS FROM THE HUMAN RIGHTS PERSPECTIVE
BECAUSE IT DIS EMPOWERS PEOPLE WHO ARE OTHERWISE TOTALLY LITERATE
SO IT'S NICE BECAUSE IT CAN HELP DISPEL THAT NOTION
AND THE IDEA IS TO COMPARTMENTALIZE THIS BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE TO TRUST ONE AGENCY TO NEVER BETRAY YOU THAT MEANS
AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE ABILITY FOR EACH OF US TO DEVELOP AS A HUMAN WITHOUT THAT
IN FACT MOST OF US PROBABLY ALREADY CAN TELL THAT STORY
THAT'S KIND OF STRANGE
AND THE TECHNOLOGY WAS VERY FASCINATING TO ME
BUT IN SOME PARTS OF THE WORLD THIS IS EXTREMELY RADICAL THIS NOTION THAT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO SPEAK FREELY THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE
AND WHAT IS THAT EXACTLY
SO URANIUM WHICH IS VERY BIG WANTS TO SPLIT
BUT THAT'S NOT ELECTRICITY YET
YOU GET THEM CLOSER AND CLOSER AND CLOSER AND THEN AT SOME POINT THE STRONG FORCE GRIPS THEM TOGETHER
IT'S A MEDIUM SIZED NUCLEUS
AND YOU CAN GET ENERGY OUT THIS WAY
I WISH WE HAD MORE MONEY I WISH WE HAD MORE RESOURCES
BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY FUSION POWER
THIS IS A BIT SHOCKING BECAUSE IN FACT OUR GOVERNMENT IS RELYING ON THAT FOR US TO MEET KYOTO AND DO ALL THOSE KIND OF
WE REALLY NEED IT NOW
AND IT'S THIS REACTION THAT WE WANT TO DO
IT'S PRETTY HOT
AND YOU WANT TO GO TOWARDS IRON IF YOU WANT TO GET ENERGY
BUT THERE IS A CATCH
WE'VE BEEN TRYING FOR 50 YEARS
IT'S NOT CLIMATE LARGELY WHICH HAS GOT RID OF THE WORLD'S MEGAFAUNAS
AND THEY MAKE IN MY VIEW A POWERFUL CASE FOR THE REINTRODUCTION OF MISSING
THE WOLVES KILLED COYOTES AND AS A RESULT OF THAT THE NUMBER OF RABBITS AND MICE
RAVENS AND BALD EAGLES CAME DOWN TO FEED ON THE CARRION THAT THE WOLVES HAD LEFT
REWILDING TO ME MEANS BRINGING BACK SOME OF THE MISSING PLANTS AND ANIMALS
ONE THING THAT PEOPLE I THINK OFTEN MISS IS THAT THESE KINDS OF LEAPS GENERATE COMPOUNDING GAINS
SO WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DECELERATE THE PLANE FROM ABOUT 100 KILOMETERS AN HOUR TO ZERO IN HALF OF A SECOND
OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS AS WE START SERVING PRIVATE HEALTH CARE FACILITIES WE'LL ALSO USE THAT MOBILE PAYMENT PLATFORM
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO CHANGE
SO THEY GET IT
SO I WAS ASKING EARLIER WHO IS GOING TO BE CREATING THE DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY
AND I DO MEAN EAST AFRICA NOT JUST RWANDA
BUT BLOOD IS ALSO CHALLENGING BECAUSE IT HAS A VERY SHORT SHELF LIFE THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT
THEY ENDED UP SENDING SEVEN UNITS OF RED BLOOD CELLS FOUR UNITS OF PLASMA AND TWO UNITS OF PLATELETS
AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT OUR AUTONOMOUS FLEET OF VEHICLES RELIES ON THAT CELLULAR NETWORK
A MAN WALKS DOWN A ROAD
I WAS IMMEDIATELY GRIPPED BY THE MAGICAL AND FAIRY TALE QUALITIES OF THE SUBJECT
WHERE DOES THE PERSISTENCE COME FROM
A TERRORIST ATTACK
THE POLICE ISSUED A PREMATURE PUBLIC STATEMENT THAT MORNING ECHOING HIS CLAIMS WITHOUT BOTHERING TO QUESTION IT OR FURTHER
THERE WAS NO ARGUMENT
THAT'S ALL WE KNOW
SOMETHING IN ME JUST KNOWS
AS THEY BEGAN TO EAT THEY HEARD A KNOCK ON THE DOOR
AND I WAS LIKE
YOU SAY HELLO
IF YOU ARE A STIFF VESSEL THE MAGIC THE EMOTION WILL NOT COME OUT
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MANY YEARS MY SON COULD GO TO A FOOTBALL GAME AND BE SAFE WITHOUT ME
KIDS ARE AMAZINGLY RESILIENT
I'M DAMN GOOD AT MY JOB
THE KIDS STARTED WATCHING THE GAME
AND I WAS NO LONGER AT A FOOTBALL GAME
I NEVER HAD TWO SONS
I WORRY ABOUT NICOLE AND HER FRIENDS' SAFETY EVERY DAY
I'M A SAFETY PROFESSIONAL
I'M A NATIONALLY KNOWN INCIDENT COMMAND INSTRUCTOR
I WANTED THE STORY INSIDE THE BOOK
IT'S THE IDEA THAT I DON'T NECESSARILY WANT A HAND DRILL
WELL THIS IDEA IS TAKING OFF IN OUR PEER CITIES LIKE WASHINTON D
THE IDEA BEHIND THE LIBRARY IS SOMETHING CALLED COLLABORATIVE CONSUMPTION
I WANT A HOLE IN THE WALL
SO MY THOUGHT IS WHY DON'T WE TAKE THIS IDEA AND EXTEND IT TO TRANSPORTATION
ATLANTA BOSTON MINNEAPOLIS PLACES LIKE THAT WHERE THIS IDEA SUCCEEDS BECAUSE IT BRINGS PEOPLE
AFTER ALL I WANT TO GET SOMEWHERE
IT'S THE IDEA THAT I GET ALL THE BENEFIT OF THE BICYLE WITHOUT ANY OF THE HASSLE OF THE OWNERSHIP BEHIND IT
SO WHY FARGO AND WHY NOW
AND NO REACHING ACROSS THE TABLE FOR ANY FOOD ITEM
EVERY FIBER OF MY BODY IS TIGHT
IT'S NOT A SUITCASE
AND OF COURSE MY FATHER WORKED HARD
I LEARNED MORE ABOUT HOW TO USE COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL STRATEGIES WITHOUT THE BRIBES AND IT TRANSFORMED THE WAY I
I TOLD MYSELF THAT PUBLIC SPEAKING JUST WASN'T MY THING AND THAT THAT WAS OK
AFRAID OF SPIDERS
LIFE WENT AS AS IT DOES AND ELI BECAME FASCINATED BY HISTORY
WE DID LOTS OF PLANNING
AND GRADUALLY HIS FEARS ABATED
IF THE CHILD'S SO TO SPEAK HAS TO RUN THE GAUNTLET THE THREAT OF SUCH BULLYING THAT CHILD'S NOT FREE
SECOND THING WE NEED APART FROM PROTECTION OF MINORITIES WE ALSO NEED THE PROTECTION OF MAJORITIES
IT'S DEPENDENT ON THE WILL OF THE AUTOCRAT
AND THAT'S THE FOLLOWING
WE NEED THREE THINGS AT LEAST BEYOND THAT
SO FOR EXAMPLE OF COURSE IT ARISES IN THE HOME
I THINK THAT GOES WITHOUT SAYING BUT WE NEED MORE THAN THAT TOO
YOU'VE GOT TO SHARE EQUALLY IN CONTROLLING THAT LAW
THE PRICE OF LIBERTY AS IT USED TO BE SAID IS ETERNAL VIGILANCE
AND WHILE YOU'RE UNDER THE WILL OF ANOTHER A COUNTRY IN THIS CASE UNDER THE WILL OF ANOTHER COUNTRY YOU CAN'T BE
AND IN ORDER TO INTRODUCE IT LET ME TALK ABOUT A PLAY THAT MANY OF YOU WILL KNOW IT'S A
I'M IN THIS CORNER OF SOCIETY THE GOVERNMENT ALWAYS STRIKES AT US
WELL OF COURSE WE NEED AN ELECTORAL DEMOCRACY
THIS WE OFTEN ACHIEVE THOUGH OUR NGOS WHICH HAVE SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART IN OUR CIVIC LIFE
SAME IS TRUE IF AN ELITE CONTROLS THE GOVERNMENT
AND THAT ACTUALLY IS PROBABLY THE MAIN THEME IN THE COMPLAINTS OF THE AMERICANS IN THE LAST
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
AN INSTANCE OF THAT FOR EXAMPLE IS THE LAW IS REPRESENTED IN THE POLICE
EVEN IF THE BULLYING DOESN'T OCCUR
SHE CAN GO TO THE THEATER OR NOT JUST AS SHE WISHES
THE PROBLEM IS THAT WHILE NORA IS UNRESTRICTED WHILE SHE'S NOT INTERFERED WITH IN THE
A DOMINOS AS IT USED TO BE CALLED SHE IS DOMINATED IN THAT SENSE OR SUBORDINATED OR SUBJECTED
PUBLIC FREEDOM THAT I'VE JUST BEEN TALKING ABOUT MEANS FREEDOM MEANS CONTROL MEANS
BUT WHAT IF HE WORKED IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
IT COULDN'T DO ANYTHING THAT YOUR SMARTPHONE DOES
PEOPLE DON'T BUILD ANYTHING THIS WAY
WE DON'T HAVE ANY DISEASE FIGHTING NANOBOTS THERE'S NO ELEVATORS TO SPACE AND THE THING THAT I'M MOST INTERESTED
LET'S JUST FIGURE OUT WHAT'S MISSING
I DON'T BUILD WITH STONE I BUILD WITH NANOMATERIALS
WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE BLAZING FAST COMPUTERS USING NANOMATERIALS
AND THE ANSWER IS THAT THE STATUE HAS TO BUILD ITSELF
SO BECAUSE OF THAT ALL OF THE PROMISE AND ALL OF THE EXCITEMENT HAS REMAINED JUST THAT PROMISE AND EXCITEMENT
SO OUR GROUP'S ROLE AND OUR GROUP'S MISSION IS TO INNOVATE BY EMPLOYING CARBON NANOTUBES BECAUSE WE THINK THAT
YOU WOULD NOT BE IMPRESSED
AND IT'S THIS CONVERGENCE THAT GIVES US THIS INCREDIBLE PACE
THIS IDEAL SOLUTION CONTAINS A MATERIAL THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO WORK WITH
WHAT ARE WE NOT DEALING WITH
WHAT ARE WE NOT DOING BUT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO MAKE THIS A SUCCESS
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE DONE IN OUR LAB
THE PROGRESS IS RELENTLESS
NOW THAT LAST ONE THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT ONE
WE JUST HAVE COME TO EXPECT THE PACE OF COMPUTING ADVANCEMENTS TO GO ON INDEFINITELY
NOW AS ODD AS THAT SOUNDS THAT IS ALMOST EXACTLY THE PROBLEM I WORK ON IN MY LAB
WE JUST DON'T BUILD ANYTHING THIS WAY
I MEAN EVERY LAST DROP
SHE'S BEEN THERE FOR HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF YEARS
WHEN I WAS A GRADUATE STUDENT IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING TIMES TO BE WORKING IN NANOTECHNOLOGY
THERE WERE SCIENTIFIC BREAKTHROUGHS HAPPENING ALL THE TIME
IT'S LIKE IN THE GODFATHER RIGHT
HE SAID WELL LOOK AT IT
I LIKE IT WHEN MY CHARACTERS SURPRISE ME
SOME PEOPLE CRITICIZED OTHERS PRAISED ME FOR WRITING ABOUT THE TURKISH ARMENIAN CONFLICT
OUR NEIGHBORHOOD WAS FULL OF LARGE FAMILIES WHERE FATHERS WERE THE HEADS OF HOUSEHOLDS SO I GREW UP
WHEN IDENTITY POLITICS TRIES TO PUT LABELS ON US IT IS OUR FREEDOM OF IMAGINATION THAT IS IN
THE OTHER RECOGNIZES NO FRONTIERS
ONE DRAWS BOUNDARIES
IT WAS JUST A STORY
AND THIS IS WHAT I DISCOVERED IN BOSTON THAT FRUSTRATION WAS VERY STIMULATING
I ASKED HER HOW SHE DID THIS
WHAT SHE DIDN'T KNOW WAS THAT I THOUGHT MY LIFE WAS TERRIBLY BORING AND THE LAST THING I WANTED TO DO WAS TO WRITE
I WATCHED THE MAN OPEN A PACK OF CIGARETTES WITH TREMBLING
ARE YOU READING AN INTERVIEW BY AN AUTHOR
IT THREATENS THE FLOW OF LOVE
NOT JUST ARE WE ABSENT FROM IT BUT SO IS EVERYONE ELSE
WITHOUT IT WE WOULD HAVE NO MUSIC
FIND OTHER BOOKS EXACTLY LIKE HIS
ATTENTION IS TIME
IT CANNOT BE STORED
AND THEREIN LIES ITS GREATEST CONVENIENCE AND HORROR
BUT THESE WERE NOT THE MAJOR PREOCCUPATIONS OF MY DAY
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THAT ARROW GOES AWRY
I WASN'T THE ONLY ONE
WE MIGHT RUN UP THE STAIRS TOO QUICKLY AND WE MIGHT GET BREATHLESS
IT'S THE WHOLE BOOK
I DON'T BELIEVE IN GOD
I MEAN THE DAY REMAINED BRIGHT
YOU MIGHT CHASE SOMETHING ELSE
UNFORTUNATELY FEW AMERICANS HAVE SEEN ONE BECAUSE IT'S BEEN 38 YEARS SINCE ONE LAST TOUCHED THE
BUT IT GOT MY ATTENTION AND SO I DID SOME RESEARCH
WELL THE DAY OF THE ECLIPSE FOUND US AND MANY OTHER PEOPLE OUT BEHIND THE HYATT REGENCY ON THE BEACH
I'M A SCIENCE WRITER
IN OTHER WORDS IT'S SCHEDULING A LITTLE TIMELINE OF THINGS YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO ON THE SCREEN
IT'S THE CLASSIC RACE TO THE BOTTOM WHEN YOU HAVE TO GET ATTENTION AND IT'S SO TENSE
WHAT WOULD BE THE PERFECT TIMELINE THAT MIGHT INCLUDE SOMETHING LATER WOULD BE TIME WELL SPENT FOR YOU HERE AT TED IN YOUR LAST DAY HERE
IT'S ONLY ACCOUNTABLE TO MAXIMIZING ATTENTION
SO LET ME GIVE YOU A CONCRETE EXAMPLE
I STUDIED AT A LAB CALLED THE PERSUASIVE TECHNOLOGY LAB AT STANFORD THAT TAUGHT STUDENTS HOW TO RECOGNIZE EXACTLY THESE TECHNIQUES
YOU OPEN UP FACEBOOK
THERE'S CONFERENCES AND WORKSHOPS THAT TEACH PEOPLE ALL THESE COVERT WAYS OF GETTING PEOPLE'S ATTENTION AND ORCHESTRATING
AND SO WHAT DO YOU DO IN THAT MOMENT
THE FIRST IS WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE ARE PERSUADABLE
LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF SNAPCHAT
IT'S PROBABLY OK
AND IF YOU'RE THE FACEBOOK NEWSFEED WHETHER YOU'D WANT TO OR NOT YOU ACTUALLY BENEFIT WHEN THERE'S OUTRAGE
IT'S WORKING ITS WAY SLOWLY ACROSS THE US AND WIPING OUT POPULATIONS OF BATS
WHAT ABOUT HEALTH
IT SIEVES OUT THE BAD VARIATION
SO INDEED WE NEED THEM FOR OUR ECOSYSTEMS TO FUNCTION PROPERLY
AND THE REALITY THAT BATS CAN BRING US SO MUCH BENEFITS IF WE JUST
AND HOPEFULLY IN THE NEXT 5 YEARS I'LL BE GIVING YOU A TED TALK ON THAT
AND 170 INCREASE OF INDIVIDUALS OVER 80
BUT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IT A BIT BETTER
BUT BATS ARE VERY DIFFERENT
YOU WILL GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE EVOLUTIONARY PRIOR OF THAT SITE IS
SO SAY FOR EXAMPLE THE REGION OF THE GENOME THAT I WAS LOOKING AT WAS A REGION THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR VISION
WITHOUT THEM IT'S GOING TO BE A PROBLEM
AND SO AS WITH FLIGHT IT'S VERY METABOLICALLY COSTLY
WE'RE A LITTLE FRIGHTENED BY THINGS THAT CAN PERCEIVE THE WORLD SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THAN US
AS I'VE SAID BEFORE BATS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR OUR ECOSYSTEMS TO FUNCTION CORRECTLY
SO WE JUST EXTEND THIS IDEA AND WE ARE LOOKING AT THE IDEA OF USING HIV ANTIBODIES IN LATE
AGAIN THERE IS A PROBLEM
HOW WOULD WE DO SOMETHING SIMILAR IN PLANTS
SO THE STANDARD OF CARE IN THESE PLACES IS TO WAIT FOR SOMEBODY TO GET BITTEN BY A POTENTIALLY RABID ANIMAL
OF COURSE WE DO HAVE ANTIRETROVIRAL DRUGS WHICH ARE CURRENTLY USED FOR THIS PURPOSE AND ARE ACTUALLY VERY EFFECTIVE
THERE WAS NO VACCINE NO TREATMENTS AVAILABLE FOR EBOLA
AND SO FOR THAT REASON THE US GOVERNMENT HAS PUT A LOT OF MONEY INTO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS PRODUCT
HOW DO WE START TO MAKE MEDICINES AVAILABLE FOR THE POOR IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WHO
SO ANTIBODIES ARE THE PROTEINS THAT OUR WHITE BLOOD CELLS NORMALLY MAKE IN RESPONSE TO INFECTIONS AND OTHER
NOW THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY HAS ALREADY BEEN QUITE SUCCESSFUL IN MAKING SYNTHETIC ANTIBODIES
SO HOW WOULD WE DO THAT IN PLANTS
AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY HAVE DONE FOR ME
HE FEELS LIGHT TOUCH DOWN TO ONE GRAM OF FORCE
AND YOU'VE GOT ONE OF THESE CONVENTIONAL ARMS
CAN WE GET MORE OUT OF IT
I COULD WORK THEM JUST BY MY THOUGHTS
WE TALK WITH OUR HANDS
YOU OPEN IT THESE MUSCLES CONTRACT
HE ALSO REQUIRED A REVISION SURGERY ON HIS CHEST
OK THIS IS THE MOMENT WHERE OUR GIRLS AND YOUNG WOMEN AND ADULT WOMEN BEGIN TO BE TREATED AS VICTIMS NOT AS
I CAME ORIGINALLY TO WORK WITH ADULT WOMEN COMING OUT OF THE SEX INDUSTRY
AND SO IN 1998 I DECIDED TO START GEMS WHICH IS GIRLS EDUCATIONAL AND MENTORING SERVICES KIND OF
AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'VE CONTINUOUSLY FOUND
WE DON'T LIVE IN THAT KIND OF COUNTRY
I WAS ORIGINALLY WORKING WITH ADULT WOMEN
WHERE'S YOUR ACCENT MISS
AND SO OUR STORIES OF GROWING UP IN POVERTY OUR STORIES OF GROWING UP IN TRAUMATIC
AND THEN GETTING STUCK
TEA APPLES RICE AND GINGER
SO WITH THIS GREAT BURDEN OF RESPONSIBILITY IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE INGENIOUS GROWERS OF
IT HAS MORE SPECIES OF PLANTS THAN THE WHOLE OF EUROPE PUT TOGETHER
INDEED WE'VE WORKED OUT WAYS TO MAKE THE STUBBORN THE RELUCTANT THE HARD TO GROW STRAIGHT FORWARD
WELL TO BE VULGAR ABOUT IT BEAUTY SELLS DOESN'T IT
IF I'VE REALLY GOT YOU HOOKED PERHAPS YOU START SUPPORTING THE CAUSE THAT I WORK FOR
A SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE LANDSCAPE AND AN ASIAN LANDSCAPE
WHAT IF THEY COULD REDUCE TESTING ANXIETY
WE'RE LETTING OUR FEAR AND OUR SKEPTICISM ABOUT THESE DEVICES HOLD US BACK FROM REALIZING THEIR
WHAT IF WE START TALKING TO KIDS REGULARLY ABOUT THE CONTENT ON THESE SCREENS
WHERE DID THEY MAKE A FEW MISTAKES BEFORE THEY FOUND THE RIGHT ANSWER
NOW I WAS PERHAPS AN UNLIKELY CHAMPION FOR THIS CAUSE
I STUDIED CHILDREN'S LITERATURE BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO WORK WITH KIDS AND BOOKS
AND I WALKED IN AND WAS ASSIGNED A THREE YEAR OLD NAMED MARIA
WHEN WILL I GET STOPPED
IF THERE'S A TAKEAWAY TO THIS TALK I HOPE IT'S THAT WE ALL FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE ACKNOWLEDGING THE
YOU CAN BE ANYTHING
BUT MOSTLY IT WAS DIFFICULT TO UNPACK A LEGACY OF GENDER AND RACIAL OPPRESSION WHEN I AM
THAT'S NOT ME
I AM ON THIS STAGE BECAUSE I AM A PRETTY WHITE WOMAN AND IN MY INDUSTRY WE CALL THAT A SEXY GIRL
BUT UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE TO INFORM YOU THAT IN 2007 A VERY INSPIRED NYU PH
STUDENT COUNTED ALL THE MODELS ON THE RUNWAY EVERY SINGLE ONE THAT WAS HIRED AND OF THE
WHEN ANIMALS ARE GOING TO MAKE A POINT THEY MAKE THE POINT
AND THE ANSWER IS RATHER STRANGE
IT'S A LETTER
NOW I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A FOUR PARAGRAPH FORMAT TO WORK WITH
BUT NOT ALL NARCISSISTS ARE CREATED EQUAL
PART OF WHAT THAT ALSO MEANS IS THAT PEOPLE CONTINUE TO BENEFIT FROM THERAPY EVEN AFTER THEY STOP GOING
WHAT A TRAINED THERAPIST DOES AMONG OTHER THINGS IS HELP US TO EXPLORE THE ROLE THAT WE ARE PLAYING IN OUR OWN
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THAT LADY WAS GOING TO DO TO ME
BECAUSE THESE NUMBERS
SO CLEARLY I GOT A LOT OUT OF IT
IF WE HAVE A HARD TIME FINDING A PARTNER OR IF WE FEEL INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATED WITH THE ONE WE'VE GOT
THE TRICKY PART IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE APPLY THIS THEORY OF LEARNING TO OUR EMOTIONAL LIVES OR TO HUMAN
THE BEAUTY OF THIS KIND OF THERAPY IS THAT IT CARRIES WITH IT A DEEP RESPECT FOR THE
I PERSONALLY DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY ROOM FOR JUDGMENT IN THERAPY AND I KNOW THAT'S A SENTIMENT I SHARE WITH MANY OF MY
IF EVERY TIME YOU GOT BEHIND THE WHEEL OF A CAR YOU HAD TO LEARN TO DRIVE ALL OVER AGAIN IT WOULD BE HARD TO GET
97 FOR OVERALL IMPROVEMENT AND 1
IT'S SOMETHING CALLED INSIGHT ORIENTED THERAPY AND I THINK THAT IN MANY WAYS IT'S GOTTEN A BAD RAP IN
97 FOR OVERALL PSYCHIATRIC IMPROVEMENT AND 1
AN EFFECT SIZE OF
I DIDN'T CONSIDER MYSELF A CRIMINAL
HEY WE'LL PAY FOR IT WE'LL BRING YOU TO THE CLASS YOU KNOW
THIS IS ABOUT YOUR FAMILY
AND SO I DID SO
AND AT THAT MOMENT I REALIZED THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT ME
IT WAS THEN THAT I SAID TO MYSELF THIS IS NOT ABOUT YOU ANYMORE
SO I TOOK THEM UP ON THEIR OFFER
DON'T SAY IT'S NOT FOR YOU UNLESS YOU GIVE IT A SHOT
THERE ARE SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL COMPONENTS OF THE MODEL AND ALSO CHANCES TO DEVELOP LEADERSHIP SKILLS WHICH
RECEIVING THAT GRADE MOTIVATED ME TO WANT TO GO ON IMMEDIATELY IN FULL TIME IN THE NEXT SEMESTER
IF IT DOESN'T WORK WHAT'S THE LOSS TO YOU
I COULDN'T PUT MY SISTER AND MY MOTHER THROUGH THAT AGAIN
SO AT THAT POINT I SAID YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE A CHANGE
THEY SERVED AS MY COUNSELORS THEY CAME TO MY HOUSE UNANNOUNCED TO MAKE SURE I WAS OK
THAT APATHETIC ATTITUDE POURED OVER INTO HIGH SCHOOL AND I EVENTUALLY GOT KICKED OUT OF THREE DIFFERENT HIGH
I BECAME WHAT I SAW EVERY DAY
I DON'T DESERVE THIS
I DIDN'T WORK FOR IT
WOULD THE WORLD BE A BETTER PLACE
AND WITH PROTEINS IT LOOKS A LOT BETTER
ONE OF THE GREATEST JOYS OF MY JOB IS TO BE ABLE TO TELL A PATIENT LIKE THIS THAT THEY NO LONGER HAVE
THERE'S TWO BIG REASONS
RULE NUMBER TWO IS
IF IT SAYS LIGHT LOW FAT OR FAT FREE STAYS IN GROCERY STORE
WHY IS THIS NOT EVERYWHERE
IT PROBABLY WON'T SURPRISE YOU TO HEAR THAT MOST OF MY PATIENTS HAVE INSULIN RESISTANCE OR
SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM THEN
I WANT YOU TO GO BACK AND THINK ABOUT THE LAST TIME YOU ATE AN AMERICAN VERSION OF CHINESE
HOW DOES SOMEBODY EAT THIS WAY
HER DIABETES WAS WAY OUT OF CONTROL
WE ARE IN A DIABETES EPIDEMIC NOW THAT WE ARE SPENDING 250 BILLION A YEAR ON IN THIS
RULE NUMBER ONE
BECAUSE THEY TOOK THE FAT OUT THEY PUT CARBS AND CHEMICALS IN
I AM A GREAT EXAMPLE
TWO IMPORTANT THINGS
DON'T BE FOOLED THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY TO BE MADE FROM KEEPING YOU SICK
SO WHAT DOES THIS LOOK LIKE THEN
AND WE HAVE THIS SETUP
THESE GUIDELINES THEN GO ON TO SAY
CAN YOU STILL EAT THIS WAY
WHY ISN'T LOW CARB THE NORM
PLUS IT'S BEEN SHOWN THAT 16 25 OF NORMAL WEIGHT ADULTS ARE
AND IT'S TIME WE CHANGE THAT
I'M A DOCTOR
SO IT STARTS TO RISE
IT IS HARD TO BREAK
AND EAT WHEN YOU'RE HUNGRY DON'T EAT WHEN YOU'RE NOT NO MATTER WHAT THE CLOCK SAYS
AND WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL IN A WAY
THE SECOND REASON IS BECAUSE YOU ARE DOING IT ANYWAY
AND THE GREAT THING ABOUT EMOJIS IS WE CAN FEEL A BROADER RANGE OF THINGS
IF WE CAN TELL AND SHARE SOCIALLY HOW WE FEEL IN THE FUTURE WE WILL KNOW MORE ABOUT
AND IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY MATTER HOW YOU START ON SOCIAL OR WHY YOU STARTED
UNRULY ARE A VIRAL VIDEO AGENCY AND THEY'VE STUDIED THIS TOO AND ACTUALLY THE
WHAT IF YOU ARE THINKING
SO I JUST PULLED MY COAT AROUND MY WAIST AND BABBLED MY WAY THROUGH THE OTHER CLASSES IN THE REST
SO ON THAT AFTERNOON I WAS THINKING YOU KNOW WHATEVER
I KNOW I AM GOING TO HAVE TO EXAGGERATE WILDLY AMPLIFY EVERYTHING THROUGH EMOJI JUST TO GET MY POINT
AND ANYONE CAN INSTIGATE THIS A PERSON A CHARITY A BRAND THAT WANTS TO DRIVE US TOWARDS GREATER
I KNOW YOU'VE ALL TAKEN THAT WHICH DISNEY PRINCESS AM I
MY TIGHT TROUSERS STORY
BECAUSE MAYBE WHERE WE START TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A PROBLEM IS WHERE THERE IS TOO MUCH NOISE
SO IN MY DAY JOB I RUN THE FUTURE FOUNDATION
MAYBE THEY NEVER WILL
SO I STUMBLED IN AND I THOUGHT WHAT THE HELL I'LL GIVE THIS A GO
BECAUSE I'D BEEN FLASHING MY PANTS AT THE CLASS FOR THE LAST HALF AN HOUR
WHAT CAN I DO
SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE HEROES IN YOUR MYTHS DON'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE YOU
JANE FOSTER SOMEONE WE ALREADY KNEW
SO HOW DO WE MAKE IT CONTINUE
IMAGINE IF YOU DID THIS IN EVERY AREA IN YOUR LIFE
A LOT OF PEOPLE ASK ME DANIEL HOW DO YOU FIND THESE PEOPLE
FINANCIALLY FOR PROMOTIONS FOR YOUR FAMILY AND YOU WROTE YOUR GOALS ON EVERY DAY
WELL I AM GLAD YOU ASKED
BOOKS ARE THE TOOLS THAT RELEASE THE HEAVENS OF YOUR MIND
AND LEADERS ARE READERS
SO GET AROUND PEOPLE WHO CAN
I SAID WELL JUST LIKE YOU REALLY
LITTLE CHILDREN WILL LAUGH LITTLE BABIES WILL LAUGH AT ANYTHING
HUMOR IS REALLY REALLY ACCESSIBLE NOW JUST LIKE YOU CAN DOWNLOAD MUSIC
I SAID WHY DON'T YOU COME ALONG
WE'VE RUN A COMPETITION THAT HAD 70 ENTRANCES IN THE FIRST YEAR
SO IT'S ALL ABOUT SEX GUYS
IT'S ALL ABOUT IMPROVISATION IT'S ALL ABOUT THINKING ON YOUR FEET IT'S ALL ABOUT TELLING A STORY IN AN AMUSING
AND I SAID WHAT ARE YOU UP TO
MY INHIBITIONS HAVE DROPPED AND THAT'S WHY WE CHANGE
THEY'RE OFTEN USED IN DRAMA
CRYING IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN YOU CRY YOU ARE EXCRETING NEGATIVE HORMONES THAT ARE
WE GO FROM STRENGTH TO STRENGTH
WE'VE JUST CLOSED THE ENTRY FOR THIS YEAR
THERE'S BOUND TO BE SOMEBODY WHO THINKS THEY'RE FUNNY IN THE WORKPLACE
THAT IS BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT NO FILTERS
YOU'D PROBABLY ENJOY A GOOD LAUGH
I DON'T LIKE LAUGHING SHE SAID
THEY WOULD DO DIFFERENT TYPE OF MATERIAL
SO THAT'S MY PRESCRIPTION FOR THE FUTURE
I KNOW I'M A MOTHER OF TWO CHILDREN AND I KNOW THAT WE DO THINGS LIKE WE TICKLE OUR CHILDREN TO
HOW DOES LAUGHING MAKE YOU FEEL
DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING
EVEN JUST SMILING RATHER THAN LAUGHING SENDS A SIGNAL TO YOUR BRAIN AND INCREASES THOSE HAPPY
WE'VE HAD OVER 400 WOMEN ENTERED
WHEN I DRAW WITH MY LEFT HAND IT IS A KIND OF CONVERSATION WITH MYSELF EXPLORING THE
ENJOY HAVE A NICE DAY
INITIALLY GOVERNMENTAL RED TAPE KEPT WILDLIFE RESCUERS FROM GOING TO TRISTAN BUT EVENTUALLY A SMALL TEAM
IN FACT MANY PENGUINS ARE STARVING AND THE PRIMARY CULPRITS ARE CLIMATE CHANGE AND
SADLY SEVERAL RECENT OIL SPILLS HAVE HARMED PENGUINS
I'M QUITE LAZY SO I SPEND 3 ON RETURN BUS TO THE STATION EVERY MORNING
THAT MAY NOT SOUND LIKE MUCH BUT IF YOU BUY A STARBUCKS EVERY SINGLE WEEKDAY THAT COSTS 4 POUNDS THAT'S
THE WORST THEY CAN DO IS SAY NO
BUT WHAT'S STRIKING IS THE COMMONALITIES THE STRUCTURAL FEATURES OF THESE NEW MODELS AND HOW THEY
SO LET'S SAY YOU'VE USED A PEER TO PEER LENDING PLATFORM LIKE LENDING TREE OR PROSPER THEN YOU'VE FIGURED OUT THAT
AND REMEMBER THAT IN THE 20TH CENTURY THIS WAS NOT AT ALL TRUE
OR WILL THAT NEW POWER BASE BITE BACK
SO WHAT'S THE MORAL OF THIS STORY
MORE PARTICIPATION MORE PEER COORDINATION SOMETIMES DISTORTS OUTCOMES AND THERE ARE SOME THINGS LIKE THINGS FOR EXAMPLE
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT AN EXERCISE OF TOP DOWN PERFECTIONISM THEY ARE ABOUT THE NETWORK
ONCE YOU HAVE AN EXPERIENCE OF NEW POWER YOU TEND TO EXPECT AND WANT MORE OF IT
SO WE'VE SPENT A BIT OF TIME THINKING HOW CAN WE PLOT ORGANIZATIONS ON A TWO BY
SO WILL NEW POWER ELITES JUST BECOME OLD POWER AND SQUEEZE
AND TO ME THAT'S ABSOLUTELY WORTH TRYING FOR
AND IN FACT THAT MODEL MEANS THAT THE CHALLENGE FOR NEW POWER IS HOW DO YOU USE
TODAY FOR BETTER OR WORSE
NEW POWER VALUES PARTICIPATION AND NEW POWER IS ALL ABOUT DO IT YOURSELF
AND I THINK WE ALL SENSE THAT SOMETHING BIG IS HAPPENING
I SEE PEOPLE NODDING
AND THIS REFLECTS THE EXTRAORDINARY STRENGTH OF THE EMERGING INDIAN MIDDLE CLASS AND THE
I'LL GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE OF A FAX CAMPAIGN THAT I RAN
BUT I'VE ALWAYS HAD A FEAR OF SHARKS AND WHAT LAID DEEP BENEATH ME IN THE WATER
THE MEDIA PORTRAYS THESE CREATURES AS MONSTERS KILLING MACHINES
ACCORDING TO THE NOAA THE NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERE ADMINISTRATION THE OCEAN
OUR PLAN WAS TO SNORKEL OVER IT
I'M SURE EVERYONE HERE HAS DONE SOME GREAT AND PRETTY COOL THINGS
I'M NOT A PERSON WHO HATES THE OCEAN
AND THERE WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COBALT BLUE EXPANSE
WELL I TOO FELT THIS PIT OF EXITEMENT INSIDE ME
AND AS MUCH IS THE EXPLORER IN ALL OF US YEARNS TO BE FREE AND AS MUCH WE TRY TO EXPLORE ALL THAT WE CAN
I FIND IT SUCH A PROFOUND ONE
IT'S THE WHY' PART OF IT
AND IN FACT AS MAN BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND MORE HIS COMPLEX AND AMBIVALENT NATURE HARMONY GREW
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE MUSIC STOPS
THE QUESTION REMAINS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE MUSIC STOPS
WELL THAT'S WHY I TAKE EVERY PERFORMANCE SO SERIOUSLY WHY IT MATTERS TO ME SO MUCH
IT SPEARHEADED A CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN WHICH ARTISTS LIKE CARUSO AND BESSIE SMITH WERE ON THE SAME
NOW THIS MOMENT SO FASCINATES ME
SO MANY EMOTIONS SEEM TO BE INSIDE OF IT
AND FOR HIM IT WASN'T SO MUCH THE WAY THE MUSIC GOES AS ABOUT WHAT IT
MOZART WAS THE SAME WAY
THERE WAS A VAST AMOUNT OF INFORMATION BEING SHARED ONLINE
WE COULD TRACK THIS CONVOY BACK TO THE BASE IT CAME FROM THE 53RD AIR DEFENSE BRIGADE
WE PUT IN THE NAME OF THE SHOP
SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE KNOWN THEM
SOME OF IT WAS HIDDEN SOME OF IT WAS QUITE EASY TO FIND
IN FACT ON JULY 21ST 2014 THEY GAVE A PRESS CONFERENCE WHERE THEY PRESENTED THEIR OWN EVIDENCE OF WHAT
THIS WAS TAKEN AROUND MIDDAY ON JULY 17TH 2014
WHEN THE JOINT INVESTIGATION TEAM INTERVIEWED ME AS A WITNESS TO ASK ABOUT THE WORK WE WERE DOING I
THE FIRST RESULT WAS ACTUALLY A WIKI SOMEONE HAD CREATED WITH EVERY STREET OF EVERY TOWN IN EASTERN UKRAINE WITH
WE SEARCHED FOR THAT ADDRESS AND CAME UP WITH SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING
SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE KNOWN PEOPLE AFFECTED BY THE TRAGEDY
SEVERAL HOURS LATER OVER EASTERN UKRAINE IT WAS SHOT DOWN
193 DUTCH CITIZENS DIED ON THAT PLANE
AND SO MANY PEOPLE WITH AUTISM ARE BEING OVERLOOKED EVERY DAY AND THEY'RE BEING TAKEN
SHE SAID DO THAT THING YOU KNOW WITH YOUR EYES WHEN YOU'RE FLIRTING WITH GUYS
MY GOAL IS TO SHIFT PEOPLE'S PERSPECTIVE OF AUTISM AND PEOPLE WITH
FOR EXAMPLE ONCE I HAD AN AFFAIR WITH CALCULUS THAT LASTED LONGER THAN SOME CELEBRITY MARRIAGES
YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT I DON'T HAVE MUCH INFLECTION IN MY VOICE
THAT'S WHY PEOPLE OFTEN CONFUSE ME WITH A GPS
AND IT REMINDED ME OF MY DAYS WHEN I SAT IN THIS EXACT SAME PRISON
I GO TO WORK EVERY DAY AS AN ENGINEER AND I'M PAID TO DREAM
AND THEN THEY WENT TO SEE IF THESE TRIALS HAD BEEN PUBLISHED IN THE PEER REVIEWED ACADEMIC LITERATURE
WE WON'T PUBLISH ANY JOURNALS WE WON'T PUBLISH ANY TRIALS UNLESS THEY'VE BEEN REGISTERED BEFORE THEY BEGAN
THAT WOULD MEAN THAT I WAS A CHANCER
THESE DRUGS WERE BROUGHT TO MARKET
AND THIS IS WHAT THEY FOUND
IF I FLIPPED A COIN 100 TIMES BUT THEN WITHHELD THE RESULTS FROM YOU FROM HALF OF THOSE
AND SO THEN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE OF MEDICAL JOURNAL EDITORS CAME ALONG AND THEY SAID OH WELL WE WILL HOLD THE LINE
BUT PEOPLE DIDN'T BOTHER TO USE THOSE REGISTERS
BUT THAT WOULDN'T MEAN THAT I HAD A TWO HEADED COIN
WE CANNOT KNOW THE TRUE EFFECTS OF THE MEDICINES THAT WE PRESCRIBE IF WE DO NOT
AND WHEN THAT RESPONSIBILITY IS DIFFUSED BETWEEN A WHOLE NETWORK OF RESEARCHERS ACADEMICS
THE RESULTS WERE UNAVAILABLE TO THEM
BUT IT TURNED OUT THAT I WAS MISLED
WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN YOUR NEGATIVE DATA
FORTY SEVEN OUT OF THOSE 53 WERE UNREPLICABLE
FIFTY PATIENTS GOT LORCAINIDE AND OF THOSE PATIENTS 10 DIED
THEN I THOUGHT WHY NOT
I'M GOING TO TRY
WELL I'M GOING TO STAY IN THE UNIVERSITY
COME JOIN ME
I'M GOING TO BE AN HONEST LAWYER
HOW SIMPLE IS THAT
SO LET'S START OVER
I DON'T BELIEVE I HAVE TO LOOK ANOTHER HUMAN BEING IN THE FACE AND TELL THEM WHAT I DID WRONG LAST WEEK
GANDHI KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT WHEN HE SAID THAT
AND THEN THE NEXT WEEK WHEN THEY RUN UP TO ME AGAIN AND GO LIKE
AND OUT OF MY MOTHER'S CURIOSITY SHE WENT THROUGHOUT MY BIRTH RECORDS AND TO HER DISMAY SHE FOUND OUT THAT I WAS A
I'M OK WITH SAYING NO TO THINGS I'M OK WITH SAYING YES TO THINGS AND I'M OK WITH BEING ABLE TO
AND IT'S ALSO THE SAME GOD THAT LOOKS AFTER ME IN EVERY ASPECT OF MY LIFE
MY FATHER PASSED OUT AND HE WAS DRAGGED OUT IN A WHEELCHAIR AND HE WAS CRYING OUT IN THE LOBBY
THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO GET AWAY FROM
IT'S NOT THAT WE DON'T WANT TO FEEL SOMETHING EMOTIONALLY
WE WANT THE WHOLE RANGE OF FEELINGS
AND EVERYONE DOES
IT'S OUR FREE WILL IT'S HOW I LOOK
I AM BEAUTIFUL
I USED TO SAY TO MYSELF YOU AIN'T SHIT
MY NAME IS CARMEN JONES
I AM A LEADER WITH AN IMPECCABLE DRIVE
I AM A DIAMOND FACETED WITH MANY CUTS
STAND UP FOR YOURSELF
IT IS TIME FOR US TO REMOVE THE BARRIERS THAT PERMANENTLY RELEGATE INDIVIDUALS WITH CRIMINAL
I NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN ANY TYPE OF ILLEGAL ACTIVITY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR AN UNTREATED
AT FIRST HE WAS VERY INTERESTED
I DON T BLAME THEM
NOR DO I BLAME THE DEAN FOR HIS INITIAL SKEPTICISM
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE OLD METALLIC CASES WITH THE GLASS FRONT THE BLACK PERFORATED BACKGROUND THAT YOU WOULD
SHOULD I SHOULDN'T I
IS IT HELPING ME LEARN
SO TODAY THERE ARE COMPANIES WORKING TO CREATE AN IDENTITY IN A BLACK
YOU WANT TO LISTEN TO THE SONG
IT'S NOT A FIAT CURRENCY CONTROLLED BY A NATION STATE
AND THEN THIS AVATAR IS SWEEPING UP ALL OF THIS DATA AND ENABLING YOU TO
MUSICIANS ARE LEFT WITH CRUMBS AT THE END OF THE WHOLE FOOD CHAIN
THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T GET FAIR COMPENSATION AND WITH BLOCKCHAINS THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE
YOU WANT TO PUT THE SONG IN YOUR MOVIE THAT'S DIFFERENT AND THE IP RIGHTS ARE ALL SPECIFIED
YOU WANT TO MAKE A RINGTONE
AND THAT'S OF GREATER INTEREST
AND IT'S NOT SOCIAL MEDIA
OUR PRIVACY IS BEING UNDERMINED
WHAT IF THERE WERE A NATIVE MEDIUM FOR VALUE
BUT WHO KNOWS THAT
IN A COUNTRY LIKE OURS WHERE WE BREATHE WI FI LEVERAGING TECHNOLOGY FOR A FASTER RECOVERY SHOULD BE A NO
YOU SENT ME TO THAT PLACE ON WASHINGTON STREET YESTERDAY AND NOW I'M COVERED IN POISON IVY
AND YOU'VE ONLY GOT ABOUT SEVEN DAYS TO CAPTURE 50 PERCENT OF ALL OF THE WEB SEARCHES THAT WILL EVER BE MADE TO HELP YOUR
AS WE WATCHED THEY BECAME FRUSTRATED AND LEFT TO GO FIND SOMEBODY TO HELP ON THEIR OWN
SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON
THE POINT IS IF THERE'S A FLOOD OR A FIRE OR A HURRICANE YOU OR SOMEBODY LIKE YOU ARE GOING TO STEP
I'M GOOD AT FACEBOOK
WE'RE WORKING ON GETTING THE SOFTWARE TO PLACES SO PEOPLE EXPECT IT SO PEOPLE KNOW HOW TO USE IT AND SO IT CAN BE FILLED AHEAD OF TIME WITH THAT
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE SAME TRANSFORMATION IN TEXAS AND IN ALABAMA
AND WHY NOT ME
I'M A CAMPAIGN ORGANIZER
THEN SOME SPORTING EVENT HAPPENS AND YOU'VE GOT ONLY THE RESOURCES THAT YOU'VE COLLECTED THUS FAR TO MEET THE NEXT FIVE YEARS OF
SO THEY USE POST ITS OR EXCEL OR FACEBOOK
AFTER A LAMPPOST FLEW BY MY FAMILY AND I SPRINTED INTO THE BASEMENT
IN A DISASTER HOWEVER YOU START WITH ALL OF THE INTEREST AND NONE OF THE CAPACITY
IT'S CALLED WALKER AIR FORCE BASE
THEY SEND OUT A TEAM
IT WAS THEIR ORIGINAL PROJECT
I NEVER REALLY WANTED TO BE A NON FICTION WRITER
I HATED NON FICTION GROWING UP
AND WOMEN ARE MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE AND THEREFORE MUCH MORE PERSUASIVE WHEN THEY'RE NEGOTIATING IN A POSITIVE SUM
I MEAN THIS WAS THEIR HOMES BEHIND US THAT HAVE IN GROUND SWIMMING POOLS
WE WERE GOING TO DO ALL THE THINGS THAT WE NEEDED TO DO AND WE WERE BRINGING IN A GREAT BUSINESS AND A GREAT EMPLOYER AND A GREAT
AND WE NEED TO SURVEY YOUR HEIRLOOM TOMATOES IF WE'RE GOING TO TAKE DOWN THIS FENCE
BUT WITH REGARD TO NEGOTIATING PROFITABLE DEALS I THINK THAT THERE IS A SUBSTANTIVE DIFFERENCE
AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT 10 YEARS AGO I PROPOSED TEARING DOWN A 50 YEAR OLD COMPLETELY
AND I TRULY BELIEVE IT'S A PROBLEM THAT SOLVES ITSELF
BUT IT WAS AN AMAZING LESSON ABOUT HOW TO PERSUADE HOW TO BE PERSUASIVE IN A
WE WEREN'T KIND OF OUT IN THE STICKS
I MEAN THIS IS A FANCY PART OF TOLEDO
THAT IS MOST CERTAINLY THE MESSAGE
WE DON'T WIN
YOU CAN' FIGHT CITY HALL AND WIN
THAT'S THE ZERO SUM
I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON THE BUSINESS RESULTS BECAUSE THAT'S AN AREA THAT I'M MORE FAMILIAR WITH
HIGH EXECUTIVE'S FUNCTIONING SKILLS
WHERE WOMEN WERE FOUND LACKING IN WHAT I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT TODAY WERE IN TWO AREAS
I COULDN'T AGREE MORE
BECAUSE THE DEATH OF A CHILD IS COMPENSATED BY ONE MORE CHILD
THIS IS A QUIZ
AND THEREFORE I WILL LIMIT MYSELF TO ONLY TALK ABOUT THE LINKS BETWEEN RELIGION AND SEXUALITY
WE GET THAT FROM THE CENSUS DATA
COMPLIANCE AUDITS CONSULTANTS' DIAGNOSTICS
WE WILL KNOW WHO TO BLAME
WE NEED SOMEBODY ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS PROCESS
FROM 83 TO 95 TWO PERCENT PER ANNUM
WE ARE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO PUT ACCOUNTABILITY IN SOMEONE'S HANDS
YOU KNOW THIS DRIVE FOR CLARITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY TRIGGERS A
BUT BUSINESS HAS BECOME MUCH MORE COMPLEX
DID YOU THROW IT OR DID YOU PASS IT
BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS TEAMS IN THESE ORGANIZATIONS SPEND BETWEEN 40 AND 80
IT WILL COME AT THE EXPENSE OF YOUR MEASURABLE SPEED
THIS IS MATH
THEY MAKE HUMAN EFFORTS DERAIL
THEY ARE THE FAVORITE TEAM TO WIN
AND THIS YEAR THE US TEAM IS IN GREAT SHAPE
IT'S ALL ANONYMOUS BUT ANYWAY I STUDY THE NUMBERS
I CALL THEM THAT BECAUSE I WAS WORKING WITH A DATING SITE I NEEDED TO NAME THESE PEOPLE
CREATIVITY SEEMS TO BE LINKED WITH THE DOPAMINE SYSTEM IN THE BRAIN
THERE ARE TWO BASIC ASPECTS OF PERSONALITY OF COURSE WITH EPIGENETICS NOW WE KNOW THAT
SO I'M GOING TO GO VERY RAPIDLY THROUGH THESE FOUR BROAD STYLES OF THINKING AND BEHAVING THROUGH THE
I DID A STUDY OF HALF A MILLION PEOPLE
I WENT WE TALKED TO JOURNALISTS FOR A WEEK AND THEN CAME THE FINAL NIGHT
AS A MATTER OF FACT I HAVE A FRIEND WHO GOES ANNUALLY TO HIS ACCOUNTANT WITH HIS WIFE AND ABOUT 10 YEARS
MUST HAVE THEM
COM THE SITE THAT I STARTED WITH MATCH
I THINK MORE POWERFUL THAN THE SEX DRIVE
IT'S A DRIVE IT'S A BASIC MATING DRIVE
SO I BEGAN TO DECIDE THAT I WOULD STUDY PERSONALITY
BUT MOSTLY IT WAS DIFFICULT TO UNPACK A LEGACY OF GENDER AND RACIAL OPRESSION WHEN I'M
AND YEAH THEY PRETTY MUCH RETOUCH ALL THE PHOTOS BUT THAT IS ONLY A SMALL COMPONENT OF WHAT'S HAPPENING
IF THERE IS A TAKE AWAY TO THIS TALK I HOPE IS THAT WE ALL FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE ACKNOWLEDGING THE

I AM ON THIS STAGE BECAUSE I AM A PRETTY WHITE WOMEN
IN MY INDUSTRY WE CALL THAT A SEXY GIRL

AND SO BY COLLECTING THIS DATA YOU CAN FIND OUT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR THYROID
HERE TAKE THIS ONE INSTEAD
AFTER WATCHING THIS VIDEO AN HOUR LATER RICH PEOPLE BECAME JUST AS GENEROUS OF
AND THAT'S A REALLY REALLY INCREDIBLE INSIGHT INTO HOW THE MIND MAKES SENSE OF
THIS IS FOR THEM
EVEN PEOPLE AT THE TOP EXPERIENCE THESE OUTCOMES
THAT'S PRETTY COOL
AND THESE TWO GUYS ARE NAMED GUIER AND WEIFFENBACH
IT WILL BE USEFUL IN 2020
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS HAS HAPPENED
WE SHOULD RECORD IT
IT WAS RIGHT AT 20 MHZ SO YOU COULD PICK IT UP REALLY EASILY BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID THAT PEOPLE WOULD THINK IT WAS A HOAX BASICALLY
I MEAN HERE YOU HAVE THESE GUYS WHO BASICALLY THOUGHT THEY WERE JUST FOLLOWING THIS HUNCH THIS LITTLE PASSION THAT HAD DEVELOPED
AND THEY START TALKING AND ONE OF THEM SAYS HEY HAS ANYBODY TRIED TO LISTEN FOR THIS THING
AND SO GUIER AND WEIFFENBACH GO BACK TO WEIFFENBACH'S OFFICE AND THEY START KIND OF NOODLING AROUND HACKING AS WE MIGHT CALL IT NOW
SO WHEN THEY WERE SITTING IN FRONT OF THE MICROSCOPE WHEN THEY WERE TALKING TO THEIR COLLEAGUE AT THE WATER COOLER AND ALL THESE THINGS
AND THE QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU GET YOUR BRAIN INTO ENVIRONMENTS WHERE THESE NEW NETWORKS ARE GOING TO BE MORE LIKELY TO
SO THE TECHNOLOGY IS THERE
SO THEY STARTED TO THINK COULD WE BUILD A NEONATAL INCUBATOR THAT'S BUILT ENTIRELY OUT OF
I BOUGHT INTO THIS DREAM MORE THAN ANYONE
WE UNDERSTAND THAT GRIEF CAN BE OVERWHELMING SO WE HAVE A REGISTERED
THEN I DISPENSE THAT EXTRA PAIN RELIEF BECAUSE IN THAT PET'S LIFE
OVER RECENT YEARS WE HAVE SEEN DRAMATIC CHANGES IN THE STANDARDS OF CARE THAT VETS CAN
HOWEVER QUITE SOON AFTER GRADUATION I REALIZED THAT I ALSO REALLY CARED ABOUT
IF MY ACTIONS TODAY WILL MAKE THEIR TOMORROW A LITTLE BETTER THEN THAT IS ABSOLUTELY AN
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW WE IMPLEMENT THE IDEALS OF PALLIATIVE CARE FOR OUR PETS
AT ITS HEART PALLIATIVE MEDICINE IS ABOUT DELIVERING THE MOST COMPASSIONATE CARE WE CAN
IT IS ABOUT ENSURING THAT WE ARE ADEQUATELY MANAGING THEIR PAIN AND THE PROGRESSION OF THEIR
I'M A VETERINARIAN WHICH MEANS THAT THROUGHOUT MY LIFE MY SOLE FOCUS HAS ALWAYS
IN SOME CASES THE MOST INNOVATIVE AND URBAN HOTELS HAVE BEGUN TO DEFINE THEIR
TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE ACE HOTELS IN NEW YORK AND PORTLAND
A HOTEL HOLDS THE PROMISE EVERY DAY OF ADVENTURE AND ROMANCE INTRIGUE
IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THAT WE TOOK THIS HOTEL WHICH WAS BUILT IN THE HEIGHT OF ASPEN'S SILVER BOOM
I'LL LEAVE YOU WITH THIS FINAL THOUGHT
EXCEPT IN ONE CATEGORY
AND WHERE SHOULD THAT COME FROM
AND WHAT IS A CHILD
WHAT'S YOUR SUPER POWER
WHO'S ORGANIZING THE COMMUNITY
WELL ONE YEAR SHE HAD A YOUNG WOMAN SHE ASSIGNED HIM TO A CLIENT NAMED
I'M A SOCIAL WOKER WHAT'S YOUR SUPER POWER
THE TWO BIGGEST THINGS
OR FIGURE OUT HOW TO PAY THOSE HUGE HOSPITAL BILLS
THEN THERE'S THE BIGGER PICTURE
GALILEO MISSION TOLD US THAT BUT WE NEVER SAW ANY PLUMES
BECAUSE IT WASN'T RED MARS IT WAS GRAY MATERIAL IT'S GRAY MARS
THESE CRATERS ARE WEEPING DURING THE SUMMER
BUT WHAT DID WE FIND
ROSABETH MOSS KANTER THE HARVARD ACADEMIC PUTS IT BEAUTIFULLY WHEN SHE SAYS THAT WHEN
THAT WAS HIS GREAT PASSION TAKING BRANCHES FROM FALLEN TREES AND CARVING THEM INTO WALKING STICKS
MOST PEOPLE WHEN THEY SEE LITTER WHAT THEY DO IS ONE OF TWO THINGS TYPICALLY
THE ONLY WAY THAT WE CAN ADDRESS LONELINESS IS BY BUILDING COMMUNITY BY BUILDING DEEP
SO OFTEN WHEN WE LABEL PEOPLE AS VULNERABLE OR AS DEFICIENT OR AS PROBLEMATIC
I BELIEVE THAT THE SOLUTION TO THE MOST INTRACTABLE PROBLEMS THAT WE FACE
THEY ARE IN A SCHOOL THAT LOOKS AS MUCH LIKE AN ECONOMIC HUB AS IT DOES A SCHOOL IT S A SCHOOL THAT IS FOCUSED
THE TWO ISSUES THAT THEY TOOK ON THE FIRST WAS THE FACT THAT THERE WERE STREET CHILDREN IN EACH OF THEIR VILLAGES
ROBIN IS NOT A CLIENT IN A SERVICE
HE INVITED THEM TO BRING THEIR GIFTS
AND WHAT ROBIN SAID WHEN SHE ASKED THOSE QUESTIONS WAS HE WAS PASSIONATE ABOUT MAKING WALKING STICKS
OR INDEED TO HELP AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY
WE CAN BEGIN TO ACTUALLY REFLECT ON A FORM OF HELPING WHICH STARTS WITH A FOCUS ON WHAT'S STRONG
PEOPLE TELLING US THAT THESE ARE THE ASSETS THAT MUST BE IDENTIFIED CONNECTED AND
IS A QUESTION THAT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ASK MILLIONS OF OTHER PEOPLE EVERY SINGLE DAY
I WAS THE ONLY ONE TO THINK THAT
WE NEED TO MAKE TWO CHANGES TO THE WAY WE THINK AND INCORPORATE ENGINEERS
ALSO THERE WERE LOTS OF GREAT SPEAKERS
AND I WAS REALLY BUSY FIRST YEAR
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT WHEN A SURGEON MAKES A MISTAKE HE KILLS THE PATIENT THAT'S IN FRONT
WE NEED THE PROFESSIONALS TO CHANGE THAT
WE WERE ALL REALLY ENCOURAGED AND INSPIRED FOR THE ENTIRE FOUR DAYS OF THE DEBATE BECAUSE THESE WERE PEOPLE WHO SAW
AND IT WAS JUST HIM SPEAKING
THERE ISN'T MUCH SHARING THERE
I'M LIKE OH THAT'S FUNNY
MY FACIAL EXPRESSION DIDN'T CHANGE AT ALL
I WAS HAVING A WHALE OF A TIME
I WAS BEING TAUGHT IN FRENCH AND ENGLISH ALL THE TIME
I FOUND THAT THAT WAS HOME
WHEN I LEFT HIGH SCHOOL AND I CAME TO UNIVERSITY I BROUGHT THAT MODEL ALONG WITH ME
AND IT HAD A PICTURE OF A SAILBOAT ON IT ON THIS WATER
YOU DON'T DO THAT
WATCH FOR 3 THINGS
IN OTHER WORDS IT BECAME SOMETHING PEOPLE DID MORE AND MORE AUTOMATICALLY
I KNEW THAT BUT WHAT I DIDN'T KNOW WAS THIS UKULELE IT WAS AN OLD MARTIN WITH
AND ALONG THE WAY AS I WAS SHARING IT I'M A RESEARCHER SO OF COURSE I'M DOING RESEARCH ON HOW TO TEACH IT BETTER
YOU TRY ANOTHER SPOT
AND I STARTED BLAMING MYSELF THAT I WASN'T GOOD AT PADDLE BOARDING
BUT I THINK YOU NEED TO PRACTICE IN THE RIGHT WAY
THAT'S HOW YOU SHOULD PRACTICE THE SKILL OF BRINGING NEW BEHAVIORS INTO YOUR LIFE
THEY'RE MORE LIKE PHILOSOPHERS
WATCH FOR THE RIPPLE EFFECTS
HOW CAN I UNDERSTAND MY OWN BEHAVIOR BY PRACTICING THIS HABIT
AND THAT'S WHAT IT'S LIKE WITH ME AS I AM DOING MY RESEARCH HERE'S THIS GEM IT'S MY FAVORITE HABIT AND I'M GOING TO SHARE IT WITH YOU
WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES A BEHAVIOR BECOME AUTOMATIC
SO HE IS THERE WITH HIS 3 BOYS
A FEW YEARS AGO IT WAS MY BIRTHDAY MY PARTNER AND I WERE SITTING OUT ON OUR PATIO IN
VERY BLACK AND WHITE THINKING AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE IT CAME FROM
IS IT A MANHATTAN PROJECT
IN THE NUCLEAR SPACE THERE ARE OTHER INNOVATORS
WHAT SHOULD OUR REPORT CARD LOOK LIKE
IN FACT IF YOU COULD PICK JUST ONE THING TO LOWER THE PRICE OF TO REDUCE POVERTY BY FAR YOU WOULD
SO LET'S THINK HOW SHOULD WE MEASURE OURSELVES
YOU MAY NEED HEART SURGERY OR SOMETHING
THE FRENCH AND JAPANESE HAVE DONE SOME WORK
SO I'M OPTIMISTIC
IT SHOULDN'T TAKE AWAY FROM OTHER THINGS
SO IF YOU HAVE VERY
WHERE IS THERE MOST INTEREST IN ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING WITH THIS
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO THERE SEEMS LIKE IT MIGHT BE SIMPLE BUT IT'S NOT
NOW THE EXACT AMOUNT OF HOW YOU MAP FROM A CERTAIN INCREASE OF CO2 TO WHAT
IT'S AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT FIVE TONS FOR EVERYONE ON THE PLANET
IF YOU BURN NATURAL GAS NO
AND IS PRESIDENT OF THE MATH CLUB
HOW DO I KNOW YOU WERE THINKING ABOUT IT
WE PRACTICE THIS BY DOING ONE THING AT A TIME THROUGHOUT THE DAY
CHILDREN DON'T NEED TO BE DRUGGED
AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS ALL DAY
IT DRIFTS AWAY BRING IT BACK
BUT MOSTLY NO
AND I GOT TOLD TO CONCENTRATE ALL THE TIME
I'D BE A BETTER BALLET DANCER
WHETHER IT'S POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE IT DOESN'T MATTER
SOME OF YOU MAY REMEMBER THE KODAK MOMENT BUT THAT REALLY WAS JUST A MOMENT IN TIME BECAUSE
HOW DID YOU ADAPT
THAT IS REALLY WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT TO US
WHAT WILL HELP YOU GET THERE
THAT'S WHY I WENT THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL TO UNIVERSITY TO A DEGREE THAT I TODAY DON'T ACTUALLY USE TO A JOB THAT
I'D LOVE YOU TO GO AWAY AND THINK ABOUT THIS IN YOUR OWN TIME
I WAITED UNTIL I WAS IN MY LATE 20'S
I HAD NO IDEA
I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO FIND A JOB I SUPPOSE YOU'D SAY AND THEN FROM THAT JOB HAVE BASICALLY BEEN IN MY CAREER EVER
I CERTAINLY KNOW THAT WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I DID NOT HAVE ANYWHERE NEAR ENOUGH LIFE EXPERIENCE AND WISDOM TO BE ABLE TO SET
HOW WE IMPACT OTHERS HOW WE IMPACT THE WORLD AND THE LEGACY WE LEAVE BEHIND
WHO DO YOU ENJOY SPENDING TIME WITH
IF YOU KEEP ASKING WHY
HE WORKED OUT WHAT MATTERED TO HIM HE STRUCTURED HIS LIFE AROUND THAT
IN MY FAITH
THOSE PRIORITIES WILL KEEP CHANGING THAT'S OKAY
WHAT PEOPLE ARE YOU PASSIONATE ABOUT
THE REASON I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT REALLY MATTERS IN LIFE IS BECAUSE I THINK IT DETERMINES A LOT OF THE OTHER
BEING AWARE OF WHAT REALLY MATTERS WILL HELP DRIVE YOUR PATH
I WILL KEEP CHANGING MY ANSWERS
THAT'S WHY IT TOOK ME SO LONG
AND WHAT WE DO BETWEEN NOT TO BE MORBID NOT TO BE SOMBRE BUT WHAT WE DO BETWEEN THAT IS OUR LIVES
I WILL HAVE HOPEFULLY MET MY GOAL
THAT WAS COMPLETELY WRONG
AS IT HAPPENED BECAUSE OF THAT CONVENIENCE BECAUSE OF THAT ACCESS I ACTUALLY CHANGED MY BEHAVIOUR AND I STARTED DOING
I DID NOT HAVE THE ANSWERS FOR A LONG TIME MY DAD EVEN LONGER
IT WAS KNOCK YOU OFF YOUR FEET LYING ON THE COLD BATHROOM FLOOR ALTERNATING BETWEEN
WHAT IS IT THAT WE NEED
FATHER MOTHER THIS MAN SHALL BE MY WIFE
AND UNLESS THIS IS ACTUALLY INTERNALIZED IT WON'T HAPPEN
WE NEED TO BREAK DOWN OUR VISION OF WHAT PLANNERS ARE OF WHAT THE CORRECT
SO WHAT IS IT THAT WE REQUIRE
AND SHE CREATED A DANCE PIECE WHICH THEN PRIME MINISTER NEHRU SAW
HE CAME TO TALK TO HER AND SAID WHAT IS THIS ABOUT
SO WHY ARE WE NOT DOING SOMETHING TO ACTUALLY ATTEND THAT PROBLEM ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS
THAT MAKES THE BRAIN VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND
SO WE THINK WE CAN ONLY GO ABOUT A FACTOR OF SIXTEEN DENSER IN TRANSISTORS ON A CHIP
BECAUSE OUR CLASSICAL COMPUTERS HAVE TO GROW EXPONENTIALLY IN SIZE IN ORDER TO
AND THE OTHER ASPECT IS NEUROMORPHIC OR COGNITIVE COMPUTING
THEY FLED IRAN IN TERRIBLE CIRCUMSTANCES ONE NIGHT
STAND UP FOR JUSTICE AND NEVER EVER GIVE UP
THE GUARDS SAID NO
YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO SEE THEM BECAUSE LAWYER'S VISITING HOURS IN IMMIGRATION DETENTION ARE 9 TO 17
AND WITH MORE WIT THAN PREPARATION I SAID WELL DO YOU THINK IT APPROPRIATE TO KNOW ABOUT THESE MATTERS AND REMAIN SILENT
SAME WEBSITE TWO DOMAIN DOORS
AND ONLY ONE
LET'S START AT THE BEGINNING LET'S START WITH THE STORY OF CREATION
I LOVE THIS ONE THE BEST
LET'S GO BACK TO THIS PLAN
SOME THINGS MAKE SENSE OK YOU KNOW
THE KING PUT OUT A REWARD
AND SHE SAYS WELL I AM COMPLETELY FED UP BECAUSE IN ALL MY LIFE THERE'S
HE'S RICH HE'S SPOILED HE CAN HAVE ANYBODY HE WANTS HE CAN DO ANYTHING HE WANTS AND SHE WANTS HIM ALL TO HERSELF
AND THAT IS A STORY THAT'S BECOMING COMPLETELY OBSOLETE
AND SO SHIVA ONCE AGAIN CAME TO THE RESCUE
AND FOR THIS WORLD THAT HE WAS GOING TO CREATE HE WAS GOING TO POPULATE IT WITH BEINGS THAT WERE BOTH MAN AND
HE REALIZED WHAT KIND OF SIN HE HAD BROUGHT INTO THE WORLD
THIS IS HOW YOU CREATE A BEING THAT'S BOTH MAN AND WOMAN IN ONE BODY
END QUOTE THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT
WILL YOU BUY SOMEONE ELSE'S SAMPLE
WOW YOU CAN DO THAT ON ACCORDION
WELCOME TO AFROTOPIA
ALL ARE INVITED
SHE MULTIPLIES HERSELF
AND WHAT IS YOUR POWER
PLEASE TELL ME
MY FAVORITE ACCOUNT WAS FROM AN UNSCHOOLING MOM HER NAME IS JENNIFER
I COULD GO ON THIS STAGE FOR AN HOUR TELLING YOU STORIES LIKE THAT BUT DON'T WORRY I ONLY HAVE TEN
WHEN ERIC HAD FOUGHT HODGKIN'S AS A CHILD LEARNING THE SAXOPHONE GAVE HIM THE WILL TO GET UP AND GO
AND MY FRIEND SAID
WHAT WERE ALL THOSE RENAISSANCES ABOUT THOUGH
IF I DO DON'T TELL ME WHAT THE MISTAKE IS JUST SAY YOU'RE CLOSE OR SOMETHING AND I'LL
THIS TIME I WON'T EVEN WRITE THESE DOWN
TELL ME IN ADVANCE THE DAY OF THE WEEK
NOW LET ME EXPLAIN ONE MORE THING
ONE DIGIT AT A TIME I SHALL TRY AND DETERMINE THE DIGIT YOU'VE LEFT OUT
THE ODDS OF ME GETTING ALL THREE OF THESE RIGHT BY PURE GUESSING WOULD BE ONE IN 1000
I'M GOING TO TRY TO SQUARE SOME THREE DIGIT NUMBERS
WE PUT IN RAINWATER HARVESTING SYSTEMS
AND DO YOU KNOW THAT IT CAN EVEN DO THIS
FOR EXAMPLE IF MANY OF THE SOLAR PANELS ARE NOT COLLECTING A LOT OF ENERGY IT MIGHT
SO WITH AN AGEING POPULATION SUCH SMART SOLUTIONS ARE ACTUALLY VERY USEFUL
AND THEY CAN EVEN PREDICT A POTENTIAL FAILURE BEFORE IT EVEN HAPPENS SO THAT WE CAN GO AND FIX IT
EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT BEING SMART
BUT ARE WE READY TO BE SMART
HOW MUCH SUN ACTUALLY FALLS ON THE SURFACES OF THE TOWN AND ON THE BUILDINGS
BECAUSE I THINK THE THING WE FORGET IS WE TEND CRAZY BECAUSE MUSIC IS SUCH A COMMUNAL ACTIVITY BUT WE TEND
THEY HAVE SOCIAL KNITS THAT ARE VERY CLOSE
LIKE 99 PERCENT OF ALL THE ANIMALS THAT HAVE ONCE LIVED THEY GO EXTINCT LIKELY DUE TO A WARMING CLIMATE AND
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE ELEPHANTS SHARE MANY THINGS IN COMMON WITH US
THEY BURY THEIR DEAD
THEY EDUCATE THE NEXT OF KIN
THE ICECAPS WERE MUCH BIGGER
SO WE'RE PRETTY SURE THE OCEAN HAS A LOT TO DO WITH THIS
IT WAS COLLECTED FROM CLOSE TO ANTARCTICA THOUSANDS OF METERS BELOW THE SEA SO VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE
THEY COVERED LOTS OF THE CONTINENT AND THEY EXTENDED OUT OVER THE OCEAN
BUT 4000 YEARS IS NOT ENOUGH TO GET US BACK TO OUR LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM
SO WE USE A LASER TO ANALYZE URANIUM AND ONE OF ITS DAUGHTER PRODUCTS THORIUM IN THESE CORALS AND THAT TELLS US
I LOOK AT THE CHEMISTRY OF THE OCEAN TODAY
AND I'VE JUST GIVEN YOU A CARTOON VERSION OF ONE OF THE MAJOR DIFFERENCES YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN IF YOU WENT BACK THAT LONG
I LOOK AT THE CHEMISTRY OF THE OCEAN IN THE PAST
THE WAY I LOOK BACK IN THE PAST IS BY USING THE FOSSILIZED REMAINS OF DEEPWATER CORALS
YOU CAN SEE AN IMAGE OF ONE OF THESE CORALS BEHIND ME
OKAY SO THAT'S NUMBER ONE
WE WERE OUTSIDE IT WAS LATE AT NIGHT AND WE WERE WONDERING WHERE WE WERE GOING WE WERE LOST
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED
NUMBER TWO WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY IS MOVE TOWARD YOUNG BLACK MEN INSTEAD OF AWAY FROM THEM
AND WE WONDER WHY THESE BIASES DON'T DIE AND MOVE FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION
I MEAN YOU JUST HAVE TO DO IT
WE REALLY NEED TO RELAX ABOUT THIS
LIKE I DON'T THINK THIS IS GOING TO WORK FOR ME
WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT
I MEAN IT'S THE SAME STORY
IT'S JUST DIFFERENT NAMES
THE STATE'S NOT ALONE
THE NARRATIVES THAT WE USE NOW TEND TO BE THE RISE AND FALL OF THE GREAT POWERS
SO WE'VE GOT WHAT 17 MORE YEARS TO GO OR SO BEFORE CHINA'S BIGGER
POWER IS MULTI POLAR
AND YOU CAN THINK BACK TO 1941 WHEN THE GOVERNMENT OF JAPAN ATTACKED THE UNITED STATES
ALL THIS STILL PERSISTS
AND THAT THE CHINESE WON'T CATCH UP OR PASS THE AMERICANS UNTIL SOMEWHERE IN THE LATTER PART AFTER
AND AS I SAID EARLIER CHINA HAS NOT PASSED THE UNITED STATES
THE STATE STILL MATTERS
FOR ONE THING GERMANY HAD SURPASSED BRITAIN IN INDUSTRIAL STRENGTH BY 1900
THERE ARE MANY MANY ACTORS
THE MORAL OF THIS STORY IS ALL THESE NARRATIVES ABOUT RISE AND FALL AND DECLINE TELL US A LOT MORE ABOUT
IT'S NOT JUST PREVAILING AT WAR THOUGH WAR STILL PERSISTS
KEEPING BALANCES IS IMPORTANT
BUT WE NEED A NEW NARRATIVE IF WE'RE TO UNDERSTAND POWER IN THE 21ST CENTURY
CHINA STILL HAS LARGE AREAS OF UNDERDEVELOPMENT AND PER CAPITA INCOME IS A BETTER MEASURE OF
LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE FROM HISTORY
NOW I DON'T MEAN TO BE POLLYANNAISH ABOUT THIS
IT'S BAD HISTORY
AND THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS I HAVE
THE BOTTOM BOARD OF THIS THREE DIMENSIONAL THE BOARD OF TRANSNATIONAL RELATIONS THINGS THAT
HARD POWER IS THERE AND IT WILL REMAIN
POWER IS CHAOTICALLY DISTRIBUTED
FIRST OF ALL IT'S A LINEAR PROJECTION
YOU MIGHT THINK OF THAT AS THE PRIVATIZATION OF WAR
FOR EXAMPLE THE GREAT OXFORD HISTORIAN WHO TAUGHT HERE AT THIS UNIVERSITY A
SO EMPOWERING CHINA TO DEAL WITH ITS OWN PROBLEMS OF CARBON
NOTICE BOTH HALVES OF THAT EXPLANATION
TO PARAPHRASE FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT FROM A DIFFERENT CONTEXT THE GREATEST THING WE HAVE TO FEAR
AND IN THE 21ST CENTURY YOU HAVE TO DO AN ANALOG TO THAT
BUT THE STAGE IS CROWDED
ANYBODY CAN PLAY IN THE GAME
IF THEY HAVE THE PRICE OF ENTRY INTO AN INTERNET CAFE THE LAST TIME I LOOKED IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE A POUND AN
AND THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS AND THIS IS WHERE MANY GREATEST CHALLENGES ARE COMING IN THIS CENTURY
AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS NOT THAT THE AGE OF THE STATE IS OVER
THERE ARE BALANCERS THE U
THUCYDIDES THE GREAT HISTORIAN OF THE THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR SAID IT WAS THE RISE IN THE POWER OF
THEY SAID IT IS THE ACCESS TO THE FRESHEST IDEAS IT IS THE POWERFUL NETWORK OF
THIS KNOWLEDGE I PROMISE YOU TO SOME PEOPLE RIGHT NOW CAN BE SERVING AS A LIFE
HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO GET THERE
AND WHY QUALITY
OH MY GOD THAT'S AMAZING
I TRULY BELIEVE THAT EVERYONE OF US AS WE SIT HERE HAS SOME VALUABLE KNOWLEDGE AND
BY A CERTAIN AGE WE SHOULD ACQUIRE THIS AMOUNT OF PHYSICS AND THIS AMOUNT OF GEOGRAPHY BY A CERTAIN AGE
I TRAVELED AND WORKED AROUND THE WORLD
BECAUSE IF WE PASS ON MEDIOCRE EXPERIENCE MEDIOCRE KNOWLEDGE PEOPLE WILL ASK MEDIOCRE
I ACTUALLY RECENTLY WENT TO A TINY TROPICAL ISLAND AND I WAS LYING ON THE BEACH UNDER ONE OF THOSE TREES OF
THIS EXPERIENCE OPENED MY EYES TO THE FACT THAT THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE SOMETHING
THIS TO ME IS A FUNDAMENTAL QUALITY OF OUR HUMANITY
I FELT LIKE I WAS BECOMING A FRAUD
I BECAME FREE
PEOPLE OPENED UP TO ME
AND YOU DON'T NEED TO GO HITCHHIKING
THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION SAYS THAT DEPRESSION IS FAST BECOMING ONE OF THE BIGGEST PUBLIC
HIGGINS CALLED TO APPOINT ME TO THE COUNCIL OF STATE
PARTS OF ME CAME TOGETHER AGAIN
PEOPLE STARTED TO GIVE ME MONEY DONATING ONLINE AND HANDING IT TO ME AS I WENT WHICH WAS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE I
PEOPLE STARTED FOLLOWING IT
YOUR VOICE MATTERS
I REMEMBERED WHO I WAS AND WHAT IT WAS ABOUT
MOSTLY PEOPLE WERE FIGHTING FOR HOPE DETERMINED NEVER TO GIVE UP PEOPLE LIKE JANE IN WEXFORD WHO
EVERYWHERE I WENT I POSTED SOCIAL MEDIA UPDATES
BUT I'M SURE HE COULD SEE THAT I WAS A WRECK
HOW CAN I SPEAK ABOUT CITIZENS' VIEWS OF THE FUTURE
I THOUGHT I'LL GO AROUND THE COUNTRY AND ASK PEOPLE WHAT THEIR VIEWS ARE
I'D SOLD MY CAR BECAUSE I NEEDED THE MONEY
NOW PEOPLE WILL SAY I'M A DREAMER
WELL THAT'S NOT QUITE RIGHT
AND SO I STARTED THINKING ABOUT THIS PROBLEM THIS VERY VERY CHALLENGING PROBLEM ELEMENTS THAT BEHAVE VERY VERY
AND IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT ABOUT HYDRO ELECTRIC
FUEL ROD ASSEMBLY IS ONLY ABOUT THIS BIG
WE KNOW WHAT CARBON DIOXIDE IS DOING WE KNOW HOW IT IS GLOBALLY CHANGING OUR
AND YOU GO TO ONE OF THESE CONVENTIONS AND SOME DUDE BUILT THE TITANIC
LIKE AM I INTO THIS
A METALLIC TOILET AGAINST THE BACK RIGHT ONE OF THOSE MATTRESSES YOU PRACTICE SIT UPS ON
AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IDENTITY CONFERS POWER ACCESS AND
AND THIS IMPORTANTLY SUGGESTS THAT OUR IDENTITIES ARE NOT ENTIRELY WITHIN OUR CONTROL
NOW SINCE I CAN SEE YOU'RE ALL WONDERING I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU SOME ANSWERS
AS A TEENAGER I HAD BEGUN TO REALIZE THAT MY RELIGION MY IDENTITY AND THE PHYSICAL EXPRESSION OF THESE
THIS IS BECAUSE OUR REFLECTIONS ARE ONLY A MIRROR IMAGE OF OUR TRUE SELVES
EXTROVERTED PERSONALITIES SUCH AS THE KARDASHIANS WHETHER YOU LOVE THEM OR HATE THEM HAVE MANAGED TO TURN THEIR
BUT ALSO DEMANDED TO BE TREATED AS AN EQUAL
IT CAME AS A SHOCK TO BE CALLED A FREAK BUT WHAT MADE IT PAINFUL WAS THAT I DIDN'T KNOW THIS GIRL IN FACT
I WANT MY QUIRKS AND MY INTRICACIES TO BE UNDERSTOOD AND FULLY APPRECIATED
IT MAY SURPRISE YOU TO KNOW THAT IT IS THE FIFTH LARGEST RELIGION IN THE WORLD
SO AS I FINISHED MY SCHOOL I BEGAN TO TELL PEOPLE I DON'T DRINK AND I DON'T CUT MY HAIR
AND YET AS RESEARCH HAS SHOWN MOST OF US PREFER LOOKING AT OUR MIRROR IMAGE
AT SCHOOL I QUICKLY BECAME KNOWN AS THE GIRL WITH THE LONG HAIR A CATCHY MONIKER BUT NOT QUITE
I WANT TO BE SEEN AS A NUANCED YOUNG WOMAN WHOSE EXPERIENCES AND
SO THIS IS JUST PART OF A MORE COMPLEX ISSUE
YOU'VE NOW REACHED AN AGE WHERE YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN DECISIONS AND IF YOU WANT TO CUT IT YOU CAN
NOW UNTIL I STARTED SCHOOL I NEVER REALIZED THAT THIS LENGTH OF HAIR WAS AT ALL UNUSUAL
ON A PRACTICAL LEVEL IN THE UNITED STATES IDENTITY THEFT DEPRIVES THE US ECONOMY OF
HENCE WHY POLITICS ADVERTISING AND SOCIAL MEDIA ARE SUCH POWERFUL DRIVERS OF OUR THINKING
WE MIGHT THINK THAT WE ARE BEING PERCEIVED IN A CERTAIN WAY OR BELIEVE THAT OUR ACTIONS ARE SHAPING THE VIEWS OF OTHERS
ONE INCIDENT THAT IS ETCHED FIRMLY INTO MY MEMORY HAPPENED WHEN I WAS AT A SCHOOL CAMP AGE TEN
AND YET REMARKABLY FEW OF US HAVE AN ACCURATE CONCEPTION OF OUR OWN IDENTITIES
I WOULD DREAM ABOUT JUST BEING A GIRL RATHER THAN THE GIRL WITH LONG HAIR
OVER MY LIFE THERE HAVE BEEN MANY EXPERIENCES LIKE THIS WHICH HAVE MADE ME WANT TO CHOP IT ALL OFF
NOW WHEN I ASK MY FRIENDS WHAT DEFINES ME THEY OFTEN SAY THAT IT'S MY INTERMINABLE SARCASM OR MY
ONE KEY PRACTICE OF THE FAITH IS NOT TO CUT YOUR HAIR
AND NOT ONE PERSON THROUGHOUT MY ENTIRE SCHOOLING EVER QUESTIONNED THE VALIDITY OF ME PERFORMING THESE
NOW I'M AUSTRALIAN AND AUSTRALIANS LOVE TO DRINK
BUT I QUICKLY CAUGHT UP AND BEFORE LONG HAD A FULL HEAD OF HAIR
WE LIKE IT SIMPLY BECAUSE IT IS MORE FAMILIAR TO US
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO WASH
THAT'S HOW WE ACTUALLY LOOK
HAVE YOU EVER CUT IT
ANOTHER WAY OF THINKING ABOUT THIS IS THE NUMBER OF AUTOMATIC ASSOCIATIONS WE MAKE WHEN WE MEET SOMEONE
AS A YOUNG GIRL I WOULD OFTEN STARE INTO THE MIRROR AND FANTASIZE ABOUT HAVING A SHORT SOPHISTICATED BOB
OR TELL THEM THAT YOU'VE ALREADY HAD ENOUGH TO DRINK
BECAUSE WE IDENTIFY WITH THEM AND PLACE OUR TRUST IN THEM
SO IT'S NO SURPRISE THEN THAT WE SPEND SO MUCH OF OUR TIME THINKING ABOUT WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE WOULD LIKE
IT'S ABOUT RECOGNIZING THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL IS COMPLEX AND CAPABLE OF THE ENTIRE BREADTH OF
OUR TRUE SELVES ARE CAPTURED IN A PHOTOGRAPH
FIRST SIKHS BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE WERE CREATED AS THEY WERE MEANT TO BE AND THEREFORE BY NOT CUTTING OUR HAIR
WELL AS I WALK AROUND OXFORD I SEE PEOPLE WITH TATTOOS CRAZY COLORED HAIR AND PUNK ROCK
ALL SHE KNEW ABOUT ME WAS THAT I HAD LONG HAIR
MORE SPECIFICALLY HOW WE SEE OURSELVES IN OUR MINDS OUR PERSONAL IDENTITIES ARE ONLY EVER PARTIALLY
I WAS STANDING IN MY BATHROOM BRUSHING MY HAIR MY MOM WALKED IN AND JUST LOOKED AT ME AND SAID
NOW I'M SURE ALL OF US HAVE EXPERIENCED THAT MOMENT WHEN YOU'RE WALKING ALONG IN A SHOPPING CENTER IMMERSED
AND THAT IS IMPORTANT
EACH OF US IS COMING TO TERMS WITH OUR OWN DISTINCTIVENESS
WITH ADOLESCENCE CAME THE ADDITIONAL PEER PRESSURE OF DRINKING ALCOHOL
BUT BY THIS STAGE I WAS BEYOND PRETENDING
AND MY ALL TIME FAVORITE HAVE YOU EVER SAT ON IT
WE ARE MORE COMFORTABLE WITH THINGS THAT ARE MORE FAMILIAR TO US EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY NOT BE
THEY STARTED WHEN I WAS SIX AND HAVE NEVER REALLY STOPPED SINCE
IN FACT IN AUSTRALIA DRINKING IS MORE POPULAR THAN SWIMMING AND PROBABLY MORE FUNDAMENTAL TO AUSTRALIAN
THERE ARE THREE MAIN REASONS FOR THIS
WE ENDED UP BETTER GET TOGETHER WITH FRIENDS
WE CAN USE IT FROM ONE PATIENT TO THE NEXT
A WINDPIPE CELL ALREADY KNOWS IT'S A WINDPIPE CELL
BUT THEY ARE REALLY ACTING MOSTLY AS CONDUITS
AND THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT YOU'RE SEEING
SO WE PREFER ORGAN SPECIFIC CELLS
WE STARTED IMPLANTING SOME OF THESE STRUCTURES OVER 14 YEARS AGO
THEY ARE NOT NEARLY AS COMPLEX AS HOLLOW ORGANS
WHILE AT THE SAME TIME THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF TRANSPLANTS HAS REMAINED ALMOST ENTIRELY FLAT
IT DISINTEGRATES A FEW MONTHS LATER
IT'S ACTING ONLY AS A CELL DELIVERY VEHICLE
NOW YOU MUST HAVE ALL TAKEN A BAND AID OFF AT SOME POINT AND YOU MUST HAVE WONDERED WHAT'S THE RIGHT APPROACH
YOU WOULD EXPECT THAT AS THE AMOUNT OF MONEY ON THE TABLE INCREASES PEOPLE WOULD CHEAT MORE BUT IN FACT IT WASN'T THE CASE
BUT IF IT'S SOMEBODY FROM ANOTHER GROUP THESE TERRIBLE PEOPLE I MEAN NOT TERRIBLE IN THIS BUT SOMEBODY WE DON'T WANT TO ASSOCIATE
I FELT MY INTUITION WAS CORRECT
OR HOW PAINFUL WAS THIS
COULD IT BE THAT WITH THOSE MORE DISTANT THINGS IT'S NOT A TOKEN FOR ONE SECOND IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS MANY STEPS REMOVED
AND YOU WEIGH THESE OPTIONS OUT YOU DO THE SIMPLE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS AND YOU DECIDE WHETHER IT'S WORTHWHILE TO COMMIT THE CRIME OR
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE GROUP
AT ONE HAND WE ALL WANT TO LOOK AT OURSELVES IN THE MIRROR AND FEEL GOOD ABOUT OURSELVES SO WE DON'T WANT TO CHEAT
AND WE THOUGHT MAYBE WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THAT THERE ARE TWO FORCES
GO HOME AND THEY WENT WITH THE MONEY
THEY CHEAT JUST BY A LITTLE BIT
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DO OTHER THINGS LIKE YOU REMOVE THINGS FROM MONEY
IN FACT EVERY DAY WHEN WE OPEN THE NEWS WE SEE EXAMPLES OF PEOPLE CHEATING
WE GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE CHEATING BY STEALING BY A LITTLE BIT
SO WE SAID IF PEOPLE ARE NOT SENSITIVE TO THE ECONOMIC RATIONAL THEORY EXPLANATIONS TO THESE FORCES
NOW IF WE THINK ABOUT THIS IN TERMS OF THE STOCK MARKET THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS
IF THESE NURSES WOULD HAVE BEEN WILLING TO CHECK THEIR INTUITION AND HOW EVERYTHING WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF WE JUST START DOING MORE SYSTEMATIC
I WOULD PASS THEIR SHEET OF PAPER
AND I WOULD TRY TO REASON WITH THEM AND SAY WHY DON'T WE TRY SOMETHING ELSE
IT'S IN EVERY LANGUAGE I'VE HAD EXPERIENCE WITH SO FAR
SO THAT'S WHAT I DID
AND WHEN WE SEE CHEATING AROUND US PARTICULARLY IF IT'S A PART OF OUR IN GROUP CHEATING GOES UP
THEY HAVE A MALL THERE THE DUBAI MALL
I WAS IN DUBAI
I WENT DOWN TO THE LOBBY AND SAW THIS INDIAN GUY
OUT OF MY WAY
I'LL BE BACK AND HE WALKED AWAY
AND IT'S GREAT THERE'S GOOD PEOPLE EVERYWHERE
IT'S THREE MILES AWAY
WHERE I'VE HAD PROBLEMS IS IN SOME OF THE ARAB COUNTRIES
AND I'VE BEEN GUILTY OF STEREOTYPING AS WELL
HE WENT OUT SOLO AND DID IT FIRST
CAN YOU SAY I WILL KILL YOU IN THE NAME OF ALLAH
ALL IT TAKES IN ONE PERSON TO MESS IT UP
LIKE IN THE DUBAI MALL THEY SELL FROZEN YOGURT BY THE GRAM
FOR EXAMPLE I TOOK MY TWO YEAR OLD SON TO THE PLAYGROUND AT THE DUBAI MALL
THAT'S WHAT I TRY AND SHOW IN MY STAND UP GOOD PEOPLE EVERYWHERE
I WAS DOING A SHOW AND THEY SAID WE'LL SEND A DRIVER TO PICK YOU UP
FOR EXAMPLE DUBAI COOL PLACE
I JUST DID A SEVEN COUNTRY SOLO TOUR
I WAS IN OMAN AND I WAS IN SAUDI ARABIA
I WAS IN DUBAI
I GO I'M SORRY
I WANT TO ROB A BANK
I'M ALSO VERY CURIOUS ABOUT ANXIETY
SO WHEN WE GET OUT OF THE CAR PCHING
SO YOU MAY WANT TO START READING ABOUT BRAIN DEVELOPMENT ABOUT CHILDHOOD
AND NONE OF THAT IS GOOD STUFF EITHER
THAT'S GREAT OK NO WORRIES
I HAVE EXPERIENCED IT MYSELF AND I'VE WORKED WITH MANY MANY MANY ANXIOUS PEOPLE OVER THE
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
AND ASHLEY HAVE BEEN REFERRED TO ME WHEN I WAS WORKING FOR WISH FOR A BRIGHTER FUTURE WHICH IS A
THIS IS NOT EXCITING ENOUGH
OUR CHILDREN FIND STUFF AS WELL TO NUMB THEIR MEERKATS OUT
ONCE WE GOT THERE AND SHE GOT OUT OF THE CAR A DIFFERENT ASHLEY
I DID NOT MAKE THIS UP
SO BECOME MEERKAT OBSERVERS OF YOURSELF AND OF OTHERS AND TAKE THE TROUBLE
OK SO MAYBE ANOTHER TEN MINUTES EARLIER THAN THAT
WHAT IF THERE'S A QUEUE TO GET IN
YOU CAN'T RESERVE YOUR SEAT
WE BETTER GET IN THAT QUEUE
THEY LOVE RHYTHM MEERKATS
I WANTED TO BE A FARMER I'M FROM NEBRASKA
IT'S A PHOTO THAT'S HAPPENING NOW IT'S GOING VIRAL NOW
I MEAN THAT'S PART OF HOW EMOTIONS WORK
ANOTHER WAY TO SAY THIS THOUGH IS THAT PEOPLE
WHEN HIS GRANDMOTHER'S AWAY HE HAS SEX WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND ON HIS GRANDMA'S BED
HE JUMPS BACK AND HE GAGS AND WE HAD TO DO IT THREE TIMES
THIS MAKES IT VERY USEFUL AS A STRATEGY IF YOU WANT TO CONVINCE SOMEBODY THAT AN OBJECT OR AN INDIVIDUAL OR AN ENTIRE
IT TURNS OUT THAT THIS SCORE IS ACTUALLY MEANINGFUL
IT'S WHEN I SAY UM HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY
THE QUESTION WORKS EVEN WHEN IT DOESN'T
BUT IT ALSO GIVES THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE SOMETHING WITH THE COURT THAT GOES BEYOND THEIR CRIMINAL RECORD
PART TWO WAS KNOWN AS THE WORST COURTROOM IN THE CITY SOME FOLKS WOULD EVEN SAY IN THE STATE
THE NEXT PRINCIPLE IS UNDERSTAND
SIR I'M NOT LETTING YOU SPEAK RIGHT NOW
IF I BELIEVED ONE POSITIVE THING ABOUT MYSELF HOW WOULD MY LIFE BE DIFFERENT
NAVAL INTELLIGENCE PROJECT
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE DRUGS YOU HAVE A REASONABLY GOOD
ANOTHER CALLED TWISTER AND SO ON AND SO ON
WHILE I HAD BEEN SAVING SOME MONEY FOR MY ULTIMATE RETIREMENT I HAD ALSO BEEN PUTTING MONEY ASIDE
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO PRUDENTIAL UNVEILED A BILLBOARD THAT SAID THAT THE FIRST PERSON WAS BORN WHO WILL
DON'T PUT ALL OF YOUR EGGS IN ONE BASKET
INTUIT THE SOFTWARE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS
WHAT I'M SUGGESTING THAT YOU DO IS START TO THINK ABOUT YOUR LIFE STORY AND LOOK AT YOUR
YOUR GOLDEN YEARS ARE RIGHT NOW
DON'T DO THAT
SPREAD YOUR RISK AROUND
LIVING TO BE THAT OLD
UNDER THAT SCENARIO YOU COULD STILL BE AN INTERN WHEN YOU'RE 50 AND WHEN YOU REACH THE AGE OF 70 LEARN THAT YOU'RE ONLY
INSTEAD OF WAITING UNTIL THE FINAL CHAPTER OF LIFE TO RETIRE WE SHOULD TAKE SMALL INTERIM
WHAT ARE WE DOING
ASK YOURSELF ONE QUESTION
WE CALL OURSELVES PORS AND RAO AND WE LIVE AND WORK IN INDIA
I'D LIKE TO BEGIN WITH MY VERY FIRST OBJECT WHICH I CALL THE UNCLE PHONE
SO WE WORKED WITH A COMPANY THAT SPECIALIZES IN CAMERA SURVEILLANCE AND WE ASKED THEM TO DEVELOP A PIECE OF SOFTWARE WITH US
AND IF YOU MOVE ANY SLOWER THAN THAT THEN YOU'RE MOVING TOO SLOW ANY FURTHER THAN THAT AND YOU'RE JUST DREAMING
SO CAN WE EXPRESS THIS IDEA THAT MAGICAL MOMENT OF WHERE THE PRACTICAL MEETS THE POSSIBLE
CAN YOU EXPRESS THAT IN MUSIC
START WITH FIVE OK
BUT REALLY WHAT CAN IT EXPRESS
AND THE CURRENCY I'M GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT IS CARBON DIOXIDE
AND IT SIMPLY GROWS
AND AT EACH THRESHOLD THE GOING GETS TOUGHER
AND IT WOULD COME BARRELING DOWN AT HER OVER THE LANDSCAPE
OTHERWISE GO BOTHER SOMEBODY ELSE TODAY
AND I ALWAYS HAVE BEEN
AND I WOULD IMAGINE THAT A LOT OF YOU HAVE TOO
TO YOU NONETHELESS
WHICH IS GREAT BECAUSE WE NEED THAT
WHEN I HEARD THAT STORY IT STARTED TO SHIFT A LITTLE BIT THE WAY THAT I WORKED TOO AND THIS IDEA ALREADY SAVED ME ONCE
BUT THEN I REMEMBERED TOM TALKING TO THE OPEN AIR AND I TRIED IT
I STILL HAVE MAYBE ANOTHER FOUR DECADES OF WORK LEFT IN ME
AREN'T YOU AFRAID YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP WRITING FOR YOUR WHOLE LIFE AND YOU'RE NEVER AGAIN GOING TO CREATE A BOOK THAT ANYBODY
AREN'T YOU AFRAID THE HUMILIATION OF REJECTION WILL KILL YOU
AREN'T YOU AFRAID THAT YOU'RE GOING TO WORK YOUR WHOLE LIFE AT THIS CRAFT AND NOTHING'S EVER GOING TO COME OF IT AND YOU'RE GOING TO DIE ON A SCRAP
TO ME THAT'S THE ESSENCE OF JOURNALISM AND THAT'S WHAT I'M COMMITTED TO DOING
HE TRIED NOT TO EVER HAVE HIS PERSONAL LIFE SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION AND SO I THINK CALLING HIM
WE MAKE JUDGMENTS EVERY SINGLE DAY ABOUT THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE SAY AND THINK AND DO THAT WE'RE WILLING TO HAVE OTHER PEOPLE
TO ME THAT'S THE WAY THAT PRIVACY CAN BE REJUVENATED
WE CAN TRY AND RENDER THE CHAINS OF MASS SURVEILLANCE INVISIBLE OR UNDETECTABLE BUT THE CONSTRAINTS THAT IT
I GET OUT A PEN I WRITE DOWN MY EMAIL ADDRESS
I SAY HERE'S MY EMAIL ADDRESS
IT'S A VERY DESOLATE PLACE
WHY IS THAT
AND RATHER THAN SPEND A LOT MORE TIME TALKING ABOUT IT I'M GOING TO QUEUE UP A LITTLE VIDEO
WE TRIED TO USE BEST PRACTICES AND BELIEVE ME THE PEOPLE THERE WHEN WE SET OUT
AND I BELIEVE THAT WIND POWER IS ONE WAY TO DO THAT
BEN CAME UP AFTER WE GOT THINGS GOING
IT'S ALL I CAN DO TO UNZIP ONE
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE STATE OR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT COMES TO THE RESCUE
HAS ANYONE HERE SEEN THOSE
SO THEY HAD SEEN A LOT OF UPS AND DOWNS AND IT'S TOUGH ENOUGH TO BE A FARMER
256 FAMILIES SIGNED OUR POOLING EASEMENT AGREEMENT
AND THAT'S NOT BECAUSE A COMPANY LIKE MULTI HEALTH SYSTEMS DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH DATA
THERE'S ANOTHER TOOL THAT CAN DO THAT AND WE ALL HAVE IT AND THAT TOOL IS THE BRAIN
SO YOU SEE ROY PRICE IS A SENIOR EXECUTIVE WITH AMAZON STUDIOS
EVEN THE MOST DATA SAVVY COMPANIES GET IT WRONG
TED SARANDOS AND HIS TEAM MADE THAT DECISION TO LICENSE THAT SHOW WHICH ALSO MEANT BY THE WAY THAT THEY
THEY USED DATA ALL THE WAY TO DRIVE THEIR DECISION MAKING FIRST WHEN THEY HELD THEIR COMPETITION OF TV IDEAS THEN
THAT'S THE TV PRODUCTION COMPANY OF AMAZON
THEY ARE BEING WATCHED BY ROY PRICE AND HIS TEAM WHO RECORD EVERYTHING
AND ALL OF THAT GOES BACK TO A DECISION THAT ROY HAD TO MAKE ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO
THEY RECORD WHEN SOMEBODY PRESSES PLAY WHEN SOMEBODY PRESSES PAUSE WHAT PARTS THEY SKIP WHAT PARTS THEY WATCH AGAIN
MY FRIEND SAID WELL WHY DON'T YOU SPEND THE NIGHT AND YOU CAN COME BACK TOMORROW
IT CAN BE A RADICAL ACT
I FELT MONET'S SPIRIT
I WAS VISUALIZING MY NEW BLOOM AS WELL
THE BEAUTY CALLED HIM BACK
YOU'VE GOT TO WORK IT
THE DAHLIAS AND THE ASTERS TOWERED ABOVE ME
I FELT THE TRANQUILITY AND PEACE
I ALSO FELT THE SPIRIT OF THE PLACE
IT JUST IT WAS EVERYWHERE FOR A LONG TIME AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO MIGHT'VE REMEMBERED THE LATE 70S EARLY 80S
SO I STARTED JUST FOR FUN I PULLED OUT 3 OF MY FAVORITE GAMES
THE WAY IT LOOKED THE WAY IT FELT THE WAY IT SOUNDED
IN 83 84 THE INDUSTRY WAS ALMOST NON EXISTED
IT JUST BEGAN TO SORT OF POPULATE THROUGHOUT ALL OF CULTURE BOTH GAMING AND NON
BUT VIDEO GAMES I WAS INSTANTLY CAPTIVATED BY
AND SO BEING IN THIS NEW WORLD WHERE I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ANY FRIENDS THIS GAVE ME SOMETHING TO DIG DEEP INTO
AND IT GAVE SOMETHING FOR MY SISTER AND I TO PLAY IT TOGETHER
I MAKE TELEVISION A GREAT DEAL OF TELEVISION
THE HUM IS ACTION AND ACTIVITY
MY BRAIN IS STILL GLOBAL
IT IS HITTING EVERY HIGH NOTE
AND YET IT IS EXTRAORDINARY BECAUSE IN MY PAIN AND MY PANIC IN THE HOMELESSNESS OF
I AM NOT THAT HUM
I CREATE TELEVISION
I DON'T NEED THAT HUM
IT IS PAINTING A CANVAS
THE HUM IS MUSIC
THERE IS SOME KIND OF SHIFT INSIDE ME WHEN THE WORK GETS GOOD
I LOVE WORKING
WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN
THE REAL HUM IS CONFIDENCE AND PEACE
I PLAY AND I PLAY UNTIL I BEGIN TO WONDER WHY WE EVER STOP PLAYING IN THE FIRST PLACE
THE HUM IS A DRUG
IT IS RUNNING A MARATHON
IT IS BEING BEYONC
BUT IT IS OK
I AM THAT HUM
I EXECUTIVE PRODUCE TELEVISION
HARPER TELLS PEOPLE MY MOM WON'T BE THERE BUT YOU CAN TEXT MY NANNY
I COULDN'T RESTART THE ENGINE
I'M NOT PERFECT AT IT BUT I TRY HARD TO PRACTICE IT
THE MORE I PLAY THE BETTER I WORK
THE REAL HUM IS GOD'S WHISPER IN MY EAR BUT MAYBE GOD WAS WHISPERING THE WRONG WORDS BECAUSE WHICH ONE OF THE GODS WAS TELLING
IF YOU WANTED A FIRST AIDER OR AN EXPERT IN FIRE EXTINGUISHERS THERE WAS STEVE OR ANDY
AND OF COURSE THE DYING OF COMMUNITY IN AN AGE WHERE DIRECT COMMUNICATION HAS BEEN
THEY WERE QUITTING JOBS THEY DIDN'T LIKE
SOMETIMES EVEN BEING MADE REDUNDANT
WE DON'T REALLY NEED MUCH FROM ANYONE
SO WE ENGAGE LESS
COMPANIES THAT ARE COMMITTED TO DIVERSITY AND INCLUSIVE PRACTICES TEND TO
PEOPLE WHO OVERCOME ADVERSITY DON'T DO IT ALONE
SHE WATCHED ME WORK AND ENCOURAGED ME TO FOCUS ON MY FUTURE AND NOT DWELL ON MY
A RESUME TELLS A STORY
HE NEVER FINISHES COLLEGE
THEY EMBRACE THEIR TRAUMA AND HARDSHIPS AS KEY ELEMENTS OF WHO THEY'VE BECOME AND KNOW
NOW IT'S VERY EASY TO ASSUME THAT THOSE BOOKS BECAUSE THEY WERE FROM A LIBRARY CALLED BAIT AL HIKMA WERE MUSLIM BOOKS BUT THAT'S NOT THE
RED WAS MADE ILLEGAL
WE HAD A BABY
IT'S A STORY PASSED ON GENERATION AFTER GENERATION
AND HE SAID HI
AND I TOOK AWAY THE NAME OF THE WRITER THE NAME OF THE UNCLEAR EVERYTHING WAS GONE EXCEPT THE FACTS
I'M LICENSED IN NEW YORK STATE
IN A WORLD LIKE THAT THEY'LL ALWAYS BE A JOB FOR SUPERMAN AND THE 99
I BECAME TIMELY
THE SECOND IS COLUMBUS FINALLY GETS FUNDED TO GO TO INDIA BUT HE GETS LOST
IN OCTOBER 2010 THE JUSTICE LEAGUE OF AMERICA WILL BE TEAMING UP WITH THE 99
THOSE ARE BASIC HUMAN VALUES
AND SO THE BACKSTORY OF THE 99 TAKES PLACE IN 1258 WHICH HISTORY TELLS US THE MONGOLS INVADED BAGHDAD AND
KUSH TRANSLATED INTO GUJARATI SOMETHING RAVI HAD NEVER SEEN
I SPENT JUST TWO DAYS IN HIS PLACE AND I COUGHED FOR A WEEK
AFTER ABOUT A YEAR IN LAW SCHOOL I ALMOST DROPPED OUT
IT'S CALLED THE CONSENT TO OPERATE
NUMBER TWO PUSH YOUR POLITICIANS AND YOUR GOVERNMENTS TO MAKE THIS A PUBLIC
WE SQUEAKED BY
IT'S IMPORTANT IN ITS OWN RIGHT AND IT'S CRUCIAL FOR JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE WE CARE ABOUT
I'M GOING TO CALL HIM KUSH
I'M GOING TO CALL HIM RAVI NANDA
AND THE WORLD SEEMS TO HAVE DECIDED THAT'S OK
I'VE GOT YOU
IT HONESTLY SCARED ME AND STILL DOES TO THINK THAT IF I WERE TO LIVE FOR SAY
WHEN I FLY I FEEL THE WIND BUFFETING MY FACE
IT'S FOR ME TO TRY AND SLOWLY MAKE UP THAT 25 YEARS THAT I WOULD OTHERWISE
THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED THERE REALLY HATED IT
WE HAVE TO TRY THAT
I CAN TELL YOU ALL TO LET YOUR CHILDREN GO JUST AS I HAVE THE SAME THOUGHTS AS YOU WHEN I HEAR
WELL IF YOU'RE ME YOU PROCRASTINATE AND YOU GO ON THE INTERNET
I PLAYED IN THE WOODS I BUILT FORTS I CAUGHT FROGS
ONCE THE KIDS ARE LED ACROSS THE BRIDGE NO ADULT IS ALLOWED TO FOLLOW
IT'S HARD TO DESCRIBE WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT SPACE AND TIME
MOST PEOPLE THINK THAT SURVIVING INSTEAD OF LIVING IS THE ONLY OPTION
YOU'RE NOT REALLY SEEING ME NOW
JUST A MYSTERY
WHY IS THAT
JUST LIKE IN A SONNET OR A TWEET WHERE THE RULES MAKE YOU DO MORE
IF I THROW THEM WHILE I'M RUNNING AWAY THEY'LL GO SLOWER
YOU THINK YOU ARE BUT YOU ARE REALLY SEEING ME AS I WAS ONE HUNDRED NANOSECONDS AGO OR SO
ALL THE CARBON OXYGEN ALL THAT STUFF WAS MADE IN THE FIERY FURNACES OF STARS THAT SPEWED THEIR GUTS INTO
10 TO THE 11 STARTS IN ONE GALAXY
WE SEE A RICHER TAPESTRY
I THINK THERE ARE THREE AMAZING THOUGHTS THAT I LIKE TO KEEP IN MIND
WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE NATURE OF THIS DARK ENERGY AND DARK MATTER
ALL OF THE ATOMS IN YOUR BODY WERE MADE SOMEWHERE
IF THE ALIENS ARE WATCHING US FROM THE NEAREST STARS THEY'RE SEEING US AS WE WERE YEARS AGO
WE ALSO NOW KNOW THAT PLANETS AROUND OTHER STARS ARE COMMON
IN THE TIME IT TOOK ME TO SAY THAT 10 TO THE 12 OF THEM PASSED THROUGH YOUR EYES
BUT THE CONSISTENCY OF THE ANSWERS THAT WE GET SHOW US THAT THIS ASSUMPTION SEEMS TO BE TRUE
AND I WANT YOU TO DO IT IN YOUR OWN WAY
THE TOP OF THE BACK
OURS ARE JUST ARRANGED BETTER
MY OWN SPECIALTY IS NEUTRINOS
AND EACH AND EVERYONE OF US IS LIVING IT TODAY
WHAT IS THE AMERICAN DREAM
BUT NOT JUST A HOME
WE'RE IN A MORE SETTLED TIME OF LIFE
SO EVEN THOUGH SHE HAD A SECOND JOB OFFER AT ANOTHER COMPANY FOR A PERMANENT FULL TIME ROLE SHE DECIDED TO
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO FIND OURSELVES AT AN EMPLOYER'S EXPENSE
WE DID THAT ALREADY
WE HAVE A MORE MATURE PERSPECTIVE
BECAUSE THE INTERNSHIP ALLOWS THE EMPLOYER TO BASE THEIR HIRING DECISION ON AN ACTUAL
IN FACT AN EMPLOYER JUST TOLD ME THAT THEIR VETERANS RETURN TO WORK PROGRAM IS BASED ON THEIR
THINK ABOUT HOW FAR WE HAVE COME
BUT IN THE MEANTIME IF YOU ARE RETURNING TO WORK AFTER A CAREER BREAK DON'T
I HAD DONE MY FINANCIAL ANALYSIS SO LONG AGO THAT I USED LOTUS 1 2
AND THEY DO
WE HAVE FEWER SPOUSAL OR PARTNER JOB RELOCATIONS
I MET TRACY IN JUNE OF 2011 WHEN THE TODAY SHOW ASKED ME IF
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED WITH TRACY IN A LITTLE BIT BUT I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU A DISCOVERY THAT I MADE WHEN I WAS
AND THAT'S EVEN IF YOUR SENSE OF SELF HAS DIMINISHED OVER TIME AS HAPPENS WITH SO MANY OF US THE
IN RATS WE DO THE SAME THING
AND WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT THE MONKEY NUMBER ONE IS MUCH HEALTHIER THAN MONKEY
AND YOU CAN SEE THE TWO GROUPS OF MONKEYS EXTREMELY WELL SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER
AND THERE WERE PREGNANT MOTHERS DURING THAT TIME
IS THERE GOING TO BE A LOT OF FOOD
THE PROBLEM IS WE CANNOT TEST THIS IN HUMANS BECAUSE ETHICALLY WE CANNOT ADMINISTER CHILD ADVERSITY IN A
SO IN THIS EXPERIMENT WE TOOK PLACENTAS OF MONKEYS THAT HAD DIFFERENT SOCIAL STATUS
AND WHEN I TURNED 21 I DECIDED THAT WANTED TO MOVE BACK TO NY CITY AND I WANTED TO WORK TOWARDS GETTING MY COLLEGE
I'LL LOAN YOU THE MONEY IF YOU WANT TO TAKE IT
BUT IT'S A LOAN SO YOU'LL HAVE TO PAY IT BACK
MY DAD SAID PUT TOGETHER A PROPOSAL FOR ME
WHY DO YOU NEED THE MONEY
WHERE'S IT GOING
THERE WERE SOME ALLEGATIONS AS WELL AT THE TIME THE WIVES WERE TREATED AS PROPERTY THE WIVES OF THE WEALTHY
TOKENS COULD BE EXCHANGED FOR MENIAL LABOR
AND THIS IS VERY MUCH PART OF THE KIND OF UTOPIAN ETHOS TO SAIL AWAY
SO I BELIEVE THAT BOZOSITY IS LIKE THE FLU
NOT SPREADSHEET DATABASE OR WORD PROCESSOR
HOW CAN YOU CHANGE THE WORLD
THEY WANTED TO BRING COMPUTING POWER TO EVERYONE
MAKE A MANTRA
HALA SIMPLY COULD NO LONGER COPE
BUT BY IMPROVING PARENTING AND CAREGIVER SUPPORT IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO WEAKEN THE LINKS
BUT IT'S OFTEN THOSE THAT ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SUPPORT THAT WE ACTUALLY DON'T ASK
DESPITE ALL THESE CHALLENGES THEY FACED THEY WERE TRYING TO HELP THEIR CHILDREN
TO HAVE THAT IN MANCHESTER WOULD BE A HUGE ACHIEVEMENT LET ALONE IN A CONFLICT ZONE IN SYRIA
I REMEMBER THE NIGHT THAT I READ ABOUT THE SERIES OF COORDINATED BOMBINGS IN THE SUBWAY SYSTEM IN
THE OTHER SLIP OF PAPER SAYS FOR MY SAKE THE WORLD WAS CREATED
AND I REMEMBER THINKING MY GOD WHAT KIND OF WORLD DID WE BRING THIS CHILD INTO
AND GUESS WHAT
THEY WERE CYNICS AND SEEKERS ATHEISTS AND RABBIS
EVERYTHING FELT SO PRECARIOUS
IT'S A SIGN OF TOTAL SUBMISSION
I CAN'T CONTROL EVERYTHING AND I CANNOT DO THIS ON MY OWN
HOPE MAY BE THE SINGLE GREATEST ACT OF DEFIANCE AGAINST A POLITICS OF
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO CARE WHEN BLACK YOUTH ARE HARASSED BY POLICE BECAUSE MY WHITE LOOKING
TRANSPHOBIA AND ISLAMOPHOBIA AND RACISM OF ALL FORMS THOSE ARE ALSO ALL OF OUR PROBLEMS
WITHIN 12 HOURS 20 MILLION PEOPLE SAW THAT IMAGE OF AYLAN KURDI'S LITTLE BODY WASHED UP
I CAN PROTEST
WE ARE GOING BACK INTO OUR SACRED TRADITIONS AND RECOGNIZING THAT ALL OF OUR TRADITIONS CONTAIN THE
IT'S CALLED PSYCHIC NUMBING
BECAUSE EMMA LAZARUS WAS RIGHT
AND SO I SET OUT TO DO THE ONLY RATIONAL THING THAT SOMEONE WOULD DO IN SUCH A CIRCUMSTANCE I QUIT MY JOB
NOW THROUGHOUT HISTORY PEOPLE HAVE COMMITTED HORRIBLE CRIMES AND ATROCITIES IN THE NAME OF
THE PROBLEM IS THAT AFTER A FEW CENTURIES THE DATE REMAINS ON THE CALENDAR BUT THE LOVE
NOW WE HAD NO MONEY NO SPACE NO GAME PLAN BUT WE DID HAVE EMAIL
AND SO TOO IS ANTI SEMITISM ALL OF OUR PROBLEMS
LISTEN TO THE ANSWER PICK OUT A WORD FOLLOW UP THAT WORD
NOW I'M JUST GOING TO CHECK
IT'S ALL GOOD IT'S FRESH AIR NATURE ELKS SKIING IT'S FANTASTIC
IF THEY OPEN ANOTHER CASH REGISTER THE SAME WILL HAPPEN
RULE NUMBER 1
YVES COMPLAINED A LOT AS WELL
YOU KNOW WHY
THE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT OF SMALL TALK
HOW COULD YOU KNOW THAT
WHY ARE THEY RUNNING FOR THAT CASH REGISTER
WHY IS IT A FREE FOR ALL AND FIRST COME FIRST SERVED
THE NORWEGIAN FOREST IS A GOOD THING ISN'T IT NORWEGIANS IN THE ROOM
BUT THE PROBLEM WAS AND ALANA WILL TELL YOU IS THAT THERE'S SCAR TISSUE WHENEVER YOU PUT ANYTHING
WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO REDUCE THE NEED FOR ANIMAL TESTING AND REDUCE THE NEED FOR HUMAN TESTING
AND SO THESE KIND OF IMPLANTS LED TO A LOT OF REALLY INTERESTING WORK WITH CELLS AND WITH
BUT IMAGINE I MEAN GETTING BACK TO THE RAT THE RAT IS A WHOLE ORGANISM AND AS
SO WHERE DID IT ALL BEGIN
THE BODY SORT OF TREATS IT AS AN INVADER AND BEGINS TO ATTACK IT
SHE HAD A PIECE OF HER HAMSTRING FASHIONED INTO TWO LIGAMENTS
SURGEONS WERE ABLE TO REBUILD HER KNEE FROM A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT SOURCES
BONES YOU MIGHT IMAGINE ARE MECHANICALLY ACTIVE IN A VERY DIFFERENT WAY AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT BONE TISSUE ENGINEERING YOU SEE A
SHE HAD TWO BIOPOLYMER LIGAMENTS AND METAL BUMPERS TO HOLD EVERYTHING TOGETHER
AND COLLABORATORS OF OURS AT TUFTS ARE USING MODELS LIKE THESE WITH TISSUE ENGINEERED BONES TO
KEVIN EGGAN FROM HARVARD IS DOING JUST THAT TAKING CELLS FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE GENES FOR
SHE GOT A DONOR PATELLA
BUT THAT'S IN THE FUTURE
WHAT CAN WE DO NOW
OK SO THAT'S ENGINEERING HEALTHY HUMAN TISSUES BUT WHAT IF WE COULD ENGINEER TISSUES THAT REPLICATE A
IN 1967 WE SAW THE FIRST HEART TRANSPLANTATION FIRST ARTIFICIAL HEART CAME LATER
SHE CAN WALK AND NOW NOT ONLY THAT I MEAN SHE PLAYS BASKETBALL SOFTBALL GYMNASTICS YOU NAME IT
AND IF YOU ASK HER SHE WILL SAY SHE IS EXTREMELY GRATEFUL FOR THE FACT THAT SHE CAN DO ALL THESE THINGS
0 IS GOING TO BE
FOR EXAMPLE WHEN JENNIFER KAHN WANTED TO EXPLAIN THE INCREDIBLE NEW BIOTECHNOLOGY CALLED CRISPR SHE
WELL YOU CAN THINK OF IT AS A PATTERN OF INFORMATION THAT HELPS YOU UNDERSTAND AND
IF YOU CAN REVEAL A DISCONNECTION IN SOMEONE'S WORLDVIEW THEY'LL FEEL THE NEED TO BRIDGE THAT
AND ONCE YOU'VE SPARKED THAT DESIRE IT WILL BE SO MUCH EASIER TO START BUILDING YOUR IDEA
SOMEONE SPENT A COUNTLESS NUMBER OF HOURS SLAMMING DOWN ON THE KEYBOARD TYPING ALL THAT CODE THAT MAKES YOUR
IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER IF YOU AGREE WITH THIS OR NOT
NOW HERE'S A COOL THING ABOUT YOUR VOICE
I ESCAPED I RAN HOME IN TEARS
AND LUCKILY FOR ME THAT DAY MY FATHER WAS HOME EARLY
WHERE ARE THEY
A FEW DAYS AFTER MADISON DIED I BLOGGED ABOUT MY TO DO LIST FOR THE UPCOMING DAY
MANY OF THESE WOMEN WERE JUST LIKE ME
I AM A VOICE
THEY DREAMED OF BECOMING A MOTHER SINCE THEY WERE OLD ENOUGH TO EMULATE THEIR OWN MOTHERS AND GRANDMOTHERS
MOTHERHOOD WAS NOT JUST A DREAM
FOR ME IT WAS A GUARANTEE
YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT BABY ANYWAY
FOOD IS THE ONE AREA THAT YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR
OUR BODIES ARE AMAZING
NOW IN THIS COUNTRY WE SPEND ABOUT 10 OF OUR HOUSEHOLD INCOME ON FOOD
I CAN'T AFFORD NOT TO EAT WELL
OTHER COUNTRIES SPEND ABOUT 30
LOTS OF ANIMAL PRODUCTS
AND SHE WAS FRUSTRATED
SHE SAID IT RUNS IN HIS FAMILY
AND THEN THE PRODUCTION DESIGNER STARTED CLAPPING
I GAVE MY INTRO AND I PLAYED THE JELLYFISH SCENE
AS HUMANS WE HAVE THE WHITE OF OUR EYE THE COLORED IRIS AND THE BLACK PUPIL
AND THE DIRECTOR WAS SILENT FOR AN UNCOMFORTABLY LONG AMOUNT OF TIME
BUT THEN I GOT MY FIRST TASTE OF LIGHTING
THEN WE BROKE IT BACK DOWN TO SEE WHICH ELEMENTS MAKE UP THAT UNDERWATER LOOK
MAYBE BECAUSE UNLIKE NORMAL WE WERE BASING IT ON SOMETHING IN REAL LIFE OR MAYBE JUST BECAUSE WE HAD LOST OUR WAY
AND A DIGITAL TRAIL LIKE THE ONE DANIEL WAS TALKING ABOUT IS NO DIFFERENT
A FRIEND OF MINE WHOM I SHARED AN OFFICE WITH AT THE LAB HAPPENED TO SEE THIS
AND THERE ARE MANY MORE METHODS THAT WE CAN USE
YOUR DIETARY FAILURES MAY NOT BE YOUR FAULT
OTHERS HAVE OPINIONS ON HOW MUCH SUGAR WE SHOULD EAT OR HOW MUCH SALT CHOLESTEROL SATURATED
FOR HUNDRED OF YEARS WE KNOW THAT BACTERIA LIVE WITHIN OUR BODY
THE OVERALL ALGORITHM COMBINED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF SUCH RULES THAT IT AUTOMATICALLY DEDUCED FROM THE DATA
AND HOW IS MY BREATH
POETRY IS THE ART OF TRYING TO SAY SOMETHING WITH WORDS THAT CANNOT BE SAID IN WORDS
BUT THE POLARIZATION KIND OF WENT BOTH WAYS I'D GO SPEND THE SUMMERS IN MEXICO AND MY COUSINS WOULD CALL
WHEN I PICKED UP MY DAUGHTER THAT AFTERNOON SHE WAS VISIBLY UPSET
THAT'D MEAN WE HAD NO MONEY FROM MARKETING OR PR
HER NAME WAS ELLIE
WE DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW THE FUTURE WILL PLAN OUT DO WE
IT WAS LIKE VISITING A MORE INNOCENT TIME ON THE PLANET
THE PROJECT IS PART ART AND PART SCIENCE
